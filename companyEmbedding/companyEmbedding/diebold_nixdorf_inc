 SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ Based on its recent analysis of the self-checkout (SCO) systems market, Frost & Sullivan recognizes Diebold Nixdorf with the 2017 Global Frost & Sullivan Award for Growth Excellence Leadership. Compelling product innovation capabilities, coupled with decades of rich industry experience, make the company a powerful player in the point-of-sale (POS) industry. Following Diebold's acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf in 2016, the combined entity continues to grow impressively in both the United States and Europe.
"Few companies in the SCO market have been able to balance business and product strategies to match customer expectations across retailer categories and geographies," said Frost & Sullivan Industry Analyst Aravindh Vanchesan. "Through its unique value proposition in terms of cost-effective and innovative self-service technology, Diebold Nixdorf is transforming retail and rejuvenating its own growth trajectory."
Outstanding features of Diebold Nixdorf's industry-leading self-checkout and BEETLE product lines include:

Modular and scalable systems enabling customization, easy POS integration, user-friendly interfaces, and a compact footprint
Consulting as an incremental asset to raise efficiency of the checkout zone
Lowest TCO that appeals to all categories of retailers
Innovations that enhance the value proposition by adding short- and long-term revenue streams, establishing customer loyalty
Strong technical support and maintenance services to effectively implement best practices and manage an SCO project from concept to deployment
Diebold Nixdorf focuses on quality rather than quantity, maintaining a price advantage in an otherwise competitive market. As a result of its healthy sales relationships with not only its retail customers but also mobility, security, and segment-specific software providers, Diebold Nixdorf has built a brand name associated with quality, reliability, and security.
Above all, Diebold Nixdorf's end-to-end game-changing technologies and services have helped its growth. For instance, the Red Dot Design Award-winning BEETLE /iSCAN EASY self-checkout portfolio enables consumers to scan and quickly pay for items using cards, mobile wallets, or near-field communication (NFC)-enabled smartphones. At this year's NRF show, the company showcased a new terminal that is less than 10 inches wide, features a highly secure EMV chip reader, and can be used as an ATM, POS terminal, and an SCO unit. Its TPiSHOP application allows retailers to offer smartphone-enabled shopping in-store and from customers' homes.
In a market with limited number of turnkey solution providers, Diebold Nixdorf dominates due to its global presence; it has more than 14,500 field service engineers operating in over 130 countries. In recognition of its continued growth leadership, Frost & Sullivan recognizes Diebold Nixdorf with the 2017 Growth Excellence Leadership Award.
Each year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in growth and customer value. It recognizes the superiority of the product/service as well as the overall customer purchase, ownership, and service experience that has resulted in the recipient seeing above-market growth and increased share of wallet. The award lauds the company's growth, diversification, and sustainability strategies.
Frost & Sullivan Best Practices awards recognize companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service and strategic product development. Industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis and extensive secondary research to identify best practices in the industry.

Diebold Nixdorf (pronounced "DEE-bold NIX-dorf") is an American financial self-service, security and services corporation[4] internationally engaged primarily in the sale, manufacture, installation and service of self-service transaction systems (such as ATMs), electronic and physical security products (including vaults and currency processing systems), software and related services for global financial and commercial markets.[5] Founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company,[7] after becoming incorporated in Ohio in 1876[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Currently headquartered in the Akron-Canton area with facilities in nearby Green,[9][10] in 1921 Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold has since branched into diverse markets, and is currently the largest provider of ATMs in the United States.[5][11] With 2015 revenues of US$2.42 billion,[1] Diebold Nixdorf was founded when Diebold Inc. merged with Germany's Wincor Nixdorf in 2016.[3] It is estimated that Diebold Nixdorf controls about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]

Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]
Computer security and ATMs (1960s-1990s)[edit]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]

Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

Frost & Sullivan Awards Diebold Nixdorf's as Leader in the Self-Checkout Systems Market

 SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ Based on its recent analysis of the self-checkout (SCO) systems market, Frost & Sullivan recognizes Diebold Nixdorf with the 2017 Global Frost & Sullivan Award for Growth Excellence Leadership. Compelling product innovation capabilities, coupled with decades of rich industry experience, make the company a powerful player in the point-of-sale (POS) industry. Following Diebold's acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf in 2016, the combined entity continues to grow impressively in both the United States and Europe.
"Few companies in the SCO market have been able to balance business and product strategies to match customer expectations across retailer categories and geographies," said Frost & Sullivan Industry Analyst Aravindh Vanchesan. "Through its unique value proposition in terms of cost-effective and innovative self-service technology, Diebold Nixdorf is transforming retail and rejuvenating its own growth trajectory."
Outstanding features of Diebold Nixdorf's industry-leading self-checkout and BEETLE product lines include:

Modular and scalable systems enabling customization, easy POS integration, user-friendly interfaces, and a compact footprint
Consulting as an incremental asset to raise efficiency of the checkout zone
Lowest TCO that appeals to all categories of retailers
Innovations that enhance the value proposition by adding short- and long-term revenue streams, establishing customer loyalty
Strong technical support and maintenance services to effectively implement best practices and manage an SCO project from concept to deployment
Diebold Nixdorf focuses on quality rather than quantity, maintaining a price advantage in an otherwise competitive market. As a result of its healthy sales relationships with not only its retail customers but also mobility, security, and segment-specific software providers, Diebold Nixdorf has built a brand name associated with quality, reliability, and security.
Above all, Diebold Nixdorf's end-to-end game-changing technologies and services have helped its growth. For instance, the Red Dot Design Award-winning BEETLE /iSCAN EASY self-checkout portfolio enables consumers to scan and quickly pay for items using cards, mobile wallets, or near-field communication (NFC)-enabled smartphones. At this year's NRF show, the company showcased a new terminal that is less than 10 inches wide, features a highly secure EMV chip reader, and can be used as an ATM, POS terminal, and an SCO unit. Its TPiSHOP application allows retailers to offer smartphone-enabled shopping in-store and from customers' homes.
In a market with limited number of turnkey solution providers, Diebold Nixdorf dominates due to its global presence; it has more than 14,500 field service engineers operating in over 130 countries.

Diebold Nixdorf Revises Earnings Guidance for the Full Year 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Second Quarter of 2017
Jul 5 17
Diebold Nixdorf revised earnings guidance for the full year 2017. The company now expects revenue between $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion, down from previously $5 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are now expected to be between $0.95 and $1.15 per share, down from the prior range between $1.40 and $1.70. The GAAP loss is seen between $1.45 and $1.65, wider than the prior range of a loss between $0.65 and $0.95. Net loss attributable to the company is now expected to be $125 million to $110 million compared to the previous guidance range of $75 million to $50 million. Adjusted EBITDA $360 million to $380 million compared to the previous guidance range of $440 million to $470 million. The company expects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 30% for the full year. As previously disclosed, the company's banking business is increasingly made up of large, complex projects with higher software content, resulting in a longer customer decision-making process and order-to-revenue conversion cycle. As a result, the timing and volume of orders to date leads the company to adjust its 2017 guidance.

For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects revenue and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the first quarter of 2017.

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]

Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

History[edit]
Diebold Safe & Lock Company to Diebold, Incorporated (1859-1960s)[edit]




Pictured is the body of a scout car, manufactured by Diebold, being installed at a Diebold plant in Canton, Ohio in 1941.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

Diebold Nixdorf (pronounced "DEE-bold NIX-dorf") is an American financial self-service, security and services corporation[4] internationally engaged primarily in the sale, manufacture, installation and service of self-service transaction systems (such as ATMs), electronic and physical security products (including vaults and currency processing systems), software and related services for global financial and commercial markets.[5] Founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company,[7] after becoming incorporated in Ohio in 1876[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Currently headquartered in the Akron-Canton area with facilities in nearby Green,[9][10] in 1921 Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold has since branched into diverse markets, and is currently the largest provider of ATMs in the United States.[5][11] With 2015 revenues of US$2.42 billion,[1] Diebold Nixdorf was founded when Diebold Inc. merged with Germany's Wincor Nixdorf in 2016.[3] It is estimated that Diebold Nixdorf controls about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12]

Diebold was founded in 1859[6] in Cincinnati, Ohio as the Diebold Bahmann Safe Company.[7] Under the leadership of founder Charles Diebold, a German immigrant,[13] the company's 250 initial employees[14] began manufacturing safes and bank vaults[13] out of a factory in Canton, Ohio.[14] Diebold states that 878 of its safes protected some of the only undamaged property in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,[7] and the following year Diebold moved its operations and headquarters to Canton to meet increased demand.[7] In 1874, Diebod was contracted to build the word's largest safe, to be installed in the San Francisco branch[15] of Wells Fargo.[8] In 1876, after becoming incorporated in Ohio,[8] the company changed its name to Diebold Safe & Lock Company.[7] Diebold secured its first international sale in 1881, when it built a safe for the President of Mexico.[7] Diebold debuted manganese steel doors marketed as TNT-proof in 1890,[8] and in 1921, Diebold sold the world's largest commercial bank vault to Detroit National Bank.[8] Diebold became a publicly traded company in the 1930s.[7] Also around that time, Diebold introduced a "robbery-deterrent system for banks that flooded the bank lobby with tear gas" to help deal with robbers such as the infamous John Dillinger.[7]
In 1936, Diebold expanded its product lines by acquiring companies specializing in products such as paper-based filing systems,[7] and it began developing armor plate for military tanks that year.[13] Between 1939 and 1945, Diebold devoted 98 percent of its activities to the war effort. Among other projects, during World War II Diebold employed around 2,900 workers and "sold $65 million in armor plate for more than 36,000 U.S. Army scout cars," particularly the M2 Scout car model.[7] In 1943, Diebold Safe & Lock Company changed its name to Diebold, Incorporated, in an effort to reflect the company's increasing diversification of products.[13] The prohibition agent Eliot Ness was on the Diebold board from 1944 until 1951,[7] and in 1952 Raymond Koontz was named Diebold's president, after first joining Diebold as an assistant to the president in 1947.[16] Diebold earned a net income of $1.7 million in 1959.[7]

On April 27, 1964, Diebold went public on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NYSE: DBD.[7] In 1965 Diebold began offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to diverse institutions including banks and post offices.[13][7] Still involved in safes and vaults, in 1968 the First National Bank of Chicago purchased the world's largest double vault doors from Diebold.[8] Diebold subsequently began offering computer-controlled security and surveillance systems in 1970.[13]
Between the early 1950s and the late 1970s, Diebold's annual revenue increased from USD$229 million to $451 million.[16]. These results were in no small measure the consequence of the successful strategies by Diebold's president Raymond Koontz. In the early 1970s, Koontz began pushing the company into the then emerging market for automated teller machines.[16] This drive was evident as early as 1966, when Richard Glyer demonstrated a Diebold cash machine prototype at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association in San Francisco, CA.[17] Then in July 1970, Daniel Maggin, Chairman of the Board, accompanied Koontz to England with the specific purpose of meeting (without prior notice) with Chubb’s Managing Director, William E. Randall. Diebold wanted exclusivity to distribute Chubb’s cash machines throughout the USA.[18]
The Chubb units, however, were found somewhat disappointing by the US market.[19] After repeated failures and a limited availability of spare parts and service engineers, Diebold's staff and customers thought the Chubb devices did not meet their service expectations. Not surprisingly Diebold finally stopped distributing Chubb devices in 1973 and at the same time, decided to develop and eventually launch its own Total Automatic Banking System (TABS) 500. This device was developed by Robert W. Clark, Phillip C. Dolsen and Donald E. Kinker, and first installed in 1974.
Diebold's Event (alarm) Monitoring Center opened in 1985, allowing Diebold to monitor its "ATMs, kiosks, facilities and operations" full-time from a singular facility.[7] Robert Mahoney was appointed company CEO in 1985.[20] Koontz retired as chairman in 1988, although he continued to serve on the board.[16] In 1989, Diebold shipped 12 percent of the world's ATMs sold worldwide.[21] Diebold partnered with IBM on InterBold in 1990, a joint venture chiefly formed to provide self-service products for the financial industry. Under the terms of the joint venture, Diebold marketed their combined ATM lines in the US, while IBM marketed them abroad.[22] By September 1995, Diebold was making over half of the ATMs used in the United States.[16] In 1996, Diebold generated USD$1 billion in revenue as a company for the first time in a single year.[7] The InterBold partnership was dissolved on January 19, 1998 when Diebold purchased IBM's share of the partnership for $16.1 million.[22]
International growth (1998-2001)[edit]
In the 1990s the company significantly diversified its products, and by 1998 was offering "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions."[6] Under Diebold chairman and CEO Robert Mahoney,[23] Diebold debuted an ATM in 1999 that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Also that year, Diebold introduced the first talking ATM in the United States.[25] In October 1999, Diebold acquired all the stock of Procomp Amazonia Industria Electronica, S.A, a manufacturer of retail and banking automation equipment such as ATMs based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.[23]
The U.S. National Archives in Washington, D.C. hired Diebold in 2001 to secure documents such as the Charters of Freedom, The Constitution, The Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence.[7] In February 2002, Diebold announced it would acquire the financial self-service assets of the European companies Getronics NV and Groupe Bull for approximately USD $160 million.[26] The agreement put Diebold near "$2 billion in revenue on an annualized basis."[26] By the end of 2002, Diebold had 13,000 associates and serviced 88 countries. The company also continued to secure historical items such as the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution.[24] Seeking to expand in India,[27] at the end of 2002, Diebold announced a new production unit in Goa manufacturing ATMs in collaboration with Tata Infotec, and soon after announced a new corporate office in Mumbai.[27] Revenue in 2003 was $2.1 billion for Diebold overall, with stock up 36% for the year.[28]
Diebold Election Systems and UTC (2002-2009)[edit]
See also: Premier Election Solutions
In 2002, Diebold entered the United States elections industry through the acquisition of Global Election Systems, a producer of touch-screen voting technology based in McKinney, Texas. Branded Diebold Election Systems (DES), the acquisition was their smallest business segment,[29] and in late 2002, 3.7 million voters in Georgia used DES touch-screen stations.[24] DES was soon the subject of controversy amid allegations surrounding the security and reliability of some of its products,[30] as well as the political fundraising activities of Diebold’s then-CEO Walden O'Dell in 2003. Critics argued O'Dell had a political conflict of interest which could compromise the security of Diebold's ballots,[28] which O'Dell denied.[31] Shortly afterwards, Diebold forbade its top executives from making political donations.[32] Citing personal reasons,[33] O'Dell resigned in December 2005[34] after several consecutive quarters of poor performance,[33] with his role taken by Tom Swidarski.[35] In August 2007, DES rebranded itself as Premier Election Solutions,[36][37][29] and two years later the division was sold to a competitor, Election Systems & Software.[38]
Wired Magazine reported in 2007 that an editor using a Diebold IP address had removed negative information from the Diebold Wikipedia page, with the information later moved to a more appropriate location.[39] Diebold was increasingly focusing on technology related to mobile banking as of 2008,[40] incorporating mobile banking into many of its products. That year Diebold was selected to be the sole ATM provider at certain Beijing Olympics venues.[7] In March 2008, United Technologies Corporation (UTC), a large engineering and defense conglomerate, announced it had made a $2.63 billion bid to buy Diebold, which was later rejected as too low.[5] In October 2008, UTC announced it was breaking off acquisition talks after Diebold rejected the offer.[41] The company had 17,000 workers worldwide by April 2009.[14] In 2009 Bank Technology News ranked Diebold as No. 1 on its FINTECH 100 list of ATM providers.[7]
New facilities and acquisitions (2010-2013)[edit]
After a lawsuit brought by the SEC alleging deceptive accounting between 2002 and 2007, several Diebold executives paid settlements in June 2010 to have the charges dropped, without admitting any liability. Other executives refused to settle.[42] By 2011, Diebold was the largest manufacturer of ATMs in the United States. The company debuted a prototype of the first virtualized ATM that year, which was created jointly with VMware and used cloud technology.[11] In 2011, Diebold was hired to implement "advanced security solutions" at the World Trade Center Transportation Hub.[7] Also that year, SDM Magazine named Diebold its 2011 Systems Integrator of the Year.[7] In 2012, Diebold debuted what it claims is the "world's first 4G LTE-enabled ATM concept,"[7] as well as "two-way concierge video services" to its ATMs.[7] After acquiring around 4,400 ATMs from Toronto-Dominion Bank in 2012,[35] in September 2012, Diebold acquired the Brazilian online banking company Gas Tecnologia, which protects around 70% of the internet banking transactions in Brazil.[35] On October 25, 2012, the company announced it was suspending plans to build a new world headquarters in Green, Ohio, saying it was no longer economically feasible.[43]
CEO and President Thomas Swidarski resigned in January 2013 after pressure from the board over poor financial performance. Henry D.G. Wallace, a former CFO for Ford, assumed oversight of Diebold until a new CEO could be selected.[35] Andy W. Mattes, a former Hewlett-Packard and Siemens executive, was appointed Diebold's new president and CEO in June 2013.[44] Diebold debuted new ATM models in 2013,[7] and also "increased its cash dividend for the 60th consecutive year."[7] In 2013, Diebold was charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, after international division leaders and Diebold agents were alleged to have provided "improper gifts" to officials overseas. The Justice Department agreed to drop the charges if Diebold complied with various terms, including 18 months of compliance monitoring and a $48 million settlement.[45]
Recent years and Wincor Nixdorf merger (2014-2016)[edit]
See also: Diebold Nixdorf
Diebold announced that it was buying the Danish PIN pad maker Cryptera in June 2014. Under the agreement, Cryptera remained a separate business operating under Diebold, and also remained an "original equipment manufacturer of EPP devices for Diebold and other existing customers."[46] In July 2014, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader, which it claims "prevents all known forms of skimming [ATM crime]."[47] Diebold's revenue in 2014 equaled US$3.05 billion, an increase from the year before.[2] Operating income equaled $117.0 million, net income equaled $114.4 million, and assets totaled $2.34 billion.[2] As of 2014,[48] Diebold held the record for consecutive dividend increases in its stock value.[49]
In March 2015, Diebold acquired the Canadian ATM software company Phoenix Interactive Design.[50] Based in London, Ontario, Phoenix was known for working with clients such as TD Canada Trust and Fifth Third Bank.[50] Diebold sold the North American aspects of its electronic security business to Securitas in October 2015. Based in Stockholm, Securitas purchased the assets for USD$350 million.[51] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts.[51] The first model, Irving, allows customers to withdraw money with an iris scan instead of a card,[52] while the second concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as "a dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time."[52]
In June 2015, Diebold was reportedly in talks to acquire its German rival Wincor Nixdorf.[53] with the new company to be named Diebold Nixdorf.[54] On November 23, 2015, Diebold Incorporated and Wincor Nixdorf AG entered into a business combination agreement, with Diebold offering $1.8 billion in cash and shares to finance the merger. Combined, it was estimated that the two companies would control about 35 percent of the global ATM market.[12] The combined company would have registered offices in North Canton, Ohio, and be operated from headquarters in North Canton and Wincor Nixdorf's facilities in Paderborn, Germany.[54] Software development for the new company would take place in North America, with Diebold citing their Phoenix Interactive Design subdivision based in Ontario, Canada.[54] Diebold announced it had satisfied the share tender condition to acquire Wincor Nixdorf on March 24, 2016.[3] On August 15, 2016, it was announced that the merger had been completed, with Diebold Nixdorf beginning operations under the name Diebold Nixdorf on August 16.[55]
Markets and services[edit]
Diebold markets its products and services in diverse industries, including the financial, commercial, and retail spheres.[56] Diebold is split into four regional divisions including North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific. The Middle East, Europe, and Africa divisions operate as one segment.[56]
Beyond designing and producing its own physical product lines, according to Bloomberg Diebold provides services involving "installation and ongoing maintenance of products, remote services, availability management, branch automation, and distribution channel consulting; and outsourced and managed services, such as remote monitoring, troubleshooting, transaction processing, currency management, maintenance services, and online communication services."[56] The company also engages in project analysis for clients, as well as systems integration and architectural engineering.[56]
Products[edit]
Diebold is known for designing, manufacturing, and servicing numerous product lines related to security and automated service. By 1998, the company offered "automated teller machines, electronic and physical security equipment, automated medication dispensing systems, software, supplies and integrated systems solutions," among other products and services.[6]
Safes and metal work[edit]




This large 24-bolt Diebold vault door at the Winona National Bank was built in the early 1900s.


Diebold was founded in 1859[6] as a manufacturer of safes and bank vaults,[13] and bank safes and vaults would prove a staple of the company for many decades.[14]
Automated dispensors[edit]
Over the years Diebold has developed a number of products involved with automated dispensation, for example automated teller machines,[6] movie vending machines, airline ticket vending machines, and credit-card activated gas pumps.[14] In 1965 Diebold began "offering pneumatic tube delivery systems to banks, hospitals, post offices, libraries, office buildings" and many other industrial facilities.[13][7] In the mid-1990s Diebold created its MedSelect Systems division, which introduced an automated drug dispensing system in 1995.[8]
Security measures[edit]
Diebold has developed a number of physical and electronic security products,[56] and in recent years has been contracted to protect the World Trade Center Transportation Hub,[7] the Hope Diamond at the Smithsonian Institution,[24] and the United States Constitution, among other notable artifacts and landmarks.[7] The company no longer engages in specialized physical security projects, and has since sold its North America-based electronic security business in October 2015.[51]
For ATM security, Diebold introduced its ActivEdge card reader in 2014, which it describes as "the industry's first complete anti-skimming card reader prevents all known forms of skimming – the most prevalent type of ATM crime – as well as other forms of ATM fraud."[47]
Automated teller machines[edit]

Diebold branched into the emerging market for automated teller machines (ATMs) in the early 1970s, and has since debuted numerous ATM product lines.[16] Diebold's Total Automatic Banking System 500 (TABS 500) product was revealed in 1972.[7] Another early ATM created by Diebold was the Diebold 10xx, introduced in 1985 as part of the 10xx series.[57] InterBold, the ATM sales and marketing arm of Diebold, introduced a number of ATMs in the early 1990s.[22] In 1999, Diebold debuted an ATM that identified customers using iris recognition,[7] which was the first of its kind.[7][24] Diebold also introduced the first talking ATM in the United States that year, which was installed on October 1, 1999 in San Francisco’s City Hall.[25]
In July 2002 Diebold introduced its 3030 Bulk Cash Recycler Model (BCRM),[58] and in 2003, Diebold launched its Opteva line of ATMs.[7]
On December 8, 2014, Diebold debuted the 3500 and 3700 ATM series, both of which handle cash recycling among other functions.[59] On October 25, 2015, Diebold publicly debuted two new ATM concepts at the Las Vegas Money20/20 show.[51] The first model Irving, which was undergoing testing by Citigroup at the time, allows customers to withdraw money with a iris scan, removing the need for a card.[52] The second ATM concept, titled Janus, was described by Fortune as a "dual-sided, self-service ATM that can serve two customers at the same time," with videoconferencing also available for help with complex transactions.[52]
Diebold Foundation[edit]
The philanthropic arm of Diebold, Inc., The Diebold Foundation, has supported a number of non-profits, including local branches of Meals on Wheels,[60] as well as the Group Plan Commission to support the redevelopment of Cleveland’s Public Square.[61]

 SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Based on its recent analysis of the self-checkout (SCO) systems market, Frost & Sullivan recognizes Diebold Nixdorf with the 2017 Global Frost & Sullivan Award for Growth Excellence Leadership. Compelling product innovation capabilities, coupled with decades of rich industry experience, make the company a powerful player in the point-of-sale (POS) industry. Following Diebold's acquisition of Wincor Nixdorf in 2016, the combined entity continues to grow impressively in both the United States and Europe.    "Few companies in the SCO market have been able to balance business and product strategies to match customer expectations across retailer categories and geographies," said Frost & Sullivan Industry Analyst Aravindh Vanchesan. "Through its unique value proposition in terms of cost-effective and innovative self-service technology, Diebold Nixdorf is transforming retail and rejuvenating its own growth trajectory." Outstanding features of Diebold Nixdorf's industry-leading self-checkout and BEETLE product lines include:  Modular and scalable systems enabling customization, easy POS integration, user-friendly interfaces, and a compact footprint Consulting as an incremental asset to raise efficiency of the checkout zone Lowest TCO that appeals to all categories of retailers Innovations that enhance the value proposition by adding short- and long-term revenue streams, establishing customer loyalty Strong technical support and maintenance services to effectively implement best practices and manage an SCO project from concept to deployment As a result of its healthy sales relationships with not only its retail customers but also mobility, security, and segment-specific software providers, Diebold Nixdorf has built a brand name associated with quality, reliability, and security. Above all, Diebold Nixdorf's end-to-end game-changing technologies and services have helped its growth. For instance, the Red Dot Design Award-winning BEETLE /iSCAN EASY self-checkout portfolio enables consumers to scan and quickly pay for items using cards, mobile wallets, or near-field communication (NFC)-enabled smartphones. At this year's NRF show, the company showcased a new terminal that is less than 10 inches wide, features a highly secure EMV chip reader, and can be used as an ATM, POS terminal, and an SCO unit. Its TPiSHOP application allows retailers to offer smartphone-enabled shopping in-store and from customers' homes. In a market with limited number of turnkey solution providers, Diebold Nixdorf dominates due to its global presence; it has more than 14,500 field service engineers operating in over 130 countries. In recognition of its continued growth leadership, Frost & Sullivan recognizes Diebold Nixdorf with the 2017 Growth Excellence Leadership Award. Each year, Frost & Sullivan presents this award to the company that has demonstrated excellence in growth and customer value.

About Diebold Nixdorf, Incorporated

Cash never gets old at Diebold. The company is a leading global
producer of automated teller machines (ATMs). In addition, it
offers remote teller systems, cash dispensers, and check cashing
machines. Originally a manufacturer of safes, the company is still
active in its original market, offering products that include
vaults and security systems for financial institutions. It also
provides electronic voting machines in Brazil. The company's
related services range from traditional maintenance to remote
monitoring, transaction processing, and currency management.
Diebold, which has operations in more than 90 countries, gets more
than half of sales outside North America. In a major move, Diebold
bought its European rival Wincor Nixdorf for $1.8 billion.
Operations
The company's largest product segment, financial self-service
(FSS), includes ATMs and other financial machines and accounts for
87% of revenue. The security segment (electronic security systems
and products) accounts for 12% of sales and the contribution of
election and lottery systems dropped to 1%.
Geographic ReachNorth America (primarily the US) is Ohio-based
Diebold's largest market, accounting for 45% of the company's
sales. Latin America (including Brazil) brings in 20% of its
revenue, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 1% and Europe,
Middle East, and Africa at 17%.
Financial Performance
Diebold's sales fell 12% to 7% to $2.4 billion in 2015 from $3
billion 2014. Revenue dropped in all business segments and all
geographies regions but the US where sale were flat. Overseas,
Diebold felt the impact of a strong dollar with currency exchange
rates working against it. The significant 32% droip in Latin
America sales were blamed on the weakening of the Brazil real and
other economic problems in Brazil. The company attributed a 12%
drop in Asia-Pacific sales on the move in China -- at the
government's behest -- to use of domestic ATM suppliers.
The company's profit slid some 36% to about $74 million in 2015
from $114 million in 2014. The lower revenue did its part, but
Diebold also had higher costs in 2015, including some related to
acquisitions.
Diebold had to use more of its cash flow toward operations in
2015 finishing the year with $31 million, compared to $189 million
in 2014. Cash flow was affected by less income from continuing
operations, higher working capital, and reductions in deferred
revenue.
Strategy
Diebold's acquisition (it closed in August 2016) of Wincor
Nixdorf doubles revenue to more than $5 billion. The deal opens
Europe to Diebold and, on the other hand, opens the US to Wincor
Nixdorf products. Diebold positioned the merger as a match between
companies with strong services and software components, areas that
Diebold is emphasizing as it changes its business model from a
hardware orientation to one focused on software.
In 2017 Diebold sold its operations in the UK and Ireland
to Cennox Ltd., a privately held ATM maker based in the UK. The
sale was required by UK regulators as part of the deal for Wincor
Nixdorf,which also had operations in the UK and Ireland.
Diebold also continues to implement its Diebold 2.0 turnaround
program that it started n 2013. Its aim is to transform Diebold
into a world-class, services-led and software enabled provider of
secure, convenient, and efficient products to customers. The four
key elements of Diebold 2.0 include: reducing costs and improving
near-term delivery and execution; generating increased cash flow;
recruiting and retaining top talent to drive innovation and execute
its transformation; return the company to sustainable, profitable
growth.
Diebold's growth strategy is focused largely on providing
software-oriented services; the company now generates more than 55%
of its revenue from services supporting its product lines. In 2015,
the moved to consolidate it business in Brazil and the rest of
Latin America, which has been run separately. The new structure is
to improve operational efficiency and improve customer service.
While the company's experience in Brazil has been bumpy recently,
it did capture a contract with one of the country's biggest
banks.
Mergers and Acquisitions
In 2015, Diebold acquired Phoenix Interactive Design, a software
developer for ATMs and other financial self-service applications.
The purchase is to accelerate Dieobld's growth in managed services
and branch automation. In 2014, Diebold acquired Cryptera, a
supplier of Diebold's encrypting PIN pad technology.
