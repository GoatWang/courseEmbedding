Mr. Shapiro’s engaged ownership approach has been effective in directly creating and unlocking shareholder value in Lawndale’s portfolio companies and has contributed to Lawndale’s activist funds often being ranked among the top event-driven and small-cap value funds in peer databases for long-term performance. In addition to leading Lawndale, Mr. Shapiro has also served as a Director or Observer on portfolio company boards and debt and equity bankruptcy committees. Mr. Shapiro is a member of the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) and, via Lawndale, has been a long-time Sustaining Member of the Council of Institutional Investors (CII).Mr. Shapiro has more than two decades of portfolio management and analytically varied experience from a number of buy-side positions, employing a rare combination of credit, legal, equity and workout skills. Prior to founding the Lawndale organization in 1992, Mr. Shapiro managed the workout and restructuring of large portfolios of high-yield bonds, distressed equities and risk arbitrage securities for the Belzberg family's entity, First City Capital. Before joining First City, Mr. Shapiro was involved in numerous corporate acquisition and recapitalization transactions for both Manufacturers Hanover Trust and the Spectrum Group, a private equity firm. Mr. Shapiro received dual JD and MBA degrees from UCLA, where he was an Olin Fellow at the UCLA School of Law and a Venture Capital Fellow at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, and a BS in Business Administration from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, where he periodically guest lectures.Mr. Shapiro was selected to the 2012 NACD Directorship 100, a list of the most influential leaders in the boardroom and corporate governance community. He is often quoted on matters of corporate governance, fiduciary duty and activist investing and has been the subject of several articles, including a Business Week article calling him “The Gary Cooper of Governance”. Mr. Shapiro has been a frequent speaker/panelist on corporate governance and activist investing issues for the Council of Institutional Investors, National Association of Corporate Directors, Society of Corporate Governance, SEC Advisory Committee on Small Public Companies, and the Director’s education programs of Stanford Law School, UCLA Anderson, the Wisconsin Business School and Yale’s Millstein Center for Corporate Governance, among others. Mr. Shapiro is a Contributing Author to Seeking Alpha.Mr. Shapiro started Lawndale’s funds in 1993 with only $188,000 under management and through performance and added capital has grown the firm’s managed assets substantially. Lawndale applies a private equity approach through active and relational ownership of public company securities. In most investments, Lawndale plays a constructive relational role by actively working with boards and management teams to help them achieve their strategic and operating goals. In other instances, Lawndale is a direct value-unlocking catalyst, utilizing a range of tools that include aggressively promoting improvements in a company's governance and operational structures, proxy actions, asserting shareowner’s legal rights and taking active roles in restructuring and buyout proposal negotiations..Chad Brown, CFA, Contributorlong/short equity, CFA109Following15FollowersAlthough retired from active trading, I am still interested in tracking markets and stocks. I am working on a book about ways to do fundamental research for people like Seeking Alpha readers; I seek reader feedback. The industry I am the most familiar with is Paper and Packaging. I worked on the Buy Side (Investors) and Sell Side (Broker/Dealers and research publishers) for over 30 years. Sell side employers included Kidder Peabody, Drexel Burnham Lambert, BZW, Merrill Lynch, Bank of Montreal. Buy side firms included Citibank, John A. Levin, and Xylem Global Partners. Xylem Global Partners, where I managed $100+ million in assets, was a market-neutral sector fund specialized in paper, forest products, packaging, building materials, and related industries. I have also researched stocks in a number of other industries. I have applied for tuition refunds from Stanford Graduate School of Business, which taught me Efficient Market Theory, now disproven, and Harvard College, which taught me Behaviorism, a now-discredited school of Psychology.

CFA CharterholderFavorite Quotes aka 'Bull Market Sanity Checks'"It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who's been swimming naked." - Warren Buffett“The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing” - Phil Fisher"It takes character to sit there with all that cash and do nothing. I didn’t get to where I am by going after mediocre opportunities." - Charlie Munger"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" - George Santayana“If you want to shoot rare, fast-moving elephants, you should always carry a loaded gun." - Warren Buffett"Doing what everyone else is doing at the moment, and therefore what you have an almost irresistible urge to do, is often the wrong thing to do at all." - Phil Fisher“It is impossible to produce superior performance unless you do something different from the majority.” - John Templeton"The single greatest edge an investor can have is a long-term orientation." - Seth Klarman“In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine.” - Ben Graham"In the world of investing, being correct about something isn't at all synonymous with being proved correct right away." - Howard Marks"I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.” - Warren Buffett“Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.” - John Templeton"If it’s close, we don’t play.” - Ben Graham“There can be considerable opportunity as the perception of value pivots from the balance sheet to the income statement.” - J. Carlo Cannell"Money is made in the dark, not in the light of day. Rejoice in the gloom and fear and consider adding to your investment.” - J. Carlo Cannell"Our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not to keep up with every damn thing in the world." - Charlie Munger"To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage, but provides the greatest profit." - John Templeton"Just because you buy a stock and it goes up does not mean you are right. Just because you buy a stock and it goes down does not mean you are wrong." - Peter Lynch"Individuals who cannot master their emotions are ill-suited to profit from the investment process." - Ben Graham"It just seems logical that sticking to investing in only a small number of companies that you understand well, rather than moving down the list to your thirtieth or fiftieth favorite pick, would create a much greater potential to earn above-average investment returns." - Joel Greenblatt"The most realistic distinction between the investor and the speculator is found in their attitude toward stock-market movements. The speculator's primary interest lies in anticipating and profiting from market fluctuations. The investor's primary interest lies in acquiring and holding suitable securities at suitable prices. Market movements are important to him in a practical sense, because they alternately create low price levels at which he would be wise to buy and high price levels at which he certainly should refrain from buying and probably would be wise to sell." - Ben GrahamFavorite Books (abridged list):"Margin of Safety: Risk-Averse Value Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor" [out of print] - Seth Klarman"Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks & Fraud in Financial Reports" - Howard Schilit"The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing" - Benjamin Graham"The Most Important Thing: Uncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor" - Howard Marks"Value Investing: From Graham to Buffett And Beyond" - Bruce Greenwald2010 CFA Level 2 - Book 2 "Financial Statement Analysis" ... just kidding.mwhiseFull-time Investor, Developed International Markets, Dividend stock ideas & income5Following0FollowersNo information availableRgargaFinancial advisor1562Following19FollowersConsider myself a value investor and cashflow is king.Ross O'Toole, CFA, Contributorlong/short equity, value, special situations, contrarian31Following59FollowersNo information availableSeeking Investor Viewsvalue, special situations, event-driven, long-term horizon1Following1FollowersAs an experienced investor, what interests me most is how other investors view the intrinsic value of a company, or an opportunity to enhance that value.
