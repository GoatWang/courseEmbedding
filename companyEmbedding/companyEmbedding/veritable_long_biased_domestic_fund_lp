History[edit]
In 1992, Wu Shangzhi, then Senior Investment Officer at the World Bank Group's Direct Investment Division, decided to establish an investment firm in China. He approached GIC with a fund raising proposal. Instead of considering an equity commitment, GIC suggested Wu to join China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank that GIC was involved in the preparatory work related to the firm's establishment at that point. Wu led the direct investment business at China International Capital Corporation until it was split off by the firm in 2001, when China Securities Regulatory Commission prohibited investment bank from doing private equity investment.[9]
In 2002, CDH was established with six founding partners including Wu Shangzhi and Jiao Zhen, who had worked together at China International Capital Corporation's Direct Investment Division since 1995. Other shareholders include GIC, China National Investment & Guaranty Co Ltd, and Capital Z Partners.[10] CDH have kept all the six founding partners within the firm to this day,[5] despite famously losing its head of venture capital, Wang Gongquan, who ran away with his mistress.[11][12]
In 2003, CDH raised only $102 million for its first standalone fund, but quickly found its way into a series of successful China deals, including stakes in sportswear company Li-Ning, display advertising firm Focus Media and Mengniu Dairy. That first fund returned around 3.5 times its investors' money, according to data seen by Reuters, making it one of the top performing funds in China, and enabling it to raise capital for a series of bigger funds.[11]
In 2006, CDH and Goldman Sachs invested $256 million in a controlling stake in a struggling meat producer, then known as Shuanghui Group, along with Temasek and New Horizon Capital.[13] That buyout deal, one of the first of its kind in China, sparked controversy as opponents claimed the country was selling assets too cheaply to foreign investors. Goldman sold half its stake back to CDH in 2009 for five times what it originally paid.[14]
CDH's performance attracted large institutional investors into its funds, including California Public Employees' Retirement System and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 75 percent of CDH's private equity funds now come from international investors.[11] With a target cap at $2 billion, CDH's fifth USD PE fund was closed at a hard cap of $2.5 billion due to over-subscription.[15]
Business and affiliates[edit]
CDH's family of funds includes private equity, venture capital, real estate, mezzanine and credit products.
Private Equity[edit]
CDH manages five USD-denominated funds and two RMB-denominated funds, with cumulative assets under management in excess of USD 15 billion.

Cephei Capital was founded in 2006 with the support from CDH. Cephei focuses on investing in Chinese companies in the secondary market. Cephei now manages separate accounts for a number of Qualified Foreign Investment Institutions (QFII) in the China A-share market. At the same time, Cephei also manages a variety of long-biased public equity funds and collectively manages more than USD 1.5 billion in assets.

History[edit]
In 1992, Wu Shangzhi, then Senior Investment Officer at the World Bank Group's Direct Investment Division, decided to establish an investment firm in China. He approached GIC with a fund raising proposal. Instead of considering an equity commitment, GIC suggested Wu to join China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank that GIC was involved in the preparatory work related to the firm's establishment at that point. Wu led the direct investment business at China International Capital Corporation until it was split off by the firm in 2001, when China Securities Regulatory Commission prohibited investment bank from doing private equity investment.[9]
In 2002, CDH was established with six founding partners including Wu Shangzhi and Jiao Zhen, who had worked together at China International Capital Corporation's Direct Investment Division since 1995. Other shareholders include GIC, China National Investment & Guaranty Co Ltd, and Capital Z Partners.[10] CDH have kept all the six founding partners within the firm to this day,[5] despite famously losing its head of venture capital, Wang Gongquan, who ran away with his mistress.[11][12]
In 2003, CDH raised only $102 million for its first standalone fund, but quickly found its way into a series of successful China deals, including stakes in sportswear company Li-Ning, display advertising firm Focus Media and Mengniu Dairy. That first fund returned around 3.5 times its investors' money, according to data seen by Reuters, making it one of the top performing funds in China, and enabling it to raise capital for a series of bigger funds.[11]
In 2006, CDH and Goldman Sachs invested $256 million in a controlling stake in a struggling meat producer, then known as Shuanghui Group, along with Temasek and New Horizon Capital.[13] That buyout deal, one of the first of its kind in China, sparked controversy as opponents claimed the country was selling assets too cheaply to foreign investors. Goldman sold half its stake back to CDH in 2009 for five times what it originally paid.[14]
CDH's performance attracted large institutional investors into its funds, including California Public Employees' Retirement System and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 75 percent of CDH's private equity funds now come from international investors.[11] With a target cap at $2 billion, CDH's fifth USD PE fund was closed at a hard cap of $2.5 billion due to over-subscription.[15]
Business and affiliates[edit]
CDH's family of funds includes private equity, venture capital, real estate, mezzanine and credit products.
Private Equity[edit]
CDH manages five USD-denominated funds and two RMB-denominated funds, with cumulative assets under management in excess of USD 15 billion.

Cephei Capital was founded in 2006 with the support from CDH. Cephei focuses on investing in Chinese companies in the secondary market. Cephei now manages separate accounts for a number of Qualified Foreign Investment Institutions (QFII) in the China A-share market. At the same time, Cephei also manages a variety of long-biased public equity funds and collectively manages more than USD 1.5 billion in assets.

History[edit]
In 1992, Wu Shangzhi, then Senior Investment Officer at the World Bank Group's Direct Investment Division, decided to establish an investment firm in China. He approached GIC with a fund raising proposal. Instead of considering an equity commitment, GIC suggested Wu to join China International Capital Corporation, an investment bank that GIC was involved in the preparatory work related to the firm's establishment at that point. Wu led the direct investment business at China International Capital Corporation until it was split off by the firm in 2001, when China Securities Regulatory Commission prohibited investment bank from doing private equity investment.[9]
In 2002, CDH was established with six founding partners including Wu Shangzhi and Jiao Zhen, who had worked together at China International Capital Corporation's Direct Investment Division since 1995. Other shareholders include GIC, China National Investment & Guaranty Co Ltd, and Capital Z Partners.[10] CDH have kept all the six founding partners within the firm to this day,[5] despite famously losing its head of venture capital, Wang Gongquan, who ran away with his mistress.[11][12]
In 2003, CDH raised only $102 million for its first standalone fund, but quickly found its way into a series of successful China deals, including stakes in sportswear company Li-Ning, display advertising firm Focus Media and Mengniu Dairy. That first fund returned around 3.5 times its investors' money, according to data seen by Reuters, making it one of the top performing funds in China, and enabling it to raise capital for a series of bigger funds.[11]
In 2006, CDH and Goldman Sachs invested $256 million in a controlling stake in a struggling meat producer, then known as Shuanghui Group, along with Temasek and New Horizon Capital.[13] That buyout deal, one of the first of its kind in China, sparked controversy as opponents claimed the country was selling assets too cheaply to foreign investors. Goldman sold half its stake back to CDH in 2009 for five times what it originally paid.[14]
CDH's performance attracted large institutional investors into its funds, including California Public Employees' Retirement System and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 75 percent of CDH's private equity funds now come from international investors.[11] With a target cap at $2 billion, CDH's fifth USD PE fund was closed at a hard cap of $2.5 billion due to over-subscription.[15]

                Singapore funds up 2% through July, Hong Kong funds down 2.3%
            



                India stocks rally this year as China, Japan markets slump
            



Singapore-based hedge funds outperformed Asian rivals during the first seven months of the year thanks to a greater focus on India and global markets, according to data provider Eurekahedge Pte.Funds headquartered in Singapore returned 2 percent through July, while Hong Kong-based funds declined an average 2.3 percent, Eurekahedge said in a report Tuesday. Funds based in Australia rose 1.9 percent, while Japan-based funds declined 2.5 percent, the report said.While the majority of funds based in Hong Kong and Japan invest in Chinese or Japanese stocks, where markets have posted steep losses this year, Singapore has more funds with a global mandate or an India focus, according to Eurekahedge. Australia-headquartered funds mainly invest in global equity long-short strategies, which didn’t do well until August.








India’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index has rallied 9.4 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent decline in China’s CSI 300 Index and a 15 percent slump in Japan’s Topix index.“Singapore has the most diversified hedge fund industry in Asia with regard to managers’ strategic and regional mandates,” said Mohammad Hassan, head of hedge fund research at Eurekahedge. “Diversification has helped the domestic industry post the best overall gains in Asia, while China and Japan equity-focused centers such as Hong Kong and Japan are in the red.”India FundsIndia-focused funds have returned 7.3 percent through the end of August, according to Eurekahedge, making them the third-best performers globally, behind only Taiwan and Latin America. Funds investing in China lost 1.6 percent and those betting on Japan declined 4.4 percent, the data show.




This year’s ranking reverses a multi-year trend of Hong Kong funds posting the best returns in Asia, the Eurekahedge data show. Funds based in the city have returned 379 percent since the end of 1999, followed by a 354 percent gain by Australian hedge funds. Singapore comes in third at 253 percent, and Japan-based funds lag with a 95 percent return.Among Singapore-based hedge funds investing in India is the Progress India Opportunities Fund, started in December 2014. The $49 million equity fund with a long bias investing in consumer themes returned 13.8 percent this year through the end of August, according to a newsletter obtained by Bloomberg News.




The IPEplus Fund 1, also focused on India and started in 2014 by former 3i Group Plc Asia head Anil Ahuja, returned 2.1 percent through August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The Singapore-based PruLev Global Macro Fund, managed by Norman Tang and August Li and investing mainly in global liquid developed markets, has gained 56 percent through August, according to the fund’s newsletter.By contrast, the Hong Kong-based Springs China Opportunities Fund, a China-focused long-short equity fund, lost 8.7 percent this year through July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Special Situations

OverviewStrategyApproachProcessFund Info









Overview


The Special Situations strategy has an 18-year track record and seeks to generate equity-like returns through a portfolio of debt and equity investments and a low net exposure.


Courage has an extensive track record of opportunistic, contrarian, and deep value investing in credit and equities.  The team's expertise "up and down" the capital structure affords us the ability to structure investments creatively to establish a favorable, asymmetric risk to return profile.








Strategy


The Special Situations strategy draws upon the team's access to a differentiated and robust network of industry, operational, financial, and restructuring professionals to source unique opportunities where we can gain an edge through extensive fundamental research and deep due diligence.


Courage employs an opportunistic, value-driven investment approach focusing on event-driven or special situations that capitalize on complex, misunderstood, or off-the-run opportunities.  Sourcing is derived from:














Distress and bankruptcy
Litigations and investigations
Complex situations




Capital structure dislocations
Out of favor industries, companies, and asset classes
Activism




Private company and industry relationships
Transformative catalysts generating value opportunities
Courage's extensive library of models, deals, and work-outs












Approach
Opportunistic andvalue-biased



We believe the best opportunities often result from irrational markets and emotion surrounding events where the pricing of securities becomes inefficient and deviates from underlying value.  The Special Situations strategy focuses on opportunities and catalysts where we can unlock value.The strategy targets securities of mostly small- and mid-cap U.S. companies and maintains flexibility with regard to investing across a company's capital structure. The Special Situations strategy will invest both long and short and is opportunistic, value-biased, and often contrarian.  We strive to build a differentiated portfolio with a low correlation to the broader markets and other managers.










Process


The strategy employs an iterative process and collaborative approach designed to source, evaluate, and implement investments with a consistent discipline throughout various market environments.













Idea Generation

Courage draws upon its access to a unique network for idea sourcing and timely insight into situations as they develop.
Identify the catalysts which provide the framework for both entry and exit points.
Prioritize ideas:

Meets criteria
Informational edge
Favorable risk/reward
Divergent View






Intensive Research Modeling

Analyze industry and competitive landscape.
Prepare detailed financial model and assess valuation framework.
Collaborate and compose questions for due diligence.
Complete management calls/visits; conduct field research and channel checks; consult with industry contacts.
Ascertain range of possible EVs; emphasize downside risk.





Position Structuring

Examine securities across the entire capital stack; seek best risk/reward tradeoff.
Size positions based on the level of conviction and the magnitude of tail risk.
Require a significant return premium for illiquid positions.





Exposure Profile

Create a concentrated portfolio of long and short idiosyncratic investments.
Continually review catalysts/milestones to track the accuracy of our initial thesis.
Ensure an appropriate liquidity profile of the broader portfolio and limit exposure to highly illiquid positions.





Risk Management


A parallel process at both the position and portfolio level



Balance a bottom-up centric strategy with a top down assessment of overall risk.

The process is intended to concentrate the portfolio on idiosyncratic risk and mitigate unintended beta exposures.

HSBC
– HSBC Total Return Fund (HTRIX):
The Fund seeks to maximize total return by investing in a combination of US dollar-denominated emerging market sovereign, quasi-sovereign* and corporate bonds as well as emerging market local bonds and currencies. The Fund is actively managed and is not benchmark-constrained, allowing the Fund’s portfolio management team flexibility to actively allocate among what they believe is the optimal combination of emerging market assets which may also include equity, equity-linked securities and derivative instruments. The team follows a top-down and fundamentally-driven approach and the portfolio is built without an inherent bias to any particular emerging market asset class.
* The HSBC Total Return Fund defines Quasi-Sovereign companies as those: implicitly or explicitly backed by their country of domicile’s government, or with greater than 50% held by their country of domicile’s government.
– HSBC Global High Income Bond Fund (HBIIX):
This actively managed fund seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with steady income as the largest component. The fund invests in a well-diversified portfolio consisting of three core regional sleeves: US credit, Euro credit and emerging markets (EM). Invests primarily in BBB and BB rated corporate bonds and may invest in securitized debt. We use a customized benchmark to expand and diversify the global opportunity set, improving the fund’s risk return profile.
Federated Investors
Leveraged Company Stock: 
Federated’s Leveraged Company Stock Strategy applies a private equity approach to public stocks by targeting the stocks of leveraged companies. Using a bottom-up, value approach, this concentrated portfolio invests in micro- to mid-cap stocks with strong and stable free-cash-flow characteristics. The strategy is managed within Federated’s high-yield group, as credit and capital structure analysis are key components to its strategy of identifying mispriced stocks and risk management.
Trade Finance Fixed Income: 
Trade Finance offers investors the potential for a source of uncorrelated return, with low volatility and returns that adjust with inflation. It is an asset class that requires specialized expertise including intensive legal and operational due diligence, a deep understanding of risk and how to mitigate it, and relationships with the largest global banks. We believe that as the worldwide demand for trade continues to grow, a diversified pool of trade transactions will consistently deliver the “pure alpha” that investors seek.
Guardian Capital
– Guardian Global Fundamental Equity: 
The investment process is a fundamental, bottom-up stock selection approach which is designed to give exposure to a concentrated portfolio of stocks each of which have significantly better growth and quality characteristics than the market average, but which are not overvalued at the time of purchase. Portfolio construction is index agnostic and aims to provide high active share at all times. Country and sector weightings are driven by stock selection decisions rather than “top down” asset allocation activities.
Guardian Global Dividend Equity: 
Guardian’s global equity investment process employs a systematic approach to finding best-of-breed companies within global sectors. Our proprietary alpha system, called GEMX, compares the rates of change in fundamental factors to detect pockets of strength in global markets. To be rated as a BUY in GEMX, a company must not only exhibit superior fundamentals, but those fundamentals must also be recognized by the market in terms of relative share price performance. In cases where there is a breakdown in the correlation between fundamentals and share price performance, then conviction is low and the company is penalized in our analysis.
Our Global Dividend Equity strategy emphasizes dividend paying securities, yet instead of selecting dividend payers on the basis of yield alone, empirical evidence suggests that focusing on dividend payers that exhibit strong dividend Growth, Payout and Sustainability (GPS) characteristics leads to strong risk adjusted returns, coupled with reduced volatility. Guardian’s unique approach to stock selection is thus focused on selecting names that exhibit strong GPS characteristics, rather than seeking yield for yield’s sake.  Aside from providing yield which acts as a dampening effect on volatility, our dividend strategy has provided strong downside protection during negative market cycles.  Preservation of capital is therefore an important attribute of our strategy which proves beneficial to any endowment/foundation who seeks capital preservation.
The investment style is a combination of yield and growth at a reasonable price. The overall emphasis combines a focus on yield as well as dividend growth.  
Chase Investment Counsel Corporation
Our  Large-Cap Growth Equity product seeks high quality large-cap growth companies that are prudently priced. Starting with a broad universe of stocks, fundamental screens first focus on companies with earnings growth of 10% or more for the past five years and increasing earnings in seven of the past 10 years. A further analysis, using fundamental and technical measures, refines and ranks the universe to a smaller number of stocks. The portfolio holds 30-45 stocks diversified by both sector and industry group. The long-term goal for the large cap portfolio is to provide superior risk adjusted returns over full market cycles.
Our  Mid-Cap Growth Equity product seeks high quality midcap growth companies that are prudently priced in an often overlooked segment of the market. Mid-Cap equities historically have provided small-cap like returns with lower volatility. As with our large cap portfolio we start with a broad universe of stocks. A fundamental screen is used to focus on names with a history of earnings growth of 10% or more for the past five years and increasing earnings in seven of the past 10 years. A further analysis refines the universe to a smaller number of stocks using additional fundamental and technical factors such as positive earnings revision/surprises, strong relative price performance, and improving profitability. The portfolio holds 35-55 stocks diversified by both sector and industry group. The goal for the mid-cap portfolio is also to deliver superior risk adjusted returns over a full market cycle.
Ardsley Partners
– Ardsley Partners Renewable Energy Fund, L.P., launched in July 2006. The primary objective of the Fund is to generate strong returns through a portfolio of long and short public equity investments, regardless of economic conditions within the renewable energy sector and related areas. The fund seeks to identify solutions to the global energy and natural resource problems and invest in companies whose technologies offer alternatives of more efficient use of natural resources. The process combines company specific research, sector analysis and a top-down macroeconomic outlook to identify the best opportunities within each subsector and isolate individual alpha generating shorts across all market capitalization and geographies within the renewable energy sector and related areas. Hands-on, active portfolio management included balancing and shifting sub-sector exposures within the renewable energy universe are at the core of risk management. The Portfolio Manager, Spencer Hempleman, has worked at Ardsley for more than 13 years. Spencer earned his BA at Tufts and MBA at NYU Stern.
– Ardsley Healthcare Fund, L.P., launched in February 2012, is a long/short equity Fund focused on investing in asymmetric risk/reward opportunities across all healthcare sub-sectors and related areas.

Opus Capital
Small Cap Value Plus
Leveraging our experience as Small Cap equity specialists, Opus Capital’s Small Cap Value Plus strategy provides total return and income for investors by focusing on the attractive universe of small cap dividend payers. Historically, these companies have outperformed the broad small cap universe and provided superior downside protection.
Recognizing that simply buying securities with the highest yield is inherently risky, Opus’ philosophy focuses on three key elements:
– Higher dividend yield and growth: We buy only companies with an above-average yield relative to the R2K, which provides meaningful income. We also favor companies that are well-positioned to grow their dividends
– Higher Quality: Simply buying the highest-yielding companies is risky. We buy high-quality companies with sustainable dividends, higher returns on equity and lower debt.
– Lower Valuation: Buying inexpensive companies improves downside protections. Stocks with lower valuations have historically outperformed.
Harbor Funds
Diversified International All Cap Product
The Fund invests primarily in common and preferred stocks of foreign companies, including those in emerging market countries. The portfolio manager focuses on identifying long-term investment opportunities that can arise as a result of certain capital cycle, or supply-side, conditions. Capital cycle investing is based on the concept that the prospect of high returns will attract excessive capital and competition, and vice versa. The portfolio manager uses fundamental, bottom-up qualitative analysis. Research meetings with company management represent the majority of analytical effort conducted. The Fund typically invests in between 250 to 350 companies across Europe, Japan, the Pacific Basin and emerging markets, and North America. While inherently diversified, a bias towards smaller and mid cap businesses in niche industries, coupled with a particularly long holding period, result in a portfolio that is significantly differentiated from the Fund’s benchmark index.
