Product Description

 
An informative guide offering new and innovative ways to think about active management and investing
ActiveBeta Indexes presents exciting new research that shows how above-market returns can be achieved in a low-cost, transparent, and efficient fashion. Active Betas reflect fundamental investment principles that have long been the foundation of active equity returns, but are commonly masqueraded as investment skill, or alpha. This groundbreaking book lifts the veil to uncover the common sources of active returns and reveals their beta-like properties.
Developed by leading investment practitioners at Westpeak Global Advisors, ActiveBeta Indexes introduces Active Beta sources and explains how the behavior of short- and long-term earnings growth gives rise to systematic sources of active equity returns.

Details a new index framework and research findings that could change the face of active portfolio management
Presents patent-pending innovations for constructing style indexes and informationally-efficient active portfolios
Explores the historical performance of ActiveBeta Indexes

Wealth advisers, consultants, pensions and endowments, and other institutional investors will find the intellectual honesty of ActiveBeta Indexes a refreshing perspective on the active management industry. They will also find it a useful guide to a more strategic allocation of their risk and management fee budgets – a growing necessity in these challenging times.

Product Description
Andrew W.Lo – Long-Term Memory in the Stock Market Prices (Article)

 
A test for long-run memory that is robust to short-range dependence is developed. It is a simple extension of Mandelbrot’s “range over standard deviation” or R/S statistic, for which the relevant asymptotic sampling theory is derived via functional central limit theory. This test is applied to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual stock returns indexes over several different time periods. Contrary to previous findings, there is no evidence of long-range dependence in any of the indexes over any sample period or sub-period once short-term autocorrelations are taken into account. Illustrative Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the modified R/S test has power against at least two specific models of long-run memory, suggesting that stochastic models of short-range dependence may adequately capture the time series behavior of stock returns.

The MIT Laboratory for Financial Engineering Healthcare Finance Initiative
In this project, we combine structured finance and portfolio theory to design a new family of "megafunds" to support biomedical innovation. Over the last decade, financial markets have channeled trillions of dollars in investments to the real estate and lending markets. Structured finance facilitated this process by re-engineering loans and receivables into securities offering new profiles of risk and return to investors. We apply these principles to the areas of biomedical innovation and drug development, and propose a new type of megafund that will offer investors a set of attractive securities with unique risk/return profiles while multiplying the resources available for scientific research. The main objectives of the project are:
      •To prove that it is possible to design a structured fund in which investing in science can generate statistically reliable and attractive returns.
      •To detail how a megafund to support biomedical research would need to be structured in order to match researchers’ and investors’ interests.
      •To define the roles that different stakeholders need to play in this market in order to achieve the objectives mentioned above.

Our ultimate goals are to offer a realistic solution to this challenge, to design a new mechanism to raise new pools of funds for science, and to prove that structured finance can play a role in finding answers to some of the problems facing humankind.

                           "For over half a century financial experts have regarded the movements of markets as a random walk - unpredictable meanderings
                              akin to a drunkard's unsteady gait - and this hypothesis has become a cornerstone of modern financial economics and many investment
                              strategies. Here Andrew W. Lo and A. Craig MacKinlay put the Random Walk Hypothesis to the test. In this volume, which elegantly
                              integrates their most important articles, Lo and MacKinlay find that markets are not completely random after all, and that
                              predictable components do exist in recent stock and bond returns. Their book provides a state-of-the-art account of the techniques
                              for detecting predictabilities and evaluating their statistical and economic significance, and offers a tantalizing glimpse
                              into the financial technologies of the future."--Jacket

                           Arguing that hedge funds have very different risk and return characteristics than traditional investments, Lo constructs new
                              tools for analyzing their dynamics, including measures of illiquidity exposure and performance smoothing, linear and nonlinear
                              risk models that capture alternative betas, econometric models of hedge fund failure rates, and integrated investment processes
                              for alternative investments. In two new chapters, he looks at how the strategies for and regulation of hedge funds have changed
                              in the aftermath of the financial crisis."--Pub. desc

                           "In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis, the federal government has pursued significant regulatory reforms, including
                              proposals to measure and monitor systemic risk. However, there is much debate about how this might be accomplished quantitatively
                              and objectively--or whether this is even possible. A key issue is determining the appropriate trade-offs between risk and
                              reward from a policy and social welfare perspective given the potential negative impact of crises. One of the first books
                              to address the challenges of measuring statistical risk from a system-wide persepective, Quantifying Systemic Risk looks at
                              the means of measuring systemic risk and explores alternative approaches. Among the topics discussed are the challenges of
                              tying regulations to specific quantitative measures, the effects of learning and adaptation on the evolution of the market,
                              and the distinction between the shocks that start a crisis and the mechanisms that enable it to grow."--Publisher's website

                           "Half of all Americans have money in the stock market, yet economists can't agree on whether investors and markets are ration
                              and efficient, as modern financial theory assumes, or irrational and inefficient, as behavioral economists believe - and as
                              financial bubbles, crashes, and crises suggest. This is one of the biggest debates in economics, and the value or futility
                              of investment management and financial regulation hang on the outcome. In this groundbreaking book, Andrew Lo cuts through
                              this debate with a new framework, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis, in which rationality and irrationality coexist. Drawing
                              on psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and other fields, "Adaptive Markets" shows that
                              the theory of marked efficiency isn't wrong but merely incomplete. When markets are unstable, investors react instinctively,
                              creating inefficiencies for others to exploit. Lo's new paradigm explains how financial evolution shapes behavior and markets
                              at the speed of thought - a fact revealed by swings between stability and crisis, profit and loss, and innovation and regulation."--Inside

                              Option pricing formulas obtained from continuous-time no- arbitrage arguments such as the Black-Scholes formula generally
                                 do not depend on the drift term of the underlying asset's diffusion equation. However, the drift is essential for properly
                                 implementing such formulas empirically, since the numerical values of the parameters that do appear in the option pricing
                                 formula can depend intimately on the drift. In particular, if the underlying asset's returns are predictable, this will influence
                                 the theoretical value and the empirical estimate of the diffusion coefficient o. We develop an adjustment to the Black-Scholes
                                 formula that accounts for predictability and show that this adjustment can be important even for small levels of predictability,
                                 especially for longer-maturity options. We propose a class of continuous-time linear diffusion processes for asset prices
                                 that can capture a wider variety of predictability, and provide several numerical examples that illustrate their importance

                              Typical value-at-risk (VAR) calculations involve the probabilities of extreme dollar losses, based on the statistical distributions
                                 of market prices. Such quantities do not account for the fact that the same dollar loss can have two very different economic
                                 valuations, depending on business conditions. We propose a nonparametric VAR measure that incorporates economic valuation
                                 according to the state-price density associated with the underlying price processes. The state-price density yields VAR values
                                 that are adjusted for risk aversion, time preferences, and other variations in economic valuation. In the context of a representative
                                 agent equilibrium model, we construct an estimator of the risk-aversion coefficient that is implied by the joint observations
                                 on the cross-section of option prices and time-series of underlying asset values. "

                              This paper examines the stochastic properties of aggregate macroeconomic time series from the standpoint of fractionally integrated
                                 models, and focuses on the persistence of economic shocks. We develop a simple macroeconomic model that exhibits long-term
                                 dependence, a consequence of aggregation in the presence of real business cycles. We derive the relation between properties
                                 of fractionally integrated macroeconomic time series and those of microeconomic data, and discuss how fiscal policy may alter
                                 their stochastic behavior. To implement these results empirically, we employ a test for fractionally integrated time series
                                 based on the Hurst-Mandelbrot rescaled range. This test is robust to short-term dependence, and is applied to quarterly and
                                 annual real GNP to determine the sources and nature of long-term dependence in the business cycle

                              Abstract: Technical analysis, also known as charting, ' has been part of financial practice for many decades, but this discipline
                                 has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis.
                                 One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysis the presence of geometric shapes in historical
                                 price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical
                                 pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962
                                 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness to technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily
                                 stock returns to the conditional distribution conditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or double-bottoms
                                 we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have
                                 some practical value

                              We propose a nonparametric method for estimating the pricing formula of a derivative asset using learning networks. Although
                                 not a substitute for the more traditional arbitrage-based pricing formulas, network pricing formulas may be more accurate
                                 and computationally more efficient alternatives when the underlying asset's price dynamics are unknown, or when the pricing
                                 equation associated with no-arbitrage condition cannot be solved analytically. To assess the potential value of network pricing
                                 formulas, we simulate Black-Scholes option prices and show that learning networks can recover the Black-Scholes formula from
                                 a two-year training set of daily options prices, and that the resulting network formula can be used successfully to both price
                                 and delta-hedge options out-of-sample. For comparison, we estimate models using four popular methods: ordinary least squares,
                                 radial basis function networks, multilayer perceptron networks, and projection pursuit. To illustrate the practical relevance
                                 of our network pricing approach, we apply it to the pricing and delta-hedging of S&P 500 futures options from 1987 to 1991

                                 the financial crisis that started in the summer of 2007 and is, in several respects, still ongoing. Yet enough time has now
                                 elapsed for economists to dig deeper than the usual focus on the immediate causes and consequences of the crisis. How have
                                 these stunning events changed our thinking about the role of the financial system in the economy, about financial innovation,
                                 about the efficiency of financial markets, and about how the government should regulate finance?"
