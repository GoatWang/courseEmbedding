Cyber Document Protection
Anti-Tamper and DoquTrace protection









Protection

Watermarking creates a “protected copy”, which becomes the true master document. This master document is carried within the file so there is no need to use an external source for verification.








Document Anti-Tampering

Anti-Tamper Cloud DPS is based on protecting documents with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm and then comparing the original protected document with a returned document








DoquTrace

Documents protected with DoquTrace can provide dynamic access control to the document. Give control to who will have access to the document and when.

OCULUS ANNOUNCES DPS PRODUCT FOR PHOTOS AND PICTURES - Oculus VisionTech















































































OCULUS ANNOUNCES DPS PRODUCT FOR PHOTOS AND PICTURES							
								Published by Corey Leung on November 1, 2016











Vancouver, British Columbia, February 17, 2016: Oculus VisionTech Inc. (the “Company” or “Oculus”) (TSX.V: OVT; OTCQB: OVTZ) is pleased to announce that, subsequent to the successful completion of alpha testing of its Cloud-based Document Protection System (DPS) technology and the commencement of field trials of the document protection features of the Company’s Cloud-DPS technology (see news release of February 9, 2016), the Company is in the process of implementing its proprietary watermarking technology to its new photo DPS product that will offer online, Cloud-based security for documents in general, and that can be optimized for digital photographs in particular, and which is invariant to document/photo file format (and subsequently to today’s image/video CODECs).
The technology underlying the photo DPS product is on proprietary scanning technology that allows a digital picture to be scanned with an “image understanding” algorithm that identifies and extracts prominent image features. The Company’s proprietary DPS technology is based on protecting documents with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm and then comparing the original protected document with a returned document. If a document has been tampered with, the DPS document authentication feature will highlight the tampered locations in the document.
The initial goal of the photo DPS product will be to evaluate and confirm the digital photograph/picture authentication process, as well as the product’s ability to preserve the robustness and resilience of returned information, while minimizing false positives. Assuming successful validation, the Company expects to release a commercial version of the photo DPS system and begin nation-wide product field testing in the United States, during the second quarter of 2016.
Tom Perovic, a director of the Company, who is overseeing the testing and launch of the Company’s Cloud-DPS technology stated, “The offering of an online photo/picture DPS product will allow Oculus to open another vertical market, the social media market, which we expect will be another revenue-generating product for Oculus.”
About the Oculus Cloud-DPS Technology
The Oculus Cloud-DPS is an Internet-centric, Cloud-based web service for document tamper-proof protection and authentication. The first step is taking a document in digital form and protecting each page with an advanced, forensic-grade, invisible watermarking algorithm, and returning an image-based protected PDF document. The document is also encrypted to provide access control security. In the second step, the Oculus Cloud-DPS document authentication feature takes in the protected PDF document and returns authentication results. If the document was tampered with, the returned pages will highlight the tampered locations. Cloud-DPS technology is intended to protect high-value, sealed documents against any malicious tampering or forgery. Vertical target markets for high value documents have been identified as personal, real estate and corporate legal contracts, personal last wills, medical records, law enforcement records or financial institutions and government issued documents. The following document formats are accepted by the Cloud-DPS: *.doc, *.docx, *.xls, *.xlsx, *.xps, *.pdf, and *.jpg.
This news release does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to subscribe for or buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
About Oculus
Oculus designs and markets to business customers streaming video content distribution, and Internet Cloud-based digital document protection, based on embedded digital watermarking, as well as video-on-demand (VOD) systems, services and source-to-destination digital media delivery solutions that allow live or recorded digitized and compressed video to be transmitted through Internet, intranet, satellite or wireless connectivity. The Company’s systems, services and delivery solutions include document, still image and motion video digital watermark solutions and documents, photographs (still image) and video content protection.

Such forward-looking statements include, among others, statements as to the potential market for the Cloud-DPS technology, the continued successful testing of the Cloud-DPS and that the Cloud-DPS will produce revenue for Oculus. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. Such factors include, among others, the change of business focus of the management of Oculus, the inability of Oculus to pursue its current business objectives, due to lack of financing or otherwise, the failure of the Cloud-DPS to perform as expected, the ability of Oculus to successfully test and launch the Cloud-DPS as a commercially viable product. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release and Oculus assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in these forward-looking statements.

About Us						











Oculus VisionTech
Oculus VisionTech is a cyber security company recognized as one of the leaders in forensic watermarking. Using patented technology, Oculus VisionTech creates systems for document and multimedia protection to combat tampering and digital piracy. Headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the company was founded by experts in image processing and operated by experienced leadership.
Currently, Oculus VisionTech is promoting the imaged-based Document Protection System (DPS) and developing several other exciting products. Technology such as Anti-Tampering have been pioneered as part of the company’s efforts to remain a leader in forensic watermarking. Prior to the DPS, Oculus VisionTech created proprietary technology called Smart Marks, which created imperceptible watermarks for videos. Clients such as 20th Century Fox used this technology extensively to protect their videos from digital piracy.  Moving forward, Oculus VisionTech aims to continue to help solve some of the biggest cyber security problems across multiple industries.
