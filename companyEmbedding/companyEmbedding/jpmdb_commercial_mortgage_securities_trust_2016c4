NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: JPMDB Commercial Mortgage Securities

      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for JPMDB Commercial Mortgage

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$47,786,756a class NR.
    

      a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 21, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 36 loans secured by 42 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $1,124,378,757 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and German American Capital Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 90.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage is Below 2016 YTD Average: The pool has lower leverage 
      than other Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV for the trust are 1.23x and 102.4%, respectively, while the 2016 
      YTD averages are 1.19x and 105.8%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.16x and 113.2%, respectively.
    

      High Percentage of Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans in 
      the pool, representing 20.2%, have investment-grade credit opinions, 
      well above the 2016 YTD average of 7.4%. The two largest loans in the 
      pool, 9 West 57th Street (7.1%) and 10 Hudson Yards (7.1%), have 
      investment-grade credit opinions of 'AAAsf'* and 'BBBsf'*, respectively, 
      on a stand-alone basis. Moffett Gateway (3.8%), the ninth largest loan 
      in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a 
      stand-alone basis. Furthermore, Westfield San Francisco Centre (2.1%) 
      has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf'* on a stand-alone basis. 
      The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the 
      transaction of 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 26.750% and 9.125%, respectively.
    

      Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The 10 largest loans account for 51.9% 
      of the pool by balance, compared to the 2016 YTD average of 54.7%. The 
      pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 398, which is lower than the 
      2016 YTD average of 421.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMDB 2016-C4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could occur. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. 
      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

      Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: JPMDB Commercial Mortgage Securities 
      Trust 2016-C4 (US CMBS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889516
    

      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for JPMDB Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust 2016-C4 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$38,299,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$300,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$381,323,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$61,841,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$53,408,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,487,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,244,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$47,786,756a class NR.
    

      a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 21, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 36 loans secured by 42 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $1,124,378,757 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and German American Capital Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 90.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage is Below 2016 YTD Average: The pool has lower leverage 
      than other Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV for the trust are 1.23x and 102.4%, respectively, while the 2016 
      YTD averages are 1.19x and 105.8%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.16x and 113.2%, respectively.
    

      High Percentage of Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans in 
      the pool, representing 20.2%, have investment-grade credit opinions, 
      well above the 2016 YTD average of 7.4%. The two largest loans in the 
      pool, 9 West 57th Street (7.1%) and 10 Hudson Yards (7.1%), have 
      investment-grade credit opinions of 'AAAsf'* and 'BBBsf'*, respectively, 
      on a stand-alone basis. Moffett Gateway (3.8%), the ninth largest loan 
      in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a 
      stand-alone basis. Furthermore, Westfield San Francisco Centre (2.1%) 
      has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf'* on a stand-alone basis. 
      The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the 
      transaction of 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 26.750% and 9.125%, respectively.
    

      Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The 10 largest loans account for 51.9% 
      of the pool by balance, compared to the 2016 YTD average of 54.7%. The 
      pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 398, which is lower than the 
      2016 YTD average of 421.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMDB 2016-C4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could occur. The presale report

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. 
      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      Copyright Â© 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: JPMDB Commercial Mortgage Securities 
      Trust 2016-C4 (US CMBS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889516


      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for JPMDB Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust 2016-C4 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$38,299,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$300,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$381,323,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,443,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$879,826,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$61,841,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92,761,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$61,841,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,786,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$101,194,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$53,408,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,487,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11,244,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$47,786,756a class NR.
    

      a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 21, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 36 loans secured by 42 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $1,124,378,757 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association and German American Capital Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 90.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage is Below 2016 YTD Average: The pool has lower leverage 
      than other Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      and LTV for the trust are 1.23x and 102.4%, respectively, while the 2016 
      YTD averages are 1.19x and 105.8%. Excluding credit-opinion loans, the 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV are 1.16x and 113.2%, respectively.
    

      High Percentage of Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Four loans in 
      the pool, representing 20.2%, have investment-grade credit opinions, 
      well above the 2016 YTD average of 7.4%. The two largest loans in the 
      pool, 9 West 57th Street (7.1%) and 10 Hudson Yards (7.1%), have 
      investment-grade credit opinions of 'AAAsf'* and 'BBBsf'*, respectively, 
      on a stand-alone basis. Moffett Gateway (3.8%), the ninth largest loan 
      in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a 
      stand-alone basis. Furthermore, Westfield San Francisco Centre (2.1%) 
      has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'Asf'* on a stand-alone basis. 
      The implied credit enhancement levels for the conduit portion of the 
      transaction of 'AAAsf' and 'BBB-sf' are 26.750% and 9.125%, respectively.
    

      Concentrated Pool by Loan Size: The 10 largest loans account for 51.9% 
      of the pool by balance, compared to the 2016 YTD average of 54.7%. The 
      pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 398, which is lower than the 
      2016 YTD average of 421.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMDB 2016-C4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could occur. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 12.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. 
      A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and weâll set up your first campaign for you for free. Weâll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. Weâre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
