Product Spotlight - Bank Loans



Bank Loans


Western Asset's bank loan portfolio management philosophy asserts that the integration of superior fundamental credit research, relative-value analysis, and proper risk management should generate outperformance over a market cycle. The Firm's investments for bank loan portfolios include the full spectrum of below investment-grade corporate issues, ranging from conservative to aggressive and varying by quality, issuer and subsector. 



Market Review 3Q 2013
The S&P/LSTA Performing Loan Index returned 1.21% over the third quarter. Bank loans have now recorded eight consecutive quarters of positive returns. The average price of a loan in the market increased by $0.41 to $98.09 as demand continued to provide a strong tailwind to bank loan performance. The session began with a continuation of the rising interest rate environment that was set in motion during 2Q13. Expectations were that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would announce the tapering of its monthly asset purchases at its meeting on September 18. Ultimately, the Fed proved market pundits incorrect as it chose not to taper due to a lack of sustained improvement in key data points. US Treasury yields fell sharply. Yields were also driven lower as it became increasingly likely that a federal budget would not be agreed to in time, which would trigger a partial shutdown of the federal government on October 1. 
On the economic side of the equation, the data remained uninspiring. Annualized 2Q13 GDP was finalized at 2.5%, coming in at the middle of the range that had been forecast. Though the unemployment rate moved lower, this was partially due to a decline in the participation rate. In all, bank loan spreads moved marginally lower, finishing the quarter 3 basis points (bps) tighter at LIBOR+447 bps. 
Spreads have ratcheted 37 bps tighter since the end of 2012. Yields also fell by a small amount over the quarter. The yield-to-call (three-year assumption) dropped from 4.76% at the end of June to 4.74% at the end of September. In terms of ratings, B rated loans generated the best performance for the quarter, up 1.39%, followed by BBs (1.10% return) while CCCs lagged (0.54% return). However, CCCs have outperformed by a wide margin over the first nine months of 2013, gaining 7.06%, while Bs and BBs have returned 3.87% and 2.51%, respectively. The largest and most liquid loans in the marketplace, as proxied by the S&P/LSTA Loan 100 Index, performed slightly worse than the broader market, returning 1.15%. This index is also lagging on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, having returned only 3.13% for the period. Relative to other asset classes, bank loans performance is right in line with the risk spectrum. Loans outperformed most major duration-sensitive fixed-income sectors, including US Treasuries (UST) (0.70% return), investment-grade credit (0.72% return) and mortgage-backed securities (1.03% return). On the other end of the spectrum, loans underperformed high-yield debt, which gained 2.28%, and the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which returned 5.25%. 
Demand continued to be heavy and steady during the quarter. Combined demand from collateralized-loan obligations (CLO) and retail investors was $33.3 billion, making it the third highest quarterly total on record. Total demand for the year has been just over $107 billion. Retail demand totaled $18.1 billion during 3Q13 as weekly flows averaged over $1.5 billion. Investors have put just under $50 billion into bank loan mutual funds and exchange traded funds so far this year. At this pace, 2013 net flows would be four times larger than any previous annual period. New CLO deals netted to $15.2 billion. For the YTD period, CLO generation has totaled $57.5 billion, already surpassing 2012's post crisis high of $53.5 billion. Estimates for 2013 are in the $70 billion range. Loans slowed from the previous quarter but remained elevated versus long-term averages. Institutional loan volume was $100.8 billion. 
The period was anchored by two large deals that both came in September: Hilton Worldwide refinanced $7.6 billion and Dell's much anticipated buyout financing of $6.2 billion allocated. For the year, arrangers have brought over $366 billion in new loans to market. The bank loan primary market is likely to eclipse 2007's record year of $387 billion. New-issue all-in yields declined over the quarter. The total all-in spread (including straight spread, upfront fee and LIBOR floor) offered to new BB loan investors was 353 bps, while Bs offered 487 bps. This represented a fall of 20 bps to 25 bps in spread versus the previous quarter. Covenant-lite loans continued to account for over 50% of new-issue volume in September and refinancing continued to be the primary use of proceeds. 
From a fundamental perspective, quarterly issuer financials continued to show signs of slowing as it related to revenues. The year-over-year change in EBITDA slowed to 6.1% from 6.8% at the end of 1Q13, while revenues fell to 9.3%. Leverage and coverage multiples continued to be supportive, however. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio for loan issuers fell to 5 times from 5.3 times at the end of 2012. Coverage ratios were elevated as cashflow coverage and interest coverage multiples were 3.2 times and 4.3 times, respectively. The positive fundamental environment has helped to keep defaults down. According to Moody's, the trailing 12-month issuer weighted default rate for the bank loan market remained unchanged at 2.5%. This was slightly higher than the 2Q13 default rate of 2.3%. S&P registered similar numbers with an issuer-rated default rate of 1.8% and a par-weighted default rate of 2.4%.

The Importance of Income
February 2012
As investors, we know that income is an essential component of total return. Income clearly demonstrates its importance in the fixed-income market, but is also critically important in equities, real estate and currency investing. One of the key issues that investors must confront today is the prospect of receiving significantly less income in the future than they have in the past, primarily due to the efforts of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower most interest rates.






The Importance of Income Part 2:The Rule of 72
November 2012
Most of us have learned the rule of 72 somewhere along the way in our financial careers. Simply stated, divide 72 by your expected annual return and the result will be the approximate time it will take for your investment to double. Historically, the 10% annualized return expectation for equities suggested that an investment would double in just over seven years (72/10).

Product Spotlight - Bank Loans



Bank Loans


Western Asset's bank loan portfolio management philosophy asserts that the integration of superior fundamental credit research, relative-value analysis, and proper risk management should generate outperformance over a market cycle. The Firm's investments for bank loan portfolios include the full spectrum of below investment-grade corporate issues, ranging from conservative to aggressive and varying by quality, issuer and subsector. 



Market Review 3Q 2013
The S&P/LSTA Performing Loan Index returned 1.21% over the third quarter. Bank loans have now recorded eight consecutive quarters of positive returns. The average price of a loan in the market increased by $0.41 to $98.09 as demand continued to provide a strong tailwind to bank loan performance. The session began with a continuation of the rising interest rate environment that was set in motion during 2Q13. Expectations were that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would announce the tapering of its monthly asset purchases at its meeting on September 18. Ultimately, the Fed proved market pundits incorrect as it chose not to taper due to a lack of sustained improvement in key data points. US Treasury yields fell sharply. Yields were also driven lower as it became increasingly likely that a federal budget would not be agreed to in time, which would trigger a partial shutdown of the federal government on October 1. 
On the economic side of the equation, the data remained uninspiring. Annualized 2Q13 GDP was finalized at 2.5%, coming in at the middle of the range that had been forecast. Though the unemployment rate moved lower, this was partially due to a decline in the participation rate. In all, bank loan spreads moved marginally lower, finishing the quarter 3 basis points (bps) tighter at LIBOR+447 bps. 
Spreads have ratcheted 37 bps tighter since the end of 2012. Yields also fell by a small amount over the quarter. The yield-to-call (three-year assumption) dropped from 4.76% at the end of June to 4.74% at the end of September. In terms of ratings, B rated loans generated the best performance for the quarter, up 1.39%, followed by BBs (1.10% return) while CCCs lagged (0.54% return). However, CCCs have outperformed by a wide margin over the first nine months of 2013, gaining 7.06%, while Bs and BBs have returned 3.87% and 2.51%, respectively. The largest and most liquid loans in the marketplace, as proxied by the S&P/LSTA Loan 100 Index, performed slightly worse than the broader market, returning 1.15%. This index is also lagging on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, having returned only 3.13% for the period. Relative to other asset classes, bank loans performance is right in line with the risk spectrum. Loans outperformed most major duration-sensitive fixed-income sectors, including US Treasuries (UST) (0.70% return), investment-grade credit (0.72% return) and mortgage-backed securities (1.03% return). On the other end of the spectrum, loans underperformed high-yield debt, which gained 2.28%, and the S&P 500 Total Return Index, which returned 5.25%. 
Demand continued to be heavy and steady during the quarter. Combined demand from collateralized-loan obligations (CLO) and retail investors was $33.3 billion, making it the third highest quarterly total on record. Total demand for the year has been just over $107 billion. Retail demand totaled $18.1 billion during 3Q13 as weekly flows averaged over $1.5 billion. Investors have put just under $50 billion into bank loan mutual funds and exchange traded funds so far this year. At this pace, 2013 net flows would be four times larger than any previous annual period. New CLO deals netted to $15.2 billion. For the YTD period, CLO generation has totaled $57.5 billion, already surpassing 2012's post crisis high of $53.5 billion. Estimates for 2013 are in the $70 billion range. Loans slowed from the previous quarter but remained elevated versus long-term averages. Institutional loan volume was $100.8 billion. 
The period was anchored by two large deals that both came in September: Hilton Worldwide refinanced $7.6 billion and Dell's much anticipated buyout financing of $6.2 billion allocated. For the year, arrangers have brought over $366 billion in new loans to market. The bank loan primary market is likely to eclipse 2007's record year of $387 billion. New-issue all-in yields declined over the quarter. The total all-in spread (including straight spread, upfront fee and LIBOR floor) offered to new BB loan investors was 353 bps, while Bs offered 487 bps. This represented a fall of 20 bps to 25 bps in spread versus the previous quarter. Covenant-lite loans continued to account for over 50% of new-issue volume in September and refinancing continued to be the primary use of proceeds. 
From a fundamental perspective, quarterly issuer financials continued to show signs of slowing as it related to revenues. The year-over-year change in EBITDA slowed to 6.1% from 6.8% at the end of 1Q13, while revenues fell to 9.3%. Leverage and coverage multiples continued to be supportive, however. The debt-to-EBITDA ratio for loan issuers fell to 5 times from 5.3 times at the end of 2012. Coverage ratios were elevated as cashflow coverage and interest coverage multiples were 3.2 times and 4.3 times, respectively. The positive fundamental environment has helped to keep defaults down. According to Moody's, the trailing 12-month issuer weighted default rate for the bank loan market remained unchanged at 2.5%. This was slightly higher than the 2Q13 default rate of 2.3%. S&P registered similar numbers with an issuer-rated default rate of 1.8% and a par-weighted default rate of 2.4%.

Bank Loan Investment Report






The white papers below are relevant to the use of Bank Loans within a portfolio.




The Importance of Income
February 2012
As investors, we know that income is an essential component of total return. Income clearly demonstrates its importance in the fixed-income market, but is also critically important in equities, real estate and currency investing. One of the key issues that investors must confront today is the prospect of receiving significantly less income in the future than they have in the past, primarily due to the efforts of the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower most interest rates.






The Importance of Income Part 2:The Rule of 72
November 2012
Most of us have learned the rule of 72 somewhere along the way in our financial careers. Simply stated, divide 72 by your expected annual return and the result will be the approximate time it will take for your investment to double. Historically, the 10% annualized return expectation for equities suggested that an investment would double in just over seven years (72/10).

The Fund has an anticipated 8-year term, with termination expected on December 30, 2022. The Fund’s term may be longer, depending on market conditions. If the Fund’s board of directors determines that under then-current market conditions it is in the best interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may extend the termination date for one year, to December 29, 2023, without a stockholder vote. The Fund’s termination date can be further extended beyond December 29, 2023 by 75% of the directors and 75% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




An investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. The Fund should be considered an illiquid investment. The Fund does not intend to apply for an exchange listing, and it is highly unlikely that a secondary market will exist for the purchase and sale of the Fund's Common Stock. You could lose some or all of your investment. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment for investors who are prepared to hold the Fund's Common Stock until the expiration of its term, and is not a trading vehicle. All investments are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. Fixed income securities are subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to: credit, inflation, income, prepayment and interest rates risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. Middle market companies have additional risks due to their limited operating histories, limited financial resources, less predictable operating results, narrower product lines and other factors. High yield bonds ("junk bonds") are subject to higher credit risk and a greater risk of default. The Fund may invest all or a portion of its Managed Assets in illiquid securities. The Fund may make significant investments in securities for which there are no observable market prices; the prices of which must be estimated by the investment manager. Investments in foreign securities involve risks, including the possibility of losses due to changes in currency exchange rates and negative developments in the political, economic or regulatory structure of specific countries or regions. These risks are greater in emerging markets. Leverage may result in greater volatility of net asset value (NAV) of common shares and increases a shareholder's risk of loss. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based NAV assume the reinvestment of all distributions at NAV. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.
 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. 
 
Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV. 



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average daily Managed Assets. “Managed Assets” are defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowing, including loans from certain financial institutions and/or the issuance of debt securities (collectively, “Borrowings”), and assets attributable to any preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) that may be outstanding. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). For this purpose, if two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the lowest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

Holdings









IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

These materials and any tax-related statements are not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used or relied upon, by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Tax-related statements, if any, may have been written in connection with the "promotion or marketing" of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by these materials, to the extent allowed by applicable law.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.
Note that unlike other closed-end funds, Western Asset Middle Market Debt Fund and the Western Asset Middle Market Income Fund are not publicly traded, and are closed to new investors.

Shares of Putnam High Income Bond Fund (NYSE PCF) traded up 0.45% during midday trading on Friday, reaching $8.93. The research firm ranks the sentiment of news coverage by monitoring more than twenty million news and blog sources in real time. Accern ranks coverage of companies on a scale of negative one to positive one, with scores nearest to one being the most favorable.Equity analyst Jefferies both downgraded the stock and lowered the price target on January 12 cutting the price target from $23.00 to $19.00 and moving the rating from "Hold" to "Underperform". Putnam High Income Bond Fund earned a coverage optimism score of 0.35 on Accern's scale. First Trust Enhanced Equity Income Fund has a 52-week low of $12.59 and a 52-week high of $15.15. Accern also assigned news coverage about the financial services provider an impact score of 0 out of 100, meaning that recent press coverage is extremely unlikely to have an effect on the stock's share price in the near term. This represents a $0.66 annualized dividend and a dividend yield of 5.12%. The ex-dividend date is Wednesday, July 19th. The sale was disclosed in a legal filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, which is available at the SEC website.1,541K shares changed hands in the last trading session.COPYRIGHT VIOLATION NOTICE: This report was published by The Cerbat Gem and is the sole property of of The Cerbat Gem.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risks, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund's investments are subject to credit risk, inflation risk, and interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. The Fund may invest in lower-rated high yield bonds which are subject to greater credit risk (risk of default) than higher-rated obligations. Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder's risk of loss.The Fund may invest to a limited extent in foreign securities, including emerging markets. These securities involve additional risks. The Fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

 Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV.
*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV. As of 06/30/2017, the fund estimates that the distributions will be paid from: 100.00% investment income;0.00% realized capital gains; and, 0.00% return of capital. The Distribution Rate is subject to change and is not a quotation of Fund performance. The Board of Directors may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time. Any such termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. For more information about a distribution's composition refer to the Fund's distribution press release or, if applicable, the Section 19 notice located in the Press Releases section below.


Effective June 1, 2017, the Fund changed its security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV. Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average monthly net assets. The Management fee ratio reflects a contractual waiver/or expense reimbursement, if any, by the fund's investment adviser. Absent the fee waiver/or expense reimbursements, expenses would be higher and total returns would be less. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
 


Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.
