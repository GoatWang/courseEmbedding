GE TransportationAccording to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. exported $2.1 trillion worth of goods in 2011.
And a according to a new study by the Brookings titled Export Nation 2012, exports played a major role in pulling the U.S. economy out of recession, even as jobs were vanishing.
Exports jumped by over 11 percent in 2010--the first year of the recovery.  This represented the fastest growth rate since 1997.
Jobs supported by exports grew by 6 percent during that same period.
“Exports are helping to lead us out of the recession and into recovery,” says Emilia Istrate, lead author of the new report.
"Manufacturing industries accounted for about 61 percent of U.S. exports and produced three-quarters of the nation’s additional sales abroad between 2009 and 2010."
What follows are the top 10 U.S. manufactured exports in 2010, which helped carry us out of the recession.

FDA may provide this certification in a form the agency determines appropriate. For food products, FDA provides written certification for exports in the form of certificates and list of eligible exporters for specific products or destinations. Please note that FDA does not require written certification for exports.If you export food, it is your responsibility to:• Follow U.S. laws and regulations• Follow the requirements of the countries to which you export
