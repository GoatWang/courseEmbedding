SEATTLE, Oct. 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- RealNetworks, Inc. (Nasdaq:   RNWK) today announced that Dawn G. Lepore has been appointed to the company's board of directors.  
"We are delighted to have Dawn join the board as we continue to revitalize RealNetworks," said Rob Glaser, chairman and interim CEO of RealNetworks. "Dawn brings a rare combination of deep operational expertise, keen strategic insights, and a wealth of public company board experience to her appointment."
Ms. Lepore currently serves on the boards of AOL and The TJX Companies, and recently stepped down from the board of eBay after 13 years of service.  Ms. Lepore led e-commerce company drugstore.com, as its chairman and CEO, from October 2004 until its sale to Walgreens in 2011.  Prior to that, during her 21-year tenure at Charles Schwab, Ms. Lepore held several senior leadership positions, including vice chairman and chief information officer. Ms. Lepore holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Smith College.
"With deep roots in innovation in the digital media industry, RealNetworks has an impressive portfolio of products and technology," said Ms. Lepore. "I look forward to working with the RealNetworks team at this pivotal time in its history."
With Ms. Lepore's appointment, the number of directors on RealNetworks' board increases to eight; however, the company's board size will be reduced to seven immediately following the 2013 annual meeting of shareholders. After 12 years of service, Kalpana Raina will be stepping down from the RealNetworks board in mid-November, at the end of her current term.
"On behalf of Real's board, I want to express my sincere appreciation for Kalpana's 12 years of service to RealNetworks," Glaser said. "We are grateful to Kalpana for her dedication and professionalism, and we wish her the best in her future endeavors."
