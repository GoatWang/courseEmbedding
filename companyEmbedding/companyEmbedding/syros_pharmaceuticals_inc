An Expression Makes a World of Difference






At Syros, we are pioneering a new area of medicine focused on controlling the expression of genes. The genes expressed - turned on, off, up or down - in any given cell determine its type and function. By creating medicines to control the expression of genes that have gone awry in disease, we aim to make a profound difference in the lives of patients and their families. Join us in understanding the coordinated expression of the Syros team in fulfilling our mission. 
Get to Know us













We Understand How the Expression of Genes Is Controlled

Regulatory regions of the genome control the expression of genes, turning them on, off, up or down, like genomic dimmer switches and determining how a cell behaves, whether it is a skin cell or a lung cell, whether it is normal or diseased. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, alterations in these regulatory regions contribute to virtually all diseases. But until recently, scientists lacked the tools to study these regulatory regions, rendering them poorly understood and largely unexploited for drug discovery and development.
We have built the first platform dedicated to the regulatory genome to systematically and efficiently identify disease-causing alterations in gene expression and develop medicines that control the expression of genes with the aim of providing a profound and durable benefit for patients with diseases that have largely eluded other genomics-based approaches.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY






	        



	This summary highlights, and is qualified in its entirety by, the more detailed information included elsewhere in this
	prospectus or incorporated by reference. This summary does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read and carefully consider the
	entire prospectus, especially the "Risk Factors" section of this prospectus, before deciding to invest in our common stock.







	Overview





	        We are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the non-coding regulatory region of the genome controlling the activation and
	repression of genes. Our goal is to advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of disease-driving genes. We have built a proprietary gene control platform designed to systematically and
	efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental
	to the function of all cells, we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic areas and a range of
	diseases. By focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients, we believe we can conduct efficient clinical trials with a higher likelihood of success. We are currently focused on developing
	treatments for cancer and immune-mediated diseases and are building a pipeline of gene control medicines.




	        In
	September 2016, we began enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial for our lead product candidate, SY-1425 (tamibarotene), an oral, potent and selective retinoic acid
	receptor alpha, or RAR

	a

	, agonist, in genomically defined subsets of patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML, and relapsed
	high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS. In the fourth quarter of 2016, an investigational device exemption for the assay being used to select patients for this trial was approved by the U.S. Food
	and Drug Administration. With this approval, we have expanded this trial to include newly diagnosed AML patients who are at least 60 years old and are not suitable candidates for standard
	chemotherapy, and lower-risk, transfusion-dependent MDS patients. During 2017, we further expanded this trial to explore the safety and efficacy of SY-1425 when combined with azacitidine, a
	hypomethylating agent that is commonly used to treat AML, in newly diagnosed AML patients who are at least 60 years old and not suitable candidates for standard chemotherapy. On the basis of
	preclinical data we have generated, we also plan to pursue clinical development of SY-1425 in combination with a therapeutic anti-CD38 antibody in defined subsets of AML and MDS patients identified
	using our biomarkers. In May 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for our development candidate SY-1365, a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase
	7, or CDK7, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Both of these programs may have potential in additional disease indications. Using our platform, we are also generating a pipeline of novel
	preclinical drug candidates in cancer, including immuno-oncology, and advancing our research efforts in autoimmune and rare genetic diseases. We plan to advance one of our four preclinical programs to
	support a potential investigational new drug application, or IND, filing in 2019. Our goal is to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company based on our leadership position in gene control.

	        We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 9, 2011 under the name LS22, Inc. Our executive offices

	Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company





	        As a company with less than $1.0 billion of revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in
	the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on certain exemptions from various public
	reporting requirements, including the requirement that our internal control over financial reporting be audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of
	the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, certain requirements related to the disclosure of executive compensation in this prospectus and in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and the requirement that
	we hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition
	period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised
	accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Because we intend to rely on certain disclosure and other requirements of the JOBS Act, the information contained
	herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies in which you hold stock. In addition, it is possible that some investors will find our common stock less attractive
	as a result of our determination to avail ourselves of exemptions under the JOBS Act, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and higher volatility in our stock price. We
	will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier to occur of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more;
	(2) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the closing of our initial public offering; (3) the date on which we have issued more than
	$1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (4) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission.

	DESCRIPTION OF PRIVATE PLACEMENT WITH THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS






	        On April 20, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement with the selling stockholders whereby, on
	April 26, 2017 we issued and sold 2,592,591 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.50 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $35.0 million. For a detailed description of the
	transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement with the selling stockholders and the securities issued pursuant thereto, see the section captioned "Selling Stockholders" in this
	prospectus. We filed the registration statement on Form S-1, of which this prospectus forms a part, to fulfill our contractual obligations under the registration rights agreement
	entered into concurrently with the securities purchase agreement with the selling stockholders to provide for the resale by the selling stockholders of the shares of common stock offered hereby.

	DIVIDEND POLICY






	        We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance
	the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in respect of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be made
	at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on restrictions and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. Investors should not purchase our common stock with the
	expectation of receiving cash dividends.

	DILUTION






	        This offering is for sales of common stock, if any, by the selling stockholders on a continuous or delayed basis in the future. Sales of common
	stock by the selling stockholders will not result in a change to the net tangible book value per share before and after the distribution of shares by such selling stockholders.




	        There
	will be no change in net tangible book value per share attributable to cash payments made by purchasers of the shares being offered. Prospective investors should be aware, however,
	that the price of shares of common stock may not bear any rational relationship to net tangible book value per share of the common stock.

	DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK








	General





	        Our authorized capital stock consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred
	stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which preferred stock is undesignated. The following description of our capital stock and provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended
	and restated bylaws are summaries and are qualified by reference to our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws,
	copies of which are filed with the SEC as exhibits to our registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.






	Common Stock





	        Holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have
	cumulative voting rights. An election of directors by our stockholders is determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the election. Other matters are decided by
	the affirmative vote of our stockholders having a majority in voting power of the votes cast by the stockholders present or represented and voting on such matter, except as otherwise disclosed below.
	Holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately any dividends as may be declared by our board of directors, subject to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding preferred stock.




	        In
	the event of our liquidation or dissolution, the holders of common stock are entitled to receive proportionately all assets available for distribution to stockholders after the
	payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any outstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion
	rights. The rights, preferences and privileges of holders of common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of preferred stock that we
	may designate and issue in the future.






	Preferred Stock





	        Under the terms of our restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or
	more series without stockholder approval. Our board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights,
	conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences, of each series of preferred stock.




	        The
	purpose of authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on specific
	issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, future financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it
	more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, a majority of our outstanding voting stock. There are no shares of preferred stock currently
	outstanding.






	Registration Rights








	Resale Registration Rights






	        Under the registration rights agreement for the April 2017 private placement, we have agreed to file the registration statement of which this
	prospectus is a part with the SEC, covering the resale of the 2,592,591 shares of common stock issued in such private placement.

	Table of Contents








	Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement






	        The amended and restated investors' rights agreement, dated as of October 9, 2014, as amended, which we refer to as our investors' rights
	agreement, by and among our company and certain of our stockholders, provides specified holders of our previously outstanding preferred stock, including some of our directors and 5% stockholders and
	their respective affiliates and entities affiliated with our officers and directors, the right to require us to register the shares of common stock that were issued upon conversion of the preferred
	stock under the Securities Act under specified circumstances as described below. After registration pursuant to these rights, these shares will become freely tradable without restriction under the
	Securities Act.






	Demand Registration Rights





	        Subject to specified limitations set forth in our investors' rights agreement, at any time the holders of 25% of then outstanding registrable
	securities, as defined in the investor's rights agreement, acting together, may demand in writing that we register their registrable securities under the Securities Act so long as the total amount of
	registrable shares requested to be registered has an anticipated aggregate offering price to the public, net of selling expenses, as defined in the investors' rights agreement, that would exceed
	$5.0 million. We are not obligated to effect a registration statement pursuant to this demand provision on more than two occasions, subject to specified exceptions.




	        In
	addition, at any time after we become eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, subject to specified limitations, the holders of at
	least 25% of the registrable securities then outstanding may demand in writing that we register on Form S-3 registrable shares held by them so long as the total amount of registrable shares
	requested to be registered has an anticipated aggregate offering price to the public, net of selling expenses, as defined in the investors' rights agreement, of at least $2.0 million. We are
	not obligated to effect a registration statement pursuant to this demand provision on more than two occasions in any twelve-month period, subject to specified exceptions.






	Incidental Registration Rights





	        If, at any time, we propose to file a registration statement to register any of our securities under the Securities Act, either for our
	own account or for the account of any of our stockholders that are not holders of registrable shares, solely for cash and on a form that would also permit the registration of registrable shares, the
	holders of our registrable shares are entitled to notice of registration and, subject to specified exceptions, we will be required to register the registrable shares then held by them that they
	request that we register.






	Expenses





	        Pursuant to the investor's rights agreement, we are required to pay all registration expenses, including registration fees, printing expenses,
	fees and disbursements of our counsel and accountants and reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel representing the selling stockholders, other than any underwriting discounts and commissions,
	related to any demand or incidental registration. The investor's rights agreement contains customary cross-indemnification
	provisions, pursuant to which we are obligated to indemnify the selling stockholders in the event of material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement attributable to us, and they are
	obligated to indemnify us for material misstatements or omissions in the registration statement attributable to them.






	Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Charter and Bylaws





	        Delaware law and our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of
	delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from




	9











	Table of Contents





	acquiring
	control of us. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to
	encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors.







	Staggered Board; Removal of Directors






	        Our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes with staggered
	three-year terms. In addition, a director may only be removed for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all of our stockholders would be entitled to
	cast in an annual election of directors. Any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may only be filled by vote of a majority of
	our directors then in office. The classification of our board of directors and the limitations on the removal of directors and filling of vacancies could make it more difficult for a third party to
	acquire, or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire, control of our company.







	Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings






	        Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a
	duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws
	also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of our stockholders can only be called by our chairman of the board, our chief executive officer or our board of directors.







	Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals






	        Our amended and restated bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of
	stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting may only consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of
	meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who
	has delivered timely written notice in proper form to our secretary of the stockholder's intention to bring such business before the meeting. These provisions could have the effect of delaying until
	the next stockholder meeting stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities.







	Delaware Business Combination Statute






	        We are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Subject to certain exceptions, Section 203
	prevents a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with any "interested stockholder" for three years following the date that the person became an interested
	stockholder, unless the interested stockholder attained such status with the approval of our board of directors or unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A "business
	combination" includes, among other things, a merger or consolidation involving us and the "interested stockholder" and a sale involving us and the "interested stockholder" of 10% or more of our
	assets. In general, an "interested stockholder" is any entity or person beneficially owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and any entity or person affiliated with or controlling or
	controlled by such entity or person.

	Table of Contents








	Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws






	        The General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides generally that the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote
	on any matter is required to amend a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, as the case may be, requires a greater
	percentage. Our bylaws may be amended or repealed by a majority vote of our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all of our stockholders would
	be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors. In addition, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all of our stockholders would be entitled to cast in any
	annual election of directors is required to amend or repeal or to adopt any provisions inconsistent with any of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above under
	"Staggered Board; Removal of Directors" and "Stockholder Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings."







	Exclusive Forum Selection






	        Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of
	Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for
	(1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or
	employees to our company or our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against our company arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or
	our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or (4) any action asserting a claim against our company governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Although our
	restated certificate of incorporation contains the choice of forum provision described above, it is possible that a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable for a particular claim or
	action or that such provision is unenforceable.






	Listing on The NASDAQ Global Market





	        Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol "SYRS."






	Authorized but Unissued Shares





	        The authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject
	to any limitations imposed by the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Market. These additional shares may be used for a variety of corporate finance transactions, acquisitions and employee
	benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a
	proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.









	Transfer Agent and Registrar





	        The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.

	SELLING STOCKHOLDERS






	        On April 20, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with the selling stockholders, pursuant to
	which we issued and sold 2,592,591 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.50 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $35.0 million, which we refer to as the Private Placement.




	        In
	connection with the Private Placement, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the selling stockholders, dated as of April 20, 2017, or the Registration Rights
	Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC covering the resale of the shares of common stock sold in the Private Placement. We agreed to file such
	registration statement within 30 days of the closing of the Private Placement. The Registration Rights Agreement includes customary indemnification rights in connection with the registration
	statement. The registration statement of which this prospectus is a part has been filed in accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement.




	        The
	foregoing summary descriptions of the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
	full text of such documents, which were filed as exhibits to our Current Report on Form 8-K, dated April 20, 2017, and are incorporated by reference herein.




	        The
	table below sets forth, to our knowledge, information concerning the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders as of April 26, 2017. The
	information in the table below with respect to the selling stockholders has been obtained from the selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may sell all, some or none of the shares of common
	stock subject to this prospectus. See "Plan of Distribution."




	        Beneficial
	ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with respect to shares. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our
	knowledge, all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to their shares of common stock, except to the extent authority is shared by spouses under applicable law.
	The inclusion of any shares in this table does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership for the person named below.

	We
	do not know when or in what amounts a selling stockholder may offer shares for sale. The selling stockholders might not sell any or all of the shares offered by
	this prospectus. Because the selling stockholders may offer all or some of the shares pursuant to this offering, and because there are currently no agreements, arrangements or understandings with
	respect to the sale of any of the shares, we cannot estimate the number of the shares that will be held by the selling stockholders after completion of the offering. However, for purposes of this

	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        The shares covered by this prospectus may be offered and sold from time to time by the selling stockholders. The term "selling stockholders"
	includes donees, pledgees, transferees or other successors-in-interest selling shares received after the date of this prospectus from a selling stockholder as a gift, pledge, partnership distribution
	or other non-sale related transfer. The selling stockholders will act independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and size of each sale. Such sales may be made on one or
	more exchanges or in the over-the-counter market or otherwise, at prices and under terms then prevailing or at prices related to the then current market price or in negotiated transactions. The
	selling stockholders may sell their shares by one or more of, or a combination of, the following methods:






	




	purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by such broker-dealer for its own account pursuant to this prospectus;








	




	ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker solicits purchasers;








	




	block trades in which the broker-dealer so engaged will attempt to sell the shares as agent but may position and resell a portion of the block
	as principal to facilitate the transaction;








	




	an over-the-counter distribution in accordance with the NASDAQ rules;








	




	in privately negotiated transactions; and








	




	in options transactions.






	        In
	addition, any shares that qualify for sale pursuant to Rule 144 may be sold under Rule 144 rather than pursuant to this prospectus.

	the extent required, this prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. In connection with distributions of the shares or
	otherwise, the selling stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions. In connection with such transactions, broker-dealers or other financial
	institutions may engage in short sales of the common stock in the course of hedging the positions they assume with selling stockholders. The selling stockholders may also sell the common stock short
	and redeliver the shares to close out such short positions. The selling stockholders may also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions which require
	the delivery to such broker-dealer or other financial institution of shares offered by this prospectus, which shares such broker-dealer or other
	financial institution may resell pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect such transaction). The selling stockholders may also pledge shares to a broker-dealer or other
	financial institution, and, upon a default, such broker-dealer or other financial institution, may effect sales of the pledged shares pursuant to this prospectus (as supplemented or amended to reflect
	such transaction).




	        In
	effecting sales, broker-dealers or agents engaged by the selling stockholders may arrange for other broker-dealers to participate. Broker-dealers or agents may receive commissions,
	discounts or concessions from the selling stockholders in amounts to be negotiated immediately prior to the sale.




	        In
	offering the shares covered by this prospectus, the selling stockholders and any broker-dealers who execute sales for the selling stockholders may be deemed to be "underwriters"
	within the meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. Any profits realized by the selling stockholders and the compensation of any broker-dealer may be deemed to be underwriting
	discounts and commissions.




	        In
	order to comply with the securities laws of certain states, if applicable, the shares must be sold in such jurisdictions only through registered or licensed brokers or dealers. In
	addition, in certain states the shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration or qualification requirement
	is available and is complied with.

	        We
	have advised the selling stockholders that the anti-manipulation rules of Regulation M under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of shares in the market and to the activities
	of the selling stockholders and their affiliates. In addition, we will make copies of this prospectus available to the selling stockholders for the purpose of satisfying the prospectus delivery
	requirements of the Securities Act. The selling stockholders may indemnify any broker-dealer that participates in transactions involving the sale of the shares against certain liabilities, including
	liabilities arising under the Securities Act.




	        At
	the time a particular offer of shares is made, if required, a prospectus supplement will be distributed that will set forth the number of shares being offered and the terms of the
	offering, including the name of any underwriter, dealer or agent, the purchase price paid by any underwriter, any discount, commission and other item constituting compensation, any discount,
	commission or concession allowed or reallowed or paid to any dealer, and the proposed selling price to the public.




	        We
	have agreed to indemnify the selling stockholders against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act.




	        We
	have agreed with the selling stockholders to keep the registration statement of which this prospectus constitutes a part effective until the earlier of (i) such time as all of
	the shares covered by this prospectus have been disposed of pursuant to and in accordance with the registration statement or (ii) the date on which all of the shares may be sold without
	restriction pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act.

	Item 14.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers.






	        Section 102 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware permits a corporation to eliminate the personal liability of its
	directors or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except where the director breached his or her duty of
	loyalty, failed to act in good faith, engaged in intentional misconduct or knowingly violated a law, authorized the payment of a dividend or approved a stock repurchase in violation of Delaware
	corporate law or obtained an improper personal benefit. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of our directors shall be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary
	damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability, except to the extent that the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
	prohibits the elimination or limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty.




	        Section 145
	of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
	corporation and certain other persons serving at the request of the corporation in related capacities against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlements
	actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with an action, suit or proceeding to which he or she is or is threatened to be made a party by reason of such position, if such person
	acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, in any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause
	to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of actions brought by or in the right of the corporation, no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or
	matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or other adjudicating court determines that, despite
	the adjudication of liability but in view of all of the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such
	other court shall deem proper.




	        Our
	restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify each person who was or is a party or threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened, pending
	or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of us) by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has
	agreed to become, our director or officer, or is or was serving, or has agreed to serve, at our request as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another
	corporation, partnership, joint




	II-1











	Table of Contents





	venture,
	trust or other enterprise (all such persons being referred to as an "Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
	(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if such
	Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he or she had no
	reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. Our restated certificate of incorporation also provides that we will indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to an action or suit by
	or in the right of us to procure a judgment in our favor by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to become, our director or officer, or is or was serving, or has agreed to
	serve, at our request as a director, officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or by reason
	of any action alleged to have been
	taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with
	such action, suit or proceeding, and any appeal therefrom, if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, our best interests, except
	that no indemnification shall be made with respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to us, unless a court determines that, despite such
	adjudication but in view of all of the circumstances, he or she is entitled to indemnification of such expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any Indemnitee has been successful,
	on the merits or otherwise, he or she will be indemnified by us against all expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her or on his or her behalf in connection
	therewith. If we do not assume the defense, expenses must be advanced to an Indemnitee under certain circumstances.




	        We
	have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. In general, these agreements provide that we will indemnify the director or executive officer
	to the fullest extent permitted by law for claims arising in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company or in connection with their service at our request for another corporation or
	entity. The indemnification agreements also provide for procedures that will apply in the event that a director or executive officer makes a claim for indemnification and establish certain
	presumptions that are favorable to the director or executive officer.




	        We
	maintain a general liability insurance policy that covers certain liabilities of our directors and officers arising out of claims based on acts or omissions in their capacities as
	directors or officers.




	        Certain
	of our non-employee directors may, through their relationships with their employers, be insured and/or indemnified against certain liabilities in their capacity as members of our
	board of directors.




	        The
	underwriting agreement we entered into in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock provides that the underwriters will indemnify, under certain conditions, our
	directors and officers (as well as certain other persons) against certain liabilities arising in connection with such offering.




	        Insofar
	as the forgoing provisions permit indemnification of directors, executive officers, or persons controlling us for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
	or the Securities Act, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is
	therefore unenforceable.














	Item 15.    Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.






	        Set forth below is information regarding shares of our common stock and shares of our preferred stock, and stock options granted, by us within
	the past three years that were not registered under the




	II-2











	Table of Contents





	Securities
	Act. Included is the consideration, if any, we received for such shares and options and information relating to the section of the Securities Act, or rule of the SEC, under which exemption
	from registration was claimed.





	(a)   Issuance of shares of capital stock





	        In connection with preparing for our initial public offering, we effected a one-for-3.75 reverse stock split of our common stock. The reverse stock split became
	effective on June 17, 2016. The par value and authorized shares of preferred stock were not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. The share and per share amounts in this
	section (a) of Item 15 have not been retroactively adjusted to give effect to this reverse stock split.




	        In
	March and August 2014, we issued and sold an aggregate of 15,750,000 shares of our Series A-3 preferred stock at a price per share of $1.00, for an aggregate purchase price of
	$15.8 million.




	        In
	October 2014, we issued and sold an aggregate of 16,893,931 shares of our Series B preferred stock at a price per share of $3.1461, for an aggregate purchase price of
	$53.1 million.




	        In
	January 2016, we issued and sold an aggregate of 12,714,150 shares of our Series B preferred stock at a price per share of $3.1461, for an aggregate purchase price of
	$40.0 million.




	        On
	April 20, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with certain accredited investors (the "Purchasers"), pursuant to which we, in a
	private placement, agreed to issue and sell to the Purchasers 2,592,591 shares of common stock at a price of $13.50 per share for total gross proceeds to the Registrant of approximately
	$35.0 million.




	        No
	underwriters were involved in the foregoing issuances of securities. The securities described in this section (a) of Item 15 were issued to investors in reliance upon
	the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, as set forth in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder relative to
	transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, to the extent an exemption from such registration was required. The recipients of securities in the transactions described above
	represented that they were accredited investors and were acquiring the securities for their own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
	distribution thereof and that they could bear the risks of the investment and could hold the securities for an indefinite period of time and appropriate legends were affixed to the instruments
	representing such securities issued in such transactions.





	(b)   Stock option grants and option exercises





	        From January 1, 2014 through the date of the prospectus that is a part of this registration statement, we granted options to purchase an aggregate of
	3,231,505 shares of common stock, with exercise prices ranging from $1.01 to $15.93 per share, to employees, directors, consultants and advisors pursuant to our equity incentive plans. From
	January 1, 2014 through the filing of our registration statement on Form S-8 on June 30, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 637,923 shares of common stock upon the exercise of
	options for aggregate consideration of $0.8 million.




	        No
	underwriters were involved in the foregoing issuances of securities. The issuances of stock options and the shares of our common stock issued upon the exercise of the options
	described in this paragraph (b) of Item 15 were issued pursuant to written compensatory plans or arrangements with our employees, directors and consultants, in reliance on the exemption
	provided by Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act, or pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act, relative to transactions by an issuer not involving any public
	offering, to the extent an exemption from such registration was required. All recipients either received adequate information about us or had access, through employment or other relationships, to such
	information.

	Item 17.    Undertakings.







	        



	(a)



	   The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:





	        (1)   To
	file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to this Registration Statement:







	(i)




	To
	include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act");






	(ii)




	To
	reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of this Registration Statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment
	thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in this Registration Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in
	the volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum
	offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than
	20 percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee" table in the effective Registration Statement; and






	(iii)




	To
	include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in this Registration Statement or any material change to such
	information in this Registration Statement;










	provided, however



	, that paragraphs (1)(i), (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) do not apply if the information required to be included in a post-effective
	amendment by those paragraphs is contained in periodic reports filed with or furnished to the Commission by the Registrant pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), that are incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement.




	        (2)   That,
	for the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating
	to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at the time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.




	        (3)   To
	remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.





	        



	(b)



	   The Registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each filing of
	the Registrant's annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit plan's annual report pursuant to
	Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act) that is incorporated by reference in this Registration Statement




	II-4











	Table of Contents





	shall
	be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial



	bona fide



	offering thereof.




	        



	(c)



	   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and
	controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the indemnification provisions described herein, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities
	(other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
	asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
	controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by
	the final adjudication of such issue.

	Syros
	Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

	620 Memorial Drive, Suite 300

	Cambridge, MA 02139




	Re:
	Registration Statement on Form S-1




	Ladies
	and Gentlemen:




	        This
	opinion is furnished to you in connection with a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the "Registration Statement") filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
	"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), for the registration of the resale of an aggregate of 2,592,591 shares (the "Shares") of common stock, $0.001 par
	value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Syros Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). All of the Shares are being registered on behalf of certain stockholders of the
	Company (the "Selling Stockholders").




	        We
	are acting as counsel for the Company in connection with the registration for resale of the Shares. We have examined signed copies of the Registration Statement as filed with the
	Commission. We have also examined and relied upon minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Company as provided to us by the Company, the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the
	Company, each as restated and/or amended to date, and such other documents as we have deemed necessary for purposes of rendering the opinions hereinafter set forth.




	        In
	our examination of the foregoing documents, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to
	original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies, the authenticity of the originals of such latter documents and the legal competence of all signatories to such documents.




	        Our
	opinion below, insofar as it relates to the Shares being fully paid, is based solely on a certificate of the Chief Operating Officer of the Company confirming the Company's receipt
	of the consideration called for by the applicable resolutions authorizing the issuance of such Shares.




	        We
	assume that the appropriate action will be taken, prior to the offer and sale of the Shares by the Selling Stockholders, to register and qualify the Shares for sale under all
	applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws.




	        We
	express no opinion herein as to the laws of any state or jurisdiction other than the state laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and the
	federal laws of the United States of America.




	        Based
	upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Shares have been duly authorized for issuance and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. It is
	understood that this opinion is to be used only in connection with the offer and sale of the Shares while the Registration Statement is in effect.

	        Please
	note that we are opining only as to the matters expressly set forth herein, and no opinion should be inferred as to any other matters. This opinion is based upon currently
	existing statutes, rules, regulations and judicial decisions, and we disclaim any obligation to advise you of any change in any of these sources of law or subsequent legal or factual developments
	which might affect any matters or opinions set forth herein.




	        We
	hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as an exhibit to the Registration Statement in accordance with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of
	Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and to the use of our name therein and in the related Prospectus under the caption "Legal Matters." In giving such consent, we do not hereby admit that
	we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission.

Company Overview


Syros Pharmaceuticals is pioneering the understanding of the non-coding region of the genome to advance a new wave of medicines that control expression of disease-driving genes. Syros has built a proprietary platform that is designed to systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, Syros' gene control platform has broad potential to create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across a range of diseases. Syros is currently focused on cancer and immune-mediated diseases and is advancing a growing pipeline of gene control medicines. Syros' lead drug candidates are SY-1425, a selective RARα agonist in a Phase 2 clinical trial for genomically defined subsets of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, and SY-1365, a selective CDK7 inhibitor in a Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with advanced solid tumors, including transcriptionally dependent cancers such as triple negative breast, small cell lung and ovarian cancers. Led by a team with deep experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization, Syros is located in Cambridge, Mass.

An Expression Makes a World of Difference






At Syros, we are pioneering a new area of medicine focused on controlling the expression of genes. The genes expressed - turned on, off, up or down - in any given cell determine its type and function. By creating medicines to control the expression of genes that have gone awry in disease, we aim to make a profound difference in the lives of patients and their families. Join us in understanding the coordinated expression of the Syros team in fulfilling our mission. 
Get to Know us













We Understand How the Expression of Genes Is Controlled

Regulatory regions of the genome control the expression of genes, turning them on, off, up or down, like genomic dimmer switches and determining how a cell behaves, whether it is a skin cell or a lung cell, whether it is normal or diseased. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of all cells, alterations in these regulatory regions contribute to virtually all diseases. But until recently, scientists lacked the tools to study these regulatory regions, rendering them poorly understood and largely unexploited for drug discovery and development.
We have built the first platform dedicated to the regulatory genome to systematically and efficiently identify disease-causing alterations in gene expression and develop medicines that control the expression of genes with the aim of providing a profound and durable benefit for patients with diseases that have largely eluded other genomics-based approaches. Learn about our Gene Control Platform

Expressions Beyond Ourselves
The coordinated expression of the Syros team reaches well beyond our walls. From raising money for patient support groups to keeping it green at Syros, caring for our community is part of our DNA. In addition to participating in official events and corporate challenges, we like to infuse our philanthropy with a little fun, holding "fun-raisers" like our very own C-suite Lab Olympics, wine & whiskey tasting dinners and various money challenges throughout the year to raise needed funds for causes that make a difference in people's lives. We care for each other and for the environment, and we're proud to be among the top corporate fund-raising teams for the Lymphoma & Leukemia's Boston chapter, The Prouty and Bio-Ball, and on the leader board for our participation in the Green Streets Initiative Corporate Challenge to improve our health, community and environment one commute at a time.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 4,000,000 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be $43.5 million, or $50.5 million if
the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us.

As of March 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $62.1 million. We
currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to fund our proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical 
  trial of SY-1425 in AML and MDS, including clinical research outsourcing, drug
  manufacturing, companion diagnostic development and internal personnel costs,
  with costs to be approximately allocated based on the number of AML and MDS 
  patients enrolled in this trial, respectively;

• approximately $20.0 million to complete our IND-enabling activities and the 
  Phase 1 portion of our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial for SY-1365, including
  clinical research outsourcing, drug manufacturing and internal personnel 
  costs;

• approximately $40.0 million for new and ongoing research activities, including
  for our preclinical programs and our platform with a goal of systematically 
  delivering additional INDs; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash 
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and 
business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our 
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents. We have no
current agreements, commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions
or licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, we estimate
that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to reach clinical activity data
readouts for SY-1425 in AML and MDS and SY-1365 in acute leukemias and to fund
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least through
mid-2018. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong,
and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently
expect. We do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund the
completion of development of any of our product candidates.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and 
U.S. government securities.


The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly
advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary
products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and
scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential
competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical,
specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and
governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product
candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with
existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other
related markets that address gene control and cancer. There are other companies
working to develop therapies in the fields of gene control and cancer. These
companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology
companies of various sizes.

The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation
and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug 
therapy. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In
many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. 
While our product candidates may compete with many existing drug and other 
therapies, they may also be used in combination with or as an adjunct to these 
therapies. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject
to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these
approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by 
physicians, patients and third-party payors. In general, although there has been
considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer and 
the currently marketed therapies provide benefits to many patients, these
therapies all are limited to some extent in their efficacy and frequency of
adverse events. As a result, the level of morbidity and mortality from cancer
remains high.

In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of 
medicines in late stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in
development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that
are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide
significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain
market approval.

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and
expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing,
conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing 
approved medicines than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, 
biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being
concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also
compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management
personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for 
clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or 
necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to
be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with
large and established companies.

The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product
candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience,
price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics in guiding the use of related
therapeutics, the level of generic competition and the availability of
reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors
develop and commercialize medicines that are safer, more effective, have fewer
or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any
medicines that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other
regulatory approval for their medicines more rapidly than we may obtain approval
for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market
position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to
compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors
seeking to encourage the use of generic medicines. There are many generic
medicines currently on the market for the indications that we are pursuing, and
additional medicines are expected to become available on a generic basis over
the coming years. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect
that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic
medicines.

If the drug candidates of our priority programs are approved for the indications
for which we are currently planning clinical trials, they will compete with the
drugs discussed below and will likely compete with other drugs currently in 
development.

SY-1425

We plan to initially develop SY-1425, our RAR† agonist, for patients with AML or
MDS. We will select patients for our clinical trials based on high-levels of 
RAR† as measured by our proprietary biomarker. There has been little advancement
in treatment options for patients with these cancers. Typical treatment includes
chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation. SY-1425 may face competition
from other drug candidates currently in clinical development for relapsed or 
refractory AML and MDS. Several companies are developing drugs for AML, 
including Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Agios 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Novartis AG, Astellas Pharma Inc. and Karyopharm 
Therapeutics Inc. We believe that SY-1425 will be the only selective RAR† 
agonist in clinical development for relapsed or refractory AML in North America
and Europe. Because the mechanism of action is different than the others 
currently on the market and in development, we believe that SY-1425 could be 
first-in-class and could be used in combination with other therapies, which 
could minimize competition, assuming that data from a registration-enabling
trial warrants such use. We are aware of only one other selective RAR† program,
being pursued by IO Therapeutics, Inc. This program appears to be in clinical
development.

SY-1365

We plan to initially develop SY-1365, our CDK7 inhibitor, for patients with
relapsed or refractory AML or recurrent or refractory ALL.

The competitive landscape for AML is described above. In ALL, patients are
typically treated with older chemotherapeutics. Targeted therapies such as
kinase inhibitors, including imatinib and dasatinib, and monoclonal antibodies,
including rituximab and blinatumamab, have been developed and used successfully
for certain patient populations within ALL. If SY-1365 receives marketing
approval, it may face competition from other drug candidates currently in
development for relapsed and refractory ALL from several companies including
Amgen Inc., Novartis and Juno Therapeutics, Inc.

We believe that SY-1365 will be the only selective mechanism of its kind in
clinical development. Because the mechanism of action is different than the
others currently on the market and in development, we believe that it could be
first-in-class and used in combination with other therapies, which could
minimize competition, assuming that data from a registration-enabling trial
warrants such use. We are aware of two other selective CDK7 inhibitor programs,
both of which appear to be in early preclinical development.


Company Description
We are a biopharmaceutical company pioneering an understanding of the region
of the genome controlling the activation and repression of genes. Our goal is to
advance a new wave of medicines to control the expression of disease-driving
genes. We have built a proprietary gene control platform


 designed to
systematically and efficiently analyze this unexploited region of DNA in human
disease tissue to identify and drug novel targets linked to genomically defined
patient populations. Because gene expression is fundamental to the function of
all cells, we believe that our gene control platform has broad potential to
create medicines that achieve profound and durable benefit across therapeutic
areas and a range of diseases. By focusing on genomically defined subsets of
patients, we believe we can conduct efficient clinical trials with a higher
likelihood of success. We are currently focused on developing treatments for
cancer and immune-mediated diseases and are building a pipeline of gene control
medicines. We plan to begin a Phase 2 clinical trial for our lead product
candidate, SY-1425 (tamibarotene), in mid-2016. This trial will enroll
genomically defined subsets of patients with relapsed or refractory acute
myelogenous leukemia, or AML, and relapsed high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome,
or MDS. We plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for our development
candidate SY-1365, initially for the treatment of acute leukemia, in the first
half of 2017. Both of these programs may have potential in additional
indications. Using our platform, we are also generating a pipeline of novel
preclinical drug candidates for genomically defined subsets of currently
underserved patients. Our goal is to build a fully integrated biopharmaceutical
company based on our leadership position in gene control.

There are approximately 200 different cell types in the human body. Despite
having identical genomes, each of these cell types has a different function. For
example, a skin cell functions differently from a muscle cell despite sharing
the exact same DNA. What determines a cell's type and function is the specific
set of genes that is expressed, or turned "on" or "off," in that particular
cell. This coordinated activation and repression of genes, known as the cell's
gene expression program, is controlled by non-coding regions of the genome.
Alterations in these non-coding regions change a cell's gene expression program,
altering its normal function and leading to disease. Because this biology is
fundamental to the function of all cells, it applies across diseases, whether
the cause is genetic, environmental, bacterial, viral or multi-factorial.

Although researchers have long believed that alterations in non-coding regions 
of DNA, which account for 98% of the genome, play a key role in driving disease,
the scientific community has lacked the tools to study these regions of the 
genome, rendering them poorly understood. As a result, the discovery and 
development of targeted therapies to date has focused almost exclusively on
abnormal proteins resulting from genetic alterations found in regions of DNA
that encode for proteins, which represent less than 2% of the entire genome.

While targeted therapies, in which the right drug is matched to the right
patient, have dramatically improved the ability to treat certain cancers and
other serious diseases, the identification of new drug targets by sequencing
coding regions of DNA has been largely exhausted. Moreover, in cancer, 
inhibiting abnormal proteins resulting from single genetic alterations can often
lead to drug resistance and limited durable clinical benefit. Furthermore, many
serious diseases continue to go unaddressed due to the limitations of current
drug discovery approaches. Taken together, these factors underscore the need for
fundamentally new approaches to drug discovery and development.

Based on the work of our scientific founders, we believe we have developed the 
first proprietary platform designed to systematically and efficiently analyze 
non-coding regions of the genome in healthy and diseased cells taken from 
patient tissues to identify alterations in gene expression programs that
represent optimal points of therapeutic intervention and develop drugs to
control the expression of disease-driving genes. By doing so, we believe our
gene control platform will allow us to (i) identify a wide array of potential
new drug targets across a range of diseases, (ii) provide a new lens for
diagnosing and segmenting patients, including those with complex,
multi-factorial diseases that have eluded segmentation with other genomic-based
approaches, and (iii) advance a new wave of medicines that have the potential to
influence multiple drivers of disease through a single target, making them less
susceptible to drug resistance and providing patients with a more profound and
durable benefit than many of today's targeted therapies.

In contrast to therapies that target a single abnormal protein, gene control
medicines target alterations in the cell's underlying gene expression program,
modulating the coordinated expression of the crucial set of genes that
contribute to disease. The relatively few gene control medicines available today
are among the most important targeted therapies and are widely used for their
approved indications. These drugs, including estrogen receptor inhibitors for
breast cancer, androgen receptor inhibitors for prostate cancer and
glucocorticoids for inflammatory diseases, illustrate the significant
therapeutic potential of gene control medicines. However, the poor understanding
of non-coding regions of DNA has historically prevented a systematic approach to
identifying these critical points of therapeutic intervention, making gene
control a largely untapped field for targeted drug discovery and development.

We believe that we have created a systematic and efficient approach to analyzing
non-coding regions of the genome in human disease tissue to identify and drug 
novel targets linked to genomically defined patient populations. Our proprietary
gene control platform consists of two fundamental pillars: identifying novel 
gene control targets linked to genomically defined patient populations, and 
drugging gene control targets.

Identifying Novel Gene Control Targets

Starting from human tissue samples, we compare diseased cells to normal cells 
and analyze the cells of different patient subsets within a disease to
systematically and efficiently identify alterations in gene expression programs
that represent optimal points of therapeutic intervention and associated
biomarkers for patient selection. We home in on a cell's gene expression program
by using genomic tools to locate super-enhancers, which are highly specialized
regions of non-coding DNA that are central to orchestrating gene expression
programs and drive the increased expression of the genes crucial to the function
of a given cell. Analysis of super-enhancers and their associated genes provides
critical insights into changes in gene expression programs that contribute to
disease. We have invested significant resources in our tissue processing,
genomics and computational biology capabilities to industrialize the analysis of
gene expression programs to reveal the genes crucial to cell type and function
in diseased cells. We have amassed one of the largest known datasets of gene
expression programs across a wide range of human diseases and cell types and
have validated multiple novel disease targets and biomarkers. To date, we have
analyzed or are in the process of analyzing gene expression programs in AML,
breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer,
renal cell carcinoma, non-disease and lupus immune cells, polycystic kidney
disease, spinal muscular atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. Through those efforts,
we have identified approximately 50 novel drug targets in oncology, 
immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases and validated seven of those targets 
using biological methods to knock out the target gene or chemical methods to 
modulate the target's activity. The discovery and validation of these targets 
has led to the identification of our product candidate SY-1425 as well as 
additional novel preclinical drug candidates in earlier stages of research and 
development. We plan to analyze gene expression programs in several other 
cancers, including colorectal, lung and melanoma, as well as several other 
diseases and cell types including additional inflammatory disorders and immune 
cells from tumors. Our long-term goal is to analyze gene expression programs in
serious diseases where we believe currently underserved patients can benefit 
from gene control medicines.

Drugging Gene Control Targets

Our platform is designed to identify drug targets across a broad range of
therapeutic areas and therapeutic modalities. We focus our internal drug
discovery efforts on small molecule chemistry to target specialized proteins
responsible for gene expression, including transcription factors,
transcriptional kinases and other transcriptional and regulatory proteins, for
several reasons. First, because these specialized proteins play a central role
in implementing gene expression programs, they are among the most promising and
high-potential gene control targets for therapeutic intervention. Transcription
factors bind directly to DNA sequences to control the transcription of genetic
information from DNA. Transcription factors perform this function with other
transcriptional and regulatory proteins, including transcriptional kinases.
Second, transcriptional and regulatory proteins have historically been difficult
to drug and represent an opportunity to bring novel and differentiated therapies
to patients. Third, we have built a differentiated combination of expertise,
tools and capabilities that we believe will give us cutting-edge insights into
drugging transcriptional and regulatory proteins. Through significant
investments in developing our capabilities in biochemistry, structural biology
and medicinal chemistry and in developing a sophisticated suite of proprietary
assays, which are internally developed tests that we use to measure the
biochemical, biophysical, cellular and genomic activity of known and novel
compounds against gene control targets, we believe we will be able to overcome
challenges that have prevented others from systematically and successfully
developing gene control medicines. We are building a pipeline of product
candidates to modulate gene expression programs through two distinct approaches:
internal efforts to discover novel drugs against our validated gene control
targets, and externally focused efforts to link existing drugs to novel
genomically defined patient populations identified through our platform. These
externally focused efforts could enable us to identify drugs that we may seek to
in-license or acquire or use as starting points for our own drug discovery and
development programs to accelerate our development path.

We are leveraging our platform to develop a pipeline of gene control product
candidates. By focusing on genomically defined subsets of patients who are most
likely to respond, we believe we will conduct efficient clinical trials and
rapidly achieve clinical proof-of-concept. With positive clinical results in
areas of unmet medical need, we intend to apply for Breakthrough Therapy
designation and Fast Track designation which, if granted, could accelerate our 
clinical development path. Our most advanced drug programs are summarized in the
table below:

SY-1425

SY-1425 (tamibarotene) is an oral, potent and selective agonist, or activator, 
of the transcription factor RAR†. We leveraged our platform to analyze gene 
expression programs in primary AML and breast cancer patient tumor cells and 
discovered that RARA, the gene that codes for RAR†, was associated with a 
super-enhancer in some patients' tumors but not in others. We also identified a
proprietary biomarker, which we refer to as the RARA biomarker, related to the 
super-enhancer associated with RARA. The super-enhancer associated with RARA is
believed to lock cells in an immature, proliferative and undifferentiated state.
Treatment with SY-1425 in cancer cells with the super-enhancer associated with
RARA appears to promote differentiation of these cells.

We are initially advancing SY-1425 into novel genomically defined patient
populations with AML and MDS. We chose these initial indications due to high
levels of observed efficacy of SY-1425 in our preclinical models, the
significant unmet medical need of these patients and the potential for
accelerated development. We intend to pursue additional indications, including
breast cancer, in the near future. We plan to use our RARA biomarker for patient
selection.

We have the exclusive North American and European commercial rights to the
existing preclinical data for SY-1425 in all human cancers under our license
agreement with TMRC Co., Ltd. SY-1425 is approved as tamibarotene in Japan for
the treatment of APL, a form of AML, for which the drug has a well-characterized
efficacy and safety profile. We intend to explore the development of SY-1425 for
the treatment of APL in North America and Europe.

Our Preclinical Data

We have conducted multiple preclinical studies of SY-1425 in AML and breast
cancer. In a mouse model implanted with human AML cells with the RARA biomarker,
known as a RARA biomarker-positive patient-derived xenograft, or PDX, model,
SY-1425 was observed to have significant anti-tumor activity and prolonged
survival in treated animals relative to untreated animals. In contrast, in a PDX
model with human AML cells without the RARA biomarker, SY-1425 was not observed
to have an effect on tumor control or survival. These data demonstrate a strong
link between the RARA biomarker and response to treatment with SY-1425, and 
provide meaningful evidence that patients with the RARA biomarker will be 
promising candidates for treatment with SY-1425.

SY-1425 Clinical Development Plan

We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in mid-2016 that will enroll
genomically defined subsets of patients with relapsed or refractory AML or
relapsed high-risk MDS. In May 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA, accepted our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for this trial.
We plan to select patients for this trial using the RARA biomarker. We believe
patients whose tumors have this biomarker will be more likely to experience a
profound and durable clinical benefit from treatment with SY-1425. We expect to
have initial data from this study in mid-2017, or 12 months after the first
patient is enrolled. We also plan to evaluate SY-1425 in newly diagnosed AML
patients 60 years of age or older who are not suitable candidates for standard
chemotherapy and low-risk transfusion-dependent MDS patients. In order to
prospectively select patients in these populations using our RARA biomarker, we
will seek clearance for the use of the biomarker test from the FDA through the
Investigational Device Exemption process.

SY-1365

SY-1365 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of the
transcriptional kinase known as cyclin-dependent kinase 7, or CDK7. We are
investigating SY-1365 for the treatment of cancers that are dependent on a high
and constant expression of certain transcription factors for their growth and
survival, a phenomenon known as transcriptional addiction. CDK7 is a
transcriptional kinase that is associated with super-enhancers controlling the
expression of the transcription factors driving these cancers' growth and
survival.

Inhibiting CDK7 preferentially lowers the expression of disease-driving genes 
controlled by super-enhancers, including oncogenic transcription factors MYB and
MYC, and results in the selective killing of cancer cells over non-cancerous 
cells. Preclinical studies of our CDK7 inhibitors demonstrated that 
transcriptionally addicted cancers are particularly sensitive to selective
inhibition of CDK7, including AML, T-ALL, a form of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, or ALL, MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer and
triple negative breast cancer.

Our Preclinical Data

SY-1365 has shown promising efficacy and safety in our in vivo and in vitro
preclinical studies. In terms of efficacy, SY-1365 was observed to have complete
responses and survival benefit in cell-derived xenograft, or CDX, and PDX models
of AML. In one such study, mice treated with SY-1365 experienced initial
clearance of the disease and maintained residual low levels of human leukemia
cells. In fact, 80% of treated mice remained alive and levels of human leukemia
cells in the blood remained at less than 5% beyond the dosing period. By
contrast, in untreated mice, the cancer progressed, reaching levels of human
leukemia cells of greater than 50% in blood and greater than 90% in tissues.

In terms of selectivity and safety, in cell lines, SY-1365 was observed to
preferentially kill cancer cells by inducing robust, sustained and
dose-dependent apoptosis of AML cells with minimal impact on non-cancerous
cells. In addition, SY-1365 was observed to have markedly fewer negative effects
on healthy cells than a pan-CDK inhibitor. Pan-CDK inhibitors have been observed
to result in blood cell death, or myelosuppression.

SY-1365 Clinical Development Plan

We have begun IND-enabling activities for SY-1365, and our goal is to initiate a
Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with acute leukemia, including AML and ALL,
in the first half of 2017. We expect to have initial data from this study in the
first half of 2018. We believe there is a well-defined path to clinical
proof-of-concept in acute leukemia. We then plan to expand into a broader set of
cancers using our platform to identify patient subsets with transcriptionally 
addicted cancers, such as small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer
and MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma. We continue to explore the potential of CDK7 
inhibition in additional cancers.

We are using our platform to analyze gene expression programs across additional
cancers, inflammatory diseases and other diseases to identify optimal points of
therapeutic intervention in specific subsets of patients and to create a 
pipeline of novel preclinical drug candidates targeting transcriptional and
regulatory proteins, as well as to link existing drugs to novel genomically
defined patient populations.

We were founded by leaders in the field of gene control from the Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
