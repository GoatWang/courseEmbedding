                    Triloma Continues Growth, Signs Lease for Additional Office Space
                




                  ORLANDO, Fla. (March 15, 2017) – Triloma, a Winter Park, Florida-based private investment management firm, announced today it has leased an additional 9,500 square feet of space in its current downtown Winter Park office building, bringing its total office space to over 17,000 square feet.
                


                    “Having this additional space available will allow us to accommodate our growing team,” explained managing director, Mike Wood. “More importantly, it affirms our commitment to Winter Park, and we’re excited for what the future holds for us here.”
                  

                    To accommodate its rapidly growing team, Triloma has expanded its offices three times since initially leasing 1,763 square feet of space on Park Avenue in late 2013. One of the ways the firm seeks to promote a healthy work/life balance for its associates is by keeping daily commutes as short as possible, which ultimately led Triloma to its current building just a block away on New York Avenue.
                  

                    Triloma now has 58 associates, each averaging 16 years of investment industry experience. The firm has two public investment offerings currently available, and will continue to offer a series of private investment opportunities this year. Additionally, Triloma intends to introduce new products for 2017 in response to the ever-changing investment and regulatory environments.
                  

                    This announcement comes on the heels of Triloma reporting more than $200 million in equity capital raised in 2016, as well as plans for continued growth and increased involvement in industry advocacy in 2017.

                  ORLANDO, FL. (Jan. 18, 2017) – Triloma, a Winter Park, Florida-based private investment management firm, announced today it raised more than $200 million in equity capital in 2016 – its first full year of operations.
                


                    “Having the alternative investment industry entrust us with over $200 million in capital is a remarkable achievement for our first full year of operations,” said Larry Goff, chief executive officer of Triloma Securities, “and we are grateful to our extraordinary team for all their hard work and efforts getting us to this milestone. We continue to make it our priority as a firm to improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates, and we believe our success to be a direct result of this focus.”
                  

                    In 2017, the firm plans to continue to expand its selling syndicate for the Triloma EIG Energy Income Funds, add additional talent to its operations teams, and further diversify its platform of products.
                  

                    Triloma also will increase its involvement in the Investment Program Association (IPA), the financial service industry’s leading education and advocacy body for Direct Investment programs. The IPA has announced the appointment of Triloma managing director Nathan Headrick as chair-elect of the board, assuming the position of chair in 2018.

                    “Triloma is the youngest sponsor ever to provide this level of leadership to the IPA.

                    Triloma Continues Strategic Expansion of Team
                



Investment management company adds three members to Triloma Energy Advisors

                  WINTER PARK, Fla. (Mar 21, 2016) – Triloma Financial Group, the private investment management firm headquartered in Winter Park, announced today the addition of Elizabeth Strouse, Elizabeth Ortiz and Minerva Rodriguez as chief financial officer, fund controller and fund accounting manager, respectively, of Triloma Energy Advisors.
                

Each of the three new hires has been carefully selected to support the anticipated growth in assets for Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I, which are advised by Triloma Energy Advisors. Collectively, they bring decades of experience to the burgeoning investment management company.
Elizabeth Strouse, who will serve as CFO of Triloma Energy Advisors, has extensive accounting, administration and financial reporting experience in the investment management industry. Prior to joining Triloma, Ms. Strouse served as managing director of State Street Corp, and was primarily responsible for helping the company’s key asset management clients navigate the complex regulatory environment. From 2009 to 2014, Ms. Strouse served as chief accounting officer of Transamerica Asset Management providing oversight for approximately $70 billion of assets under management within approximately 190 registered funds, including serving as the principal financial officer, chairman of the valuation committee, and member of various risk committees. In addition to her role as CFO of Triloma Energy Advisors, Ms. Strouse was appointed CFO of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I.
Elizabeth Ortiz brings broad investment company accounting and financial reporting experience to her position as fund controller of Triloma Energy Advisors. In her new role, Ms. Ortiz will provide accounting and administration services to the Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds. Prior to joining Triloma, Ms. Ortiz spent over 14 years at BNY Mellon, and was most recently responsible for the preparation of investment company financial statements for several clients (Voya, CBRE, DBX, CurrencyShares, among others) including regulatory SEC filings. Her responsibilities at BNY Mellon included a variety of roles across the mutual fund accounting division, with experience managing internal senior staff accountants and communicating with third-party clients or custodians.
Minerva Rodriguez will serve as fund accounting manager of Triloma Energy Advisors, supporting the accounting and administration of the Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds. Ms. Rodriguez is a seasoned accounting professional with over 20 years of experience in financial management. Prior to joining Triloma, Ms. Rodriguez spent 14 years at BNY Mellon, and was most recently responsible for all aspects of fund accounting, daily processing, valuation of net assets, preparation of regulatory SEC filings, and reporting of domestic and global equity securities, fixed income securities, term loans, derivatives and complex financial instruments.
“We are thrilled to welcome Liz, Elizabeth and Minerva to our growing team,” said Deryck Harmer, president and CEO of Triloma Energy Advisors. “Triloma is focused on providing best-in-class support and service, and the collective experience they bring to our group is a terrific asset as we ramp up investment operations for the energy funds.”

                    Triloma Announces 2015 Growth Activity
                




Investment firm exceeds equity raising goals in its first year of operations

                  ORLANDO, Fla. (Feb. 17, 2016) – Triloma Securities (“Triloma”) announced today the results of its syndication activity in 2015. The firm, which commenced broker-dealer operations on April 23, 2015, surpassed its equity raising goals for the year in just over eight months.
                


                    In 2015, Triloma raised more than $117 million in equity in 12 offerings, marking one of the quickest sponsor launches in the alternative investment industry to-date. As part of its capital raising efforts, Triloma signed 57 selling agreements with 23
                    different retail broker-dealer firms throughout the year, with investment offerings in energy, seniors housing and land development.
                  

                    “When we founded Triloma, our goal was to create a company where we could improve the lives of our investors, partners and associates,” said Larry Goff, chief executive officer of Triloma Securities. “As we look back at an extraordinary first year for
                    our firm, we have exceeded that goal. We are also proud to have three outstanding investment partners, and to have added to our team some of the brightest and most experienced professionals in our industry.”
                  

                    In the last year, Triloma and its affiliate, Triloma Financial Group, have grown from 9 to 46 associates. These associates include industry veterans who average 15 years of experience in the investment industry. To accommodate this strategic
                    growth, the company relocated to a larger office in Winter Park, Florida.
                  

                    Plans for continued growth in 2016 are well underway, as Triloma prepares to expand its presence in the broker-dealer community.

Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund

                                      Energy is one of the largest components of GDP globally, characterized by dynamic international capital and trade flows. The global and interconnected nature of the energy markets require active management and industry expertise to manage these complex investments.
                                    

                                      Expand Your Portfolio
                                    

                                      Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund (the “Perpetual Fund”) provides investors the opportunity to access a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. We believe an investment allocation in tangible real assets has long been recognized as a way to add complementary diversification to a portfolio concentrated in stocks and bonds. Under normal circumstances, the Perpetual Fund will invest at least 80 percent of its total assets in debt and equity investments of energy companies and projects. Through an investment focused on energy companies and projects, investors may gain access to a core real assets category with the potential for attractive income and a low correlation with other asset classes.
                                    

                                      An Alternative Income Strategy
                                    

                                    The Perpetual Fund’s investment objective is primarily to provide shareholders with current income; as secondary investment objectives, the Fund will seek to provide capital preservation and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. While there can be no assurance that the Perpetual Fund will achieve its investment objectives, we believe investing in senior and subordinated debt of energy companies and projects offers opportunities for risk-adjusted returns and income generation. Further, a portfolio broadly allocated among issuers, energy industry sub-sectors and geographies may reduce the risk of a downturn in any single investment having a disproportionate adverse impact on the portfolio value.
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund will provide increased interim liquidity through a share repurchase program allowing it to be externally managed and continuously offered indefinitely. Pursuant to its share repurchase program, it intends to conduct quarterly tender offers on approximately 20 percent of its weighted average number of outstanding shares in any 12-month period.
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund is managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company.
                                    

                                      Differentiated by Global Opportunities
                                    

                                      The Perpetual Fund will invest on a global basis primarily in companies and projects located in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia and Latin America. The Perpetual Fund intends to invest a significant portion of its assets in companies and projects located outside the United States. The Perpetual Fund expects that a substantial portion of its portfolio will consist of senior and subordinated debt, which may take the form of corporate or project loans or bonds, may be secured or unsecured and may, in some cases, be accompanied by yield enhancements. The portfolio is expected to include primarily floating-rate investments that provide protection in rising interest rate and inflationary environments. The Perpetual Fund’s primary areas of focus will be the upstream, midstream, and power sub-sectors of the energy industry. However, EIG has the experience and technical expertise to invest across the energy value chain on a global basis. The Perpetual Fund’s advisors broadly define the targeted energy company and project investment sub-sectors as follows: (i) upstream; (ii) midstream; (iii) downstream; (iv) power; (v) renewables; (vi) resources; (vii) infrastructure and (viii) other energy.

Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund

                                        Investing in the Triloma EIG Energy Income Fund (the “Perpetual Fund”) involves risks, including the risk that a shareholder may receive little or no return on its investment or that shareholder may lose part or all of its investment. The following is a list of some of the important risks factors that prospective investors should consider prior to making a decision to invest in the Perpetual Fund. The list is not intended to be comprehensive or exhaustive. Various other risks also apply; therefore, current and prospective shareholders should read and fully understand the prospectus, which is available here.
                                    
Liquidity Risks

An investment in the Perpetual Fund is not suitable for an investor who needs access to the money they invest;
A shareholder should consider that they may not have access to the money they invest for an indefinite period of time;
Unlike most closed-end funds, the shares are not listed on any securities exchange, and shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their shares regardless of how the Perpetual Fund performs;
If a shareholder is able to sell their shares, the shareholder may receive less than their purchase price and the then-current net asset value per share;
Although the Perpetual Fund has implemented a share repurchase program, it may be discontinued at any time and only 5 percent of outstanding shares will be eligible for repurchase per quarter;

Energy Sector Risks

The Perpetual Fund’s investments in energy companies expose the Perpetual Fund to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Perpetual Fund than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries;
Energy companies are subject to significant foreign, federal, state and local regulation in virtually every aspect of their operations, and their profitability could be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment;
There is an inherent risk that energy companies may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle, and the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the compliance costs of energy companies and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary;
Some energy companies may be subject to construction risk, development risk, acquisition risk or other risks arising from their strategies to expand operations through new construction or development activities, expanding operations through acquisitions, or securing additional long-term contracts;

Investment Risks

The Perpetual Fund’s investments in various types of debt securities and instruments may be secured, unsecured, rated or unrated, are subject to non-payment risk, and may be speculative in nature;
Increases in interest rates may cause the Perpetual Fund’s investments in fixed-rate debt securities to decline in value;
Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations;
Subordinated investments in debt have lower priority in right of payment to any higher-ranking obligations of the borrower, and the cash flows and assets of the borrower may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to any higher-ranking obligations of the borrower;
During periods of declining interest rates, borrowers or issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, which could reduce income and returns;
Below investment grade instruments (commonly referred to as “high-yield” securities or “junk bonds”) may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns, which could cause losses. Most investments in which the Perpetual Fund invests will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would be rated as below investment grade quality. Investments rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing distress involve a substantial degree of risk, require a high level of analytical sophistication for successful investment and require active monitoring;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in expectation of a specific event or catalyst can result in losses if the event or catalyst fails to occur or it does not have the expected effect or does not occur in the expected timeframe;
The Perpetual Fund may invest in illiquid and restricted securities that may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price;
The valuation of securities or instruments that lack a central trading place (such as fixed-income securities or instruments) may carry greater risk than those which trade on an exchange;
The value of convertible securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, as well as the market price and volatility of the underlying security;
The value of equity securities may fluctuate in response to factors affecting the particular company in which the Perpetual Fund invests, as well as broader market and economic conditions;
The Perpetual Fund’s investments in derivatives have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Perpetual Fund;
Leverage could create the opportunity for higher income and returns for shareholders, but can magnify the effect of any losses;
Triloma, EIG and certain of their affiliates have conflicts of interest in connection with the management of the Perpetual Fund;
The Perpetual Fund is a recently organized, non-diversified, closed-end investment company with no operating history;

Non-U.S. Investment Risks

The Perpetual Fund may be materially adversely affected by market, economic and political conditions globally and in the jurisdictions and sectors in which the Perpetual Fund invests;
Investments in certain securities or other instruments of non-U.S. issuers or borrowers (“Non-U.S. Securities”) may involve factors not typically associated with investing in the U.S. or other developed countries;
Non-U.S. Securities may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility, illiquidity and changes in value than U.S. securities;
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of and returns on foreign denominated investments;
Credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system (e.g., the “shadow banking system”) could result in increased regulatory and operating costs, which could adversely affect the implementation of the Perpetual Fund’s investment strategies and its income and returns;

Legal and Regulatory Risks

To qualify and remain eligible for the special tax treatment accorded to regulated investment companies (“RIC”) and their shareholders under the Internal Revenue Code, the Perpetual Fund must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements, and failure to do so could result in the loss of RIC status;
The Perpetual Fund’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Perpetual Fund for investment. Any capital returned to shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. Distributions may also be funded in significant part from the waiver of certain expenses that will be subject to future repayment by the Perpetual Fund, thus reducing the amounts available for distribution to future shareholders; and
Legal and regulatory changes, such as those implemented in connection with The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as amended (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), could occur, which may materially adversely affect the Perpetual Fund.

Accordingly, the Perpetual Fund should be considered a speculative investment that entails substantial risks, and a prospective investor should invest in the Perpetual Fund only if they can sustain a complete loss of their investment.

1The public offering price is effective as of the weekly close beginning July 26, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the prospectus, the public offering price is subject to change based on fluctuations in net asset value (NAV). Please refer to the Perpetual Fund’s current prospectus as amended and supplemented for disclosures related to the public offering price.
                        

2Beginning August 1, 2017. The current annualized distribution rate is calculated by dividing the annualized distributions by the current public offering price. The Perpetual Fund’s distributions will be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which could constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Perpetual Fund for investment. There is no assurance that distributions will be sustained at current levels.
                        

3For illustrative purposes only. The objectives are not guarantees, predictions or projections of future performance and there is no assurance they will be met.

Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds has named Hope Newsome as chief compliance officer. Currently, Newsome is chief compliance officer of Triloma Energy Advisors, the Funds’ adviser and secretary.
PRESS RELEASE
WINTER PARK, FL–(Marketwired – October 20, 2016) – The board of Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I and Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund (together, the “Funds”) announced today the appointment of Hope Newsome as chief compliance officer of the Funds. Until now, the Funds have relied on third-party compliance to help ensure their adherence to applicable regulatory requirements. With this appointment, the Funds will now have a full-time, dedicated chief compliance officer responsible for developing, administering and enforcing the Funds’ policies and procedures.
Newsome joined Triloma Securities in 2015, having spent four years as chief compliance officer of Newport Group Securities, a FINRA registered broker-dealer and SEC registered investment adviser. Prior to Newport Group, she held the positions of general counsel and chief compliance officer at International Assets Advisory, LLC, and as director of business practices and controls at AXA Equitable where she led a controls team that managed the review of more than 2,000 financial professionals across the United States.
Newsome currently serves as chief compliance officer of Triloma Energy Advisors, the Funds’ advisor, and secretary of the Funds, making her a natural choice for CCO of the Funds. “Hope’s knowledge of regulatory requirements, natural gift for practical execution of compliance activities, and her sharp business acumen make her more than just a compliance officer, but a true leader within the Funds,” said Deryck Harmer, president and chief executive officer of the Funds. 





The announcement comes less than one month after Sara Searle was named chief compliance officer for Triloma Securities. Searle plans to add two more members to her compliance team before year end as part of the firm’s continued strategic growth efforts.

Triloma EIG Global Energy Funds Declared Effective by the SEC 








August 4, 2015










































ORLANDO, FL and WASHINGTON, DC--(Marketwired - Aug 4, 2015) -  Triloma Financial Group ("Triloma") and EIG Global Energy Partners ("EIG") announce that registration statements pertaining to an initial public offering of $2 billion in common stock of Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I (the "Funds") are now effective.
The Funds are unlisted investment companies that will invest primarily in a global portfolio of privately originated energy company and project debt. 
The Funds are managed by Triloma Energy Advisors and EIG Credit Management Company and seek to raise capital with the issuance of common stock through a best efforts, continuous public offering.
"We are thrilled to bring this unique product to market," said Barry Goff, managing director of Triloma. "We believe EIG's singular focus in providing capital to energy companies and energy-related infrastructure and resource projects represents a significant competitive advantage for the Funds relative to other energy capital providers."
"Our 33-years of experience in the energy sector give us confidence that now is an attractive time to create the Funds to take advantage of the energy market fundamentals," said R. Blair Thomas, chief executive officer of EIG. "The demand for capital in the sector is vast, and EIG is uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities this demand creates due to our global platform, track record, and ability to invest in all aspects of the energy value chain."

We believe this new solution of customized liquidity provisions will be well received by the market in light of the current regulatory and competitive environment."

The transaction was originated, negotiated and structured by EIG Global Energy Partners, on behalf of its managed investment vehicles and as sub-advisor to the Funds.Crown is a privately held company located in Midland, Texas, that is focused on acquiring and developing oil and natural gas exploration properties primarily in the northern Delaware Basin region, which is the western part of the larger Permian Basin. The notes, which mature in 2019, are floating rate and secured by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the assets of Crown.Previously, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission granted the Funds an order for exemptive relief, allowing them to co-invest in portfolio companies with each other and with affiliated investment funds. The Crown investment is the first time the Funds have participated in a directly originated investment transaction alongside EIG's private funds."The investment in Crown is a great example of how we will leverage EIG's global sourcing and origination platform to directly access opportunities that are not generally available to the broader market," said Deryck Harmer, president and CEO of the Funds.A full holdings report of the Funds' respective portfolios will be disclosed in their next quarterly N-Q filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.About Triloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund ITriloma EIG Global Energy Fund and Triloma EIG Global Energy Term Fund I are unlisted investment companies that invest primarily in global portfolios of privately originated energy company and project debt.

Investments in senior secured debt present additional risks, including that there is a higher risk of default than with investment-grade bonds. Generally, investments in debt securities with longer-term maturities are subject to greater volatility than investments in shorter-term obligations. The Funds' investments in energy companies expose the Funds to risks associated with adverse economic, environmental or regulatory occurrences affecting the energy sector, a higher volatility of the market and a downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Funds than on funds that are broadly diversified across many sectors and industries.This press release may contain forward-looking statements identified by the use of words such as "outlook," "indicator," "believes," "expects," "potential," "continues," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "predicts," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates" or the negative version of these words or other comparable words.
