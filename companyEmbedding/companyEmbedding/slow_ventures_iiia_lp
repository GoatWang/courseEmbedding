A VC firm made up of early Facebook employees just closed a $145 million fund — and added another Facebooker to the team

  When Kevin Colleran, Dave Morin, and Sam Lessin decided to form
  Slow Ventures, they had one mission: to give the founders in
  their portfolio time to build sound companies with a strong
  foundation.


  More than five years later, the firm has raised its third
  fund, hired two more investing partners, and made more than
  200 investments in some of the hottest startups of the
  moment, including Allbirds, Casper, and Slack. 


  On Thursday, Slow Ventures is announcing that it's closed Slow
  Ventures III, a $145 million fund that brings the firm's total
  capital under management to about $250 million. The firm raised
  the fund from more than 100 CEOs, tech founders, executives, VCs,
  university endowments, and foundations. 


  Slow Ventures differs from other VC firms because of how active
  its LPs are, the firm says. LPs help with sourcing and doing due
  diligence on startups, along with mentoring the founders
  within Slow Ventures' portfolio.

  All three of Slow Venture's founding partners were Facebook
  employees before forming the fund: Colleran was one of Facebook's
  first 10 employees, serving as the company's first ad executive;
  Morin is the co-creator of Facebook's platform and went on
  to found his own startup, Path; and Sam Lessin served
  as Facebook’s former vice president of
  product management until 2014. 


Will Quist joined Slow Ventures in November 2015 after
  spending about eight years at Industry Ventures. 

Now, Slow Ventures is adding a fifth investing partner and
  the firm's fourth former Facebooker with the hiring
  of Scott Marlette. Marlette is an LP and has been an
  advisor to Slow Ventures since its first fund. He is also an
  early Facebook employee: Marlette was one of Facebook's first
  product managers in 2005 up until 2010.


  "As friends and colleagues, we’ve known each other for a long
  time and respect one another’s ideas and instincts," the firm
  wrote in a blog post. "Our willingness to debate and disagree
  has benefited our work and our community tremendously by giving
  everyone the permission to think differently and pursue their
  individual passions and interests. There are very few rules we
  won't consider breaking or sectors we won't explore. When we see
  signs of innovation and opportunity on the edges of science,
  society and culture, we dive in. As entrepreneurs and network
  thinkers ourselves, we believe in supporting incredible people
  and brilliant minds, no matter which unconventional ideas they
  may pursue."
