CrossLead News | CrossLead                    CrossLead   CrossLead News Time is your most valuable currency, spend it wisely Written by Jess Reif“How can I make the most of my time?”This question has kept leaders up at night for centuries.  In 1918, Charles M. Schwab was the President of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.  Schwab knew a thing or two about getting things done.  Under his leadership, the Bethlehem Steel grew to be the largest shipbuilder and second largest steel producer in the United States. He was widely renowned as a leader and manager and had accumulated a substantial fortune. Still, Schwab strived for constant improvement and believed there was an opportunity to improve his own productivity and the effectiveness of his team.  To help him on this quest, he brought in seasoned management consultant Ivy Ledbetter Lee.  Schwab instructed, “Show me a way to get more things done.”[1]   Continue reading Time is your most valuable currency, spend it wisely   CrossLead Platform Version 5 Released Version 5 of the CrossLead Platform was released and for the first time we used email to notify hundreds of users at once! V5 contains new features that will help you collaborate more with your team to obtain beyond optimum results. Continue reading CrossLead Platform Version 5 Released   How CrossLead Helps Teams Avoid Sleeping in Terminals Written by Alex Laverty and Chris Wysocki“You ever feel like you’re living in an airport?”The rite of passage of spending the night in terminal a la Tom Hanks style is a common but unenjoyable cost of doing consulting business. In 2014, one of us had the pleasure of making their overnight stay in Chicago’s O’Hare airport. Fortunately,  500,000 miles have since passed without suffering a second night using a suitcase as a pillow.This has been part luck, part proficiency in the art of travel hacking: finding the best routes with the best equipment at the lowest cost to the client. In the days before Google Flights revolutionized trip planning, this process was time-intensive and spread across multiple websites. Regardless of method, time was always considered the most important variable. If the flight arrived in the destination city with enough time for a full night’s sleep or with enough time to make client meetings, that would qualify as a success. Continue reading How CrossLead Helps Teams Avoid Sleeping in Terminals   Align with Growth in Mind  Written by Jess Reif“Nothing is new except what has been forgotten.” – Marie AntoinetteThough all companies grow differently, most have a common goal: to maintain the focus and level of energy they had when they were just a small team. This becomes very challenging as an enterprise takes on more employees, business lines, and customers. Though many of today’s stories of high growth take place in fast-paced technology companies, a look at the history of Arlington, Virginia can prepare us for one of the biggest obstacles companies with a “hockey stick” trajectory face: a lack of internal alignment. Continue reading Align with Growth in Mind   Too Many Meetings? 4 Ways to Reduce Time Spent in Meetings Written by Matt Sitter“How did it get so late so soon?” – Dr. SeussIn the midst of a hectic day, we’ve all looked up in the afternoon and had the realization that our most precious resource (time) has been unceremoniously taken from us. According to Atlassian, the average employee attends 62 meetings per month and believes about half of that time is wasted. Managers and executives attend even more meetings!Here are four ways you can cut meetings and get your team’s time back. Continue reading Too Many Meetings? 4 Ways to Reduce Time Spent in Meetings   Trust: The Bedrock of Elite Team Performance Written by John PreviteraHigh performing teams depend on several universally accepted tenants like common purpose, open collaboration and adaptability. Whether you are part of a Navy SEAL Team, a World Cup soccer team, or a Software Scrum Team, these tenants are supported by the core bedrock of Trust. Continue reading Trust: The Bedrock of Elite Team Performance   Predict the Future or Prepare for It? Written by John Sipher   |  LinkedIn  |   MediumAt the end of the year it is customary for various publications to reflect on the past year and make predictions for the coming one. In the 2016 year-end edition of “The Economist”, Tor Garnett of the London Metropolitan Police outlined her view of the future in a series of articles highlighting “young prophets.”According to Garnett, “Our command-and-control leadership style might be crucial during a crisis but it is failing to deliver both the radical innovation and continuous improvement that are needed to manage increasingly complex security risks and criminal threats. Moving away from the ‘leader as hero’ style to a ‘team of teams’ approach, as many lean manufacturing businesses have done, will be difficult but vital to our success.”  Continue reading Predict the Future or Prepare for It?   The 15 Minute Meeting That Will Change the Way Your Team Collaborates Written by Jess ReifOn the morning of August 14, 1914, the French military governor of Paris and commander of the Armies of Paris General Joseph-Simon Gallieni, called a meeting of his cabinet.  This gathering was not an ordinary meeting. It was less than four weeks after the beginning of World War I, and German troops were already advancing on Paris. The General requested that his cabinet stand, rather than sit, and asked that they refrain from wasting time discussing issues related to whether or not to defend Paris.  Instead, he asked the group to certify its existing plans to defend the city, and review specific tactical orders in order to speed up the process. The meeting lasted just fifteen minutes.[1] Continue reading The 15 Minute Meeting That Will Change the Way Your Team Collaborates   4 Things Chief Strategy Officers are Talking About Written by Matt Sitter   |   LinkedInOn December 5th and 6th, I had the pleasure of attending the Chief Strategy Officer Summit put on by Innovation Enterprise in New York. This group of professionals had a distinct energy – there’s a lot of uncertainty in the world and their organizations have charged them with determining not only a viable path, but one that will bring them great success. This is no small task! Continue reading 4 Things Chief Strategy Officers are Talking About   Why You Should Focus on Improving Shared Consciousness.  It Isn’t What You Think. Written by Steven ScagnelliWhen considering the four principles of CrossLead: Trust, Empowered Execution, Common Purpose, and Shared Consciousness, it is Shared Consciousness that is often seen as the most abstract. It is straightforward to look back at events and see when you trusted someone, when you were empowered to accomplish a task, or when you were with a group that all shared a common purpose. If someone were to ask you the last time you shared consciousness with someone, you might ask them how long it has been since they left the commune.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

On engineering, everyone works in parallel and rarely collaboratively- Weak standard of excellence - while most engineers are capable, cases of underperformance put product development at risk, and were overlooked for quite some time- The company is primarily a consulting firm, with sales-driven rather than product-driven approach, and lacks a unified product vision- Product and design team consists of junior employees whom management does not trust with job responsibilities and instead micromanages. PMs pick up design responsibilities like wireframing with no design experience, while almost all product decisions fall back to CEOAdvice to ManagementFill gap in product leadership, hire high performers with appropriate prior experience and empower them to do their jobsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) CrossLead Response seconds agoEdit • Delete CrossLead 2017-06-09 13:47 PDT Nov 7, 2016 CrossLead Logo"Inspirational organization with the mission of changing how businesses do strategic planning"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Washington, DCCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Washington, DCRecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at CrossLead full-time (Less than a year)Pros- Great team, great culture- Flexible hours / work location (lots of the team is remote)- DC office is brand new, great space- Lots of opportunity for leadership, even in mid- and junior- level positionsCons- Always some uncertainty when working at a start-up- Product changes a lot (most of the changes are good, just something to get used to)Advice to ManagementFocus on making the product sell itselfShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) CrossLead Response seconds agoEdit • Delete CrossLead 2016-11-07 08:05 PST Oct 13, 2016 Helpful (4) CrossLead Logo"Management Issues and Job Description Issues"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Contractor - User Experience/UI Designer in Washington, DCFormer Contractor - User Experience/UI Designer in Washington, DCDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookI worked at CrossLead as a contractor (Less than a year)ProsCourteous, Allows remote work. Very organized in Jira and mostly does a good job at managing work bandwidth. They give time for teams to group up and digest the work to come and the work that was recently done. Communication was usually very accessible for some people which makes it easier for me to get feedback.ConsAn inexperienced company, very new and is still trying to find their vision, design language, and footing. The company and the product have very large fundamental problems that are just pushed aside and ignored for the sake of a release date. Some people in the company who are higher ups constantly try to do the job of others while having little to no experience on the subject. As a designer, they'd constantly skip steps in the design process and push deadlines for underdeveloped solutions. For developers, they'd constantly be left out of the loop of product development until late stages where conflicts would arise. This company just chews through contractors and freelancers which has made their design chaotic and inconsistent which will be the product's downfall. Probably to avoid paying adequate compensation and benefits.Advice to ManagementPlease heed the advice and concerns of your creative and developer employees. Please make the design and development processes a conversation instead of isolating the teams into their own islands. Don't rush or skip steps in the design process, every step is important and especially the early ones.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) CrossLead Response seconds agoEdit • Delete CrossLead 2016-10-13 21:37 PDT Aug 26, 2016 CrossLead Logo"CrossLead has a good product and is doing everything right. Just a matter of time before they become a huge player."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookProsCrossLead spun off from McChrystal Group in 2016 in order to emphasize their services around their enterprise software platform, which helps execute the "Team of Teams" theory for organizations of any size. CrossLead functions very well as a company, in part because they truly administer their organizational theory into their own company. They are the biggest believers of what they are selling, and that is something not a lot of companies can say. Because of their dedication to immaculate organization, there is a level of transparency, camaraderie and efficiency that I have never seen before at company, especially a startup.ConsWhile the product development and engineering side is finely tuned machine, the client services side seemed less together. It would serve them well to have a bigger emphasis on business development and sales. However I believe they are already aware of this and are implementing solutions.Advice to ManagementThe cloud platform is awesome, but don't lose sight of the importance of the consulting part too. The Team of Teams philosophy is best experienced when both of these are present.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) CrossLead Response seconds agoEdit • Delete CrossLead 2016-08-26 21:56 PDTReviews > CrossLead RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsWork From HomeAdd BenefitsSee AllSee All Related Job SearchPharmacy Technician jobsPharmacy Technician salaries ($23k)Administrative Assistant jobsAdministrative Assistant salaries ($36k)Healthcare jobsHealthcare salaries ($47k)Receptionist jobsReceptionist salaries ($24k)Engineering jobsEngineering salaries ($75k)Registered Nurse jobsRegistered Nurse salaries ($59k)Sales Associate jobsSales Associate salaries ($37k)Mechanical Engineer jobsMechanical Engineer salaries ($70k)Hospitality jobsHospitality salaries ($21k)Account Executive jobsAccount Executive salaries ($47k)Truck Driver jobsTruck Driver salaries ($43k)Medical Assistant jobsMedical Assistant salaries ($29k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.
