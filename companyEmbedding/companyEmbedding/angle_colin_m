History[edit]
iRobot was founded in 1990 by Rodney Brooks, Colin Angle and Helen Greiner after working in MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab.

In 1998 the company received a DARPA research contract which led to the development of the PackBot.
In September 2002, iRobot unveiled its home robots flagship, the Roomba, which sold a million units by 2004.[5]
iRobot began being traded on the NASDAQ in November 2005, under ticker symbol IRBT.
On September 17, 2012, iRobot announced that it had acquired Evolution Robotics, manufacturer of automated floor mopper Mint.[6]

iRobot has sold more than 8 million home robots, and has deployed more than 5,000 defense & security robots, as of 2012.[7]
In addition to deployment as bomb-disposal units with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, PackBots have been used to gather data in dangerous conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site,[8] and an IRobot Seaglider detected underwater pools of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[9]
iRobot has been criticized for attempting unregulated use of 6240-6740 MHz band, and asking for an FCC exemption to do so. This band is for use for the lawn mowing robot without needing to use an electronic fence as a boundary marker, instead by using radio beacons. The band falls into a band reserved for radio astronomy use, thus interfering with radio telescope observations of methanol's 6.66852 GHz emissions.[10]
In February 2016, iRobot announced that it would sell its military robotics business to Arlington Capital Partners, in order to focus more on the consumer market.[11]
Military and policing robots[edit]

In April 2016, iRobot sold off its Defense & Security unit, with a new company being formed called Endeavor Robotics.[12]
First Generation Robots[edit]

Genghis (1991) was iRobot's first robot. It was designed as a test platform for researchers. The robot is currently at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum
Ariel (1996) is a crab-like robot designed to remove mines, both in and out of water.
Urbie (1997) was a proof of concept robot designed for urban environments. The platform was designed with two tank-like tracks so it could climb stairs. Urbie was field tested at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States; one model was gifted to a local high school on indefinite loan in 2005. High school students at Columbus High School in Columbus, GA, reconditioned the robot and created a usage manual for future students to continue to benefit from Urbie's list of talents. Urbie is built around a light, machined aluminum chassis. The exterior consists of flat aluminum plates, bent at the front and back, which are attached to the chassis with small hex screws. 2 dc motors power the forward rotating arms, while 2 slightly larger dc motors power the body length treads. From the outside, Urbie is an exact replica of the PackBot Scout. The front compartment holds 2 banks of LEDs, one white light, the other infrared. The center-front compartment holds a video camera and an infrared camera. Both cameras' images are transmitted back to a handheld LCD screen and remote control console via a single antenna. The image that is transmitted back is controlled by a mechanical switch, thrown remotely inside the chassis by a remote controlled actuator. The motors are controlled the same way that a remote control airplane or car is. The ability to reverse the tread direction on both sides gives the robot a 0 degree turn radius. In 2006, the exterior body was refinished, the antennas were repaired (replaced by a fishing pole) and some of the interior electronics were updated. The robot is simply constructed, with basic electronic controls, and is the same physical design as the current PackBots, it only lacks the digital processor.
SWARM is an artificial intelligence research project designed to develop algorithms for swarms of hundreds of individual robots. This project is sponsored by DARPA.

PackBot[edit]
Main article: PackBot

PackBot is a series of military robots designed for situational awareness, reconnaissance, explosive ordnance disposal and other missions. More than 2000 PackBots are currently on station in Iraq and Afghanistan, with hundreds more on the way.[13]

SUGV[edit]
Main article: Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle

iRobot's platform for the United States Army's Future Combat Systems.

Warrior[edit]
Main article: iRobot Warrior

Warrior, currently in development (expected deployment in 2008[14]), is a 250 lb (110 kg) machine that can travel up to 12 miles per hour (19 km/h) through rough terrain and up and down stairs while carrying payloads weighing over 100 pounds (45 kg). Its potential uses include bomb disposal, battlefield casualty extraction and firefighting.[15]

R-Gator[edit]
Main article: iRobot R-Gator

R-Gator, a product of a partnership with John Deere Corporation, is a small utility vehicle with a robotics package added. It is capable of autonomous operation including waypoint following with obstacle avoidance, following dismounted infantry and other vehicles and semi-autonomous operation such as teleoperation with obstacle avoidance. Vehicles are currently in production.[16][17]

Negotiator[edit]
Main article: iRobot Negotiator

Negotiator is a man-portable civil-response surveillance and reconnaissance robot.[18]

Transphibian[edit]
Main article: iRobot Transphibian

Transphibian is a man-portable UUV and bottom crawler that autonomously inserts itself into the water and operates in a shallow area. It is designed for mine detection, harbor defense and surveillance.[19]

Chembot[edit]

Chembot is a DARPA-funded prototype of a shape-shifting robot without motors, wheels or any rigid elements. It runs on chemical power and is made using dielectric elastomers, which are extremely flexible and can alter their shape in electric or magnetic fields. Ultimately, the program aims to build a robot that is completely squishy and able to squeeze through a hole 'the size of a 10 pence coin'.[20]

Ember[edit]

Ember is a prototype miniature, tracked robot, weighing around 1 lb and costing so little to make that it is intended to be virtually disposable. Ember moves at walking pace, can right itself when it is turned over and is controlled by a simple touchscreen application on an Apple iPhone. Ember is a military robot designed to boost radio communications and capture video footage to aid infantry warfighters.[20]

AIRarm[edit]
AIRarm is an inflatable arm robot developed by iRobot. The inflatable arm uses pumps to inflate the arm. Since the arm uses strings and actuators, no motors were used at the joints.[21]
FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is a small reconnaissance robot weighing 5.2 lb (2.4 kg) with a top speed of 3.8 mph (6.1 km/h) and line-of-sight control range of 200 m (219 yd). It has visible and thermal cameras and infrared sensors to gather and transmit images of buildings, caves, or other locations. It can participate in explosive ordnance disposal by carrying 2.5 lb (1.1 kg) of C4 explosive to an IED. The robot has the ability to mesh together a network of feeds from other robots to extend the range of its sensors. The FirstLook has CBRN detectors and is semi-autonomous, meaning it can perform tasks like course correction and flipping itself over without direct intervention. 100 were bought by JIEDDO in March 2012 and the Pentagon has ordered hundreds more.[22]
Medical Robots[edit]
RP-VITA[edit]

RP-VITA, or Remote Presence Virtual + Independent Telemedicine Assistant, is a medical robot jointly produced with InTouch Health. The robot will be cloud-connected and have access to a patient's medical record, and will also be able to plug in diagnostic devices such as stethoscopes, otoscopes, and ultrasound.[23]

Research and dual-role robots[edit]
Ranger[edit]
Main article: iRobot Ranger

Ranger is a man-portable UUV that supports technology development related to mine warfare, expeditionary warfare, homeland defense, underwater surveillance / reconnaissance and other missions. Ranger is also suitable for ocean research and commercial applications related to search and survey.[24]

Seaglider[edit]
Main article: iRobot Seaglider

Seaglider is a long-range dual-role autonomous underwater vehicle entering production under an exclusive manufacturing agreement from the University of Washington. Capable of operating for months over thousands of kilometers on a single battery charge, networked Seagliders provide scientists and naval intelligence with cost-effective real-time access to oceanographic measurements.[25][26] The Seaglider is also used in military applications where it is more usually designated as an unmanned underwater vehicle.

Home robots[edit]
Roomba[edit]
Main article: Roomba
Roomba is an automated vacuum cleaning robot first released in 2002. Roomba is powered by a rechargeable battery, and many models are available with a docking station to which the Roomba should return to recharge at the end of its cleaning cycle. They work in conjunction with accessories that use both IR and RF.
The company intentionally allows customers to hack the robot because they want people to experiment and improve the product. The API for the serial has been published and the serial port made easily accessible to make modifications easy to perform.[27]
Scooba[edit]
Main article: Scooba_(brand)
Scooba was iRobot's floor-washing robot. The product became commercially available in limited quantities in late 2005 before a full product release in 2006. Early models required either a special non-bleach cleaning solution or white vinegar to wash hard floors. Newer units could use plain water. Several versions were marketed. iRobot phased out the Scooba line of products in favor of the Braava line of floor moppers in 2016.[28]
Braava[edit]
Braava is iRobot's Floor Mopping Robot, designed to work on all hard-surface floors. Braava uses disposable or microfiber cleaning cloths for damp and/or dry cleaning. The design was known as the Mint until 2013. It was developed by Evolution Robotics, which was acquired by iRobot in 2012.[29]
Create[edit]
Main article: iRobot Create
Create is a hobby robot, released in 2007. Create offers users the possibility of changing or adapting the robot's functions through experimentation with the basic elements of robotics as well as by adding sensors, grippers, wireless connections, computers, or other hardware.
Verro[edit]
Verro is a swimming-pool cleaning robot released in April 2007.[30]
Looj[edit]
Looj is a gutter-cleaning robot released in September 2007, and based on an autonomous version created for a science fair project created by Lucas Garrow in 2004 (Garrow was a finalist in the 2004 The Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge (DCYSC)). Looj is not an autonomous robot, but rather a remote-controlled robot patterned after a toy tank with an auger mounted on the front. The robot fits inside most gutters to clean out debris stuck inside them, such as leaves and pine needles. It has long treads on its side which allow it to move inside the gutter. The auger dislodges and removes almost all of the debris inside the gutter by flinging it sideways into the air. Looj also has a detachable handle/remote that is used to carry and operate the robot.
Discontinued products[edit]
Dirt Dog (char)[edit]
Dirt Dog was designed for workshop use and was released in 2006. This product picks up small objects such as nuts, bolts, dirt, and debris from a workshop or similar floor. The unit was able to be used on hard floors, shop carpets and industrial floor surfaces. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in late 2010.
My Real Baby Jade[edit]
My Real Baby was a robotic toy marketed by iRobot from 2000 and produced in partnership with the toy manufacturer Hasbro. It is no longer in production. This product, which was meant to look like a human infant, employed animatronic facial expressions and was developed from an emotionally expressive and responsive robot developed by iRobot corporation called "IT."
ConnectR[edit]
Connect R was made in 2010 and then discontinued.
In Development[edit]
Robotic Lawn Mower[edit]

In recent developments, iRobot recently received FCC approval to move forward with their plans to commercialize and build a robotic lawn mower capable of using wireless technology, similar to their Roomba robot [31]

Genghis (1991) was iRobot's first robot. It was designed as a test platform for researchers. The robot is currently at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum
Ariel (1996) is a crab-like robot designed to remove mines, both in and out of water.
Urbie (1997) was a proof of concept robot designed for urban environments. The platform was designed with two tank-like tracks so it could climb stairs. Urbie was field tested at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States; one model was gifted to a local high school on indefinite loan in 2005. High school students at Columbus High School in Columbus, GA, reconditioned the robot and created a usage manual for future students to continue to benefit from Urbie's list of talents. Urbie is built around a light, machined aluminum chassis. The exterior consists of flat aluminum plates, bent at the front and back, which are attached to the chassis with small hex screws. 2 dc motors power the forward rotating arms, while 2 slightly larger dc motors power the body length treads. From the outside, Urbie is an exact replica of the PackBot Scout. The front compartment holds 2 banks of LEDs, one white light, the other infrared. The center-front compartment holds a video camera and an infrared camera. Both cameras' images are transmitted back to a handheld LCD screen and remote control console via a single antenna. The image that is transmitted back is controlled by a mechanical switch, thrown remotely inside the chassis by a remote controlled actuator. The motors are controlled the same way that a remote control airplane or car is. The ability to reverse the tread direction on both sides gives the robot a 0 degree turn radius. In 2006, the exterior body was refinished, the antennas were repaired (replaced by a fishing pole) and some of the interior electronics were updated. The robot is simply constructed, with basic electronic controls, and is the same physical design as the current PackBots, it only lacks the digital processor.
SWARM is an artificial intelligence research project designed to develop algorithms for swarms of hundreds of individual robots. This project is sponsored by DARPA.

History[edit]
iRobot was founded in 1990 by Rodney Brooks, Colin Angle and Helen Greiner after working in MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab.

In 1998 the company received a DARPA research contract which led to the development of the PackBot.
In September 2002, iRobot unveiled its home robots flagship, the Roomba, which sold a million units by 2004.[5]
iRobot began being traded on the NASDAQ in November 2005, under ticker symbol IRBT.
On September 17, 2012, iRobot announced that it had acquired Evolution Robotics, manufacturer of automated floor mopper Mint.[6]

iRobot has sold more than 8 million home robots, and has deployed more than 5,000 defense & security robots, as of 2012.[7]
In addition to deployment as bomb-disposal units with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, PackBots have been used to gather data in dangerous conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site,[8] and an IRobot Seaglider detected underwater pools of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[9]
iRobot has been criticized for attempting unregulated use of 6240-6740 MHz band, and asking for an FCC exemption to do so. This band is for use for the lawn mowing robot without needing to use an electronic fence as a boundary marker, instead by using radio beacons. The band falls into a band reserved for radio astronomy use, thus interfering with radio telescope observations of methanol's 6.66852 GHz emissions.[10]
In February 2016, iRobot announced that it would sell its military robotics business to Arlington Capital Partners, in order to focus more on the consumer market.[11]
Military and policing robots[edit]

History[edit]
iRobot was founded in 1990 by Rodney Brooks, Colin Angle and Helen Greiner after working in MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab.

In 1998 the company received a DARPA research contract which led to the development of the PackBot.
In September 2002, iRobot unveiled its home robots flagship, the Roomba, which sold a million units by 2004.[5]
iRobot began being traded on the NASDAQ in November 2005, under ticker symbol IRBT.
On September 17, 2012, iRobot announced that it had acquired Evolution Robotics, manufacturer of automated floor mopper Mint.[6]

iRobot has sold more than 8 million home robots, and has deployed more than 5,000 defense & security robots, as of 2012.[7]
In addition to deployment as bomb-disposal units with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, PackBots have been used to gather data in dangerous conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site,[8] and an IRobot Seaglider detected underwater pools of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[9]
iRobot has been criticized for attempting unregulated use of 6240-6740 MHz band, and asking for an FCC exemption to do so. This band is for use for the lawn mowing robot without needing to use an electronic fence as a boundary marker, instead by using radio beacons. The band falls into a band reserved for radio astronomy use, thus interfering with radio telescope observations of methanol's 6.66852 GHz emissions.[10]
In February 2016, iRobot announced that it would sell its military robotics business to Arlington Capital Partners, in order to focus more on the consumer market.[11]
Military and policing robots[edit]

In April 2016, iRobot sold off its Defense & Security unit, with a new company being formed called Endeavor Robotics.[12]
First Generation Robots[edit]

Genghis (1991) was iRobot's first robot. It was designed as a test platform for researchers. The robot is currently at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum
Ariel (1996) is a crab-like robot designed to remove mines, both in and out of water.
Urbie (1997) was a proof of concept robot designed for urban environments. The platform was designed with two tank-like tracks so it could climb stairs. Urbie was field tested at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States; one model was gifted to a local high school on indefinite loan in 2005. High school students at Columbus High School in Columbus, GA, reconditioned the robot and created a usage manual for future students to continue to benefit from Urbie's list of talents. Urbie is built around a light, machined aluminum chassis. The exterior consists of flat aluminum plates, bent at the front and back, which are attached to the chassis with small hex screws. 2 dc motors power the forward rotating arms, while 2 slightly larger dc motors power the body length treads. From the outside, Urbie is an exact replica of the PackBot Scout. The front compartment holds 2 banks of LEDs, one white light, the other infrared. The center-front compartment holds a video camera and an infrared camera. Both cameras' images are transmitted back to a handheld LCD screen and remote control console via a single antenna. The image that is transmitted back is controlled by a mechanical switch, thrown remotely inside the chassis by a remote controlled actuator. The motors are controlled the same way that a remote control airplane or car is. The ability to reverse the tread direction on both sides gives the robot a 0 degree turn radius. In 2006, the exterior body was refinished, the antennas were repaired (replaced by a fishing pole) and some of the interior electronics were updated. The robot is simply constructed, with basic electronic controls, and is the same physical design as the current PackBots, it only lacks the digital processor.
SWARM is an artificial intelligence research project designed to develop algorithms for swarms of hundreds of individual robots. This project is sponsored by DARPA.

PackBot[edit]
Main article: PackBot

PackBot is a series of military robots designed for situational awareness, reconnaissance, explosive ordnance disposal and other missions. More than 2000 PackBots are currently on station in Iraq and Afghanistan, with hundreds more on the way.[13]

SUGV[edit]
Main article: Small Unmanned Ground Vehicle

iRobot's platform for the United States Army's Future Combat Systems.

Warrior[edit]
Main article: iRobot Warrior

Warrior, currently in development (expected deployment in 2008[14]), is a 250 lb (110 kg) machine that can travel up to 12 miles per hour (19 km/h) through rough terrain and up and down stairs while carrying payloads weighing over 100 pounds (45 kg). Its potential uses include bomb disposal, battlefield casualty extraction and firefighting.[15]

R-Gator[edit]
Main article: iRobot R-Gator

R-Gator, a product of a partnership with John Deere Corporation, is a small utility vehicle with a robotics package added. It is capable of autonomous operation including waypoint following with obstacle avoidance, following dismounted infantry and other vehicles and semi-autonomous operation such as teleoperation with obstacle avoidance. Vehicles are currently in production.[16][17]

Negotiator[edit]
Main article: iRobot Negotiator

Negotiator is a man-portable civil-response surveillance and reconnaissance robot.[18]

Transphibian[edit]
Main article: iRobot Transphibian

Transphibian is a man-portable UUV and bottom crawler that autonomously inserts itself into the water and operates in a shallow area. It is designed for mine detection, harbor defense and surveillance.[19]

Chembot[edit]

Chembot is a DARPA-funded prototype of a shape-shifting robot without motors, wheels or any rigid elements. It runs on chemical power and is made using dielectric elastomers, which are extremely flexible and can alter their shape in electric or magnetic fields. Ultimately, the program aims to build a robot that is completely squishy and able to squeeze through a hole 'the size of a 10 pence coin'.[20]

Ember[edit]

Ember is a prototype miniature, tracked robot, weighing around 1 lb and costing so little to make that it is intended to be virtually disposable. Ember moves at walking pace, can right itself when it is turned over and is controlled by a simple touchscreen application on an Apple iPhone. Ember is a military robot designed to boost radio communications and capture video footage to aid infantry warfighters.[20]

AIRarm[edit]
AIRarm is an inflatable arm robot developed by iRobot. The inflatable arm uses pumps to inflate the arm. Since the arm uses strings and actuators, no motors were used at the joints.[21]
FirstLook[edit]
FirstLook is a small reconnaissance robot weighing 5.2 lb (2.4 kg) with a top speed of 3.8 mph (6.1 km/h) and line-of-sight control range of 200 m (219 yd). It has visible and thermal cameras and infrared sensors to gather and transmit images of buildings, caves, or other locations. It can participate in explosive ordnance disposal by carrying 2.5 lb (1.1 kg) of C4 explosive to an IED. The robot has the ability to mesh together a network of feeds from other robots to extend the range of its sensors. The FirstLook has CBRN detectors and is semi-autonomous, meaning it can perform tasks like course correction and flipping itself over without direct intervention. 100 were bought by JIEDDO in March 2012 and the Pentagon has ordered hundreds more.[22]
Medical Robots[edit]
RP-VITA[edit]

RP-VITA, or Remote Presence Virtual + Independent Telemedicine Assistant, is a medical robot jointly produced with InTouch Health. The robot will be cloud-connected and have access to a patient's medical record, and will also be able to plug in diagnostic devices such as stethoscopes, otoscopes, and ultrasound.[23]

Research and dual-role robots[edit]
Ranger[edit]
Main article: iRobot Ranger

Ranger is a man-portable UUV that supports technology development related to mine warfare, expeditionary warfare, homeland defense, underwater surveillance / reconnaissance and other missions. Ranger is also suitable for ocean research and commercial applications related to search and survey.[24]

Seaglider[edit]
Main article: iRobot Seaglider

Seaglider is a long-range dual-role autonomous underwater vehicle entering production under an exclusive manufacturing agreement from the University of Washington. Capable of operating for months over thousands of kilometers on a single battery charge, networked Seagliders provide scientists and naval intelligence with cost-effective real-time access to oceanographic measurements.[25][26] The Seaglider is also used in military applications where it is more usually designated as an unmanned underwater vehicle.

Home robots[edit]
Roomba[edit]
Main article: Roomba
Roomba is an automated vacuum cleaning robot first released in 2002. Roomba is powered by a rechargeable battery, and many models are available with a docking station to which the Roomba should return to recharge at the end of its cleaning cycle. They work in conjunction with accessories that use both IR and RF.
The company intentionally allows customers to hack the robot because they want people to experiment and improve the product. The API for the serial has been published and the serial port made easily accessible to make modifications easy to perform.[27]
Scooba[edit]
Main article: Scooba_(brand)
Scooba was iRobot's floor-washing robot. The product became commercially available in limited quantities in late 2005 before a full product release in 2006. Early models required either a special non-bleach cleaning solution or white vinegar to wash hard floors. Newer units could use plain water. Several versions were marketed. iRobot phased out the Scooba line of products in favor of the Braava line of floor moppers in 2016.[28]
Braava[edit]
Braava is iRobot's Floor Mopping Robot, designed to work on all hard-surface floors. Braava uses disposable or microfiber cleaning cloths for damp and/or dry cleaning. The design was known as the Mint until 2013. It was developed by Evolution Robotics, which was acquired by iRobot in 2012.[29]
Create[edit]
Main article: iRobot Create
Create is a hobby robot, released in 2007. Create offers users the possibility of changing or adapting the robot's functions through experimentation with the basic elements of robotics as well as by adding sensors, grippers, wireless connections, computers, or other hardware.
Verro[edit]
Verro is a swimming-pool cleaning robot released in April 2007.[30]
Looj[edit]
Looj is a gutter-cleaning robot released in September 2007, and based on an autonomous version created for a science fair project created by Lucas Garrow in 2004 (Garrow was a finalist in the 2004 The Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge (DCYSC)). Looj is not an autonomous robot, but rather a remote-controlled robot patterned after a toy tank with an auger mounted on the front. The robot fits inside most gutters to clean out debris stuck inside them, such as leaves and pine needles. It has long treads on its side which allow it to move inside the gutter. The auger dislodges and removes almost all of the debris inside the gutter by flinging it sideways into the air. Looj also has a detachable handle/remote that is used to carry and operate the robot.
Discontinued products[edit]
Dirt Dog (char)[edit]
Dirt Dog was designed for workshop use and was released in 2006. This product picks up small objects such as nuts, bolts, dirt, and debris from a workshop or similar floor. The unit was able to be used on hard floors, shop carpets and industrial floor surfaces. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in late 2010.
My Real Baby Jade[edit]
My Real Baby was a robotic toy marketed by iRobot from 2000 and produced in partnership with the toy manufacturer Hasbro. It is no longer in production. This product, which was meant to look like a human infant, employed animatronic facial expressions and was developed from an emotionally expressive and responsive robot developed by iRobot corporation called "IT."
ConnectR[edit]
Connect R was made in 2010 and then discontinued.
In Development[edit]
Robotic Lawn Mower[edit]

In recent developments, iRobot recently received FCC approval to move forward with their plans to commercialize and build a robotic lawn mower capable of using wireless technology, similar to their Roomba robot [31]

Genghis (1991) was iRobot's first robot. It was designed as a test platform for researchers. The robot is currently at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum
Ariel (1996) is a crab-like robot designed to remove mines, both in and out of water.
Urbie (1997) was a proof of concept robot designed for urban environments. The platform was designed with two tank-like tracks so it could climb stairs. Urbie was field tested at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States; one model was gifted to a local high school on indefinite loan in 2005. High school students at Columbus High School in Columbus, GA, reconditioned the robot and created a usage manual for future students to continue to benefit from Urbie's list of talents. Urbie is built around a light, machined aluminum chassis. The exterior consists of flat aluminum plates, bent at the front and back, which are attached to the chassis with small hex screws. 2 dc motors power the forward rotating arms, while 2 slightly larger dc motors power the body length treads. From the outside, Urbie is an exact replica of the PackBot Scout. The front compartment holds 2 banks of LEDs, one white light, the other infrared. The center-front compartment holds a video camera and an infrared camera. Both cameras' images are transmitted back to a handheld LCD screen and remote control console via a single antenna. The image that is transmitted back is controlled by a mechanical switch, thrown remotely inside the chassis by a remote controlled actuator. The motors are controlled the same way that a remote control airplane or car is. The ability to reverse the tread direction on both sides gives the robot a 0 degree turn radius. In 2006, the exterior body was refinished, the antennas were repaired (replaced by a fishing pole) and some of the interior electronics were updated. The robot is simply constructed, with basic electronic controls, and is the same physical design as the current PackBots, it only lacks the digital processor.
SWARM is an artificial intelligence research project designed to develop algorithms for swarms of hundreds of individual robots. This project is sponsored by DARPA.

History[edit]
iRobot was founded in 1990 by Rodney Brooks, Colin Angle and Helen Greiner after working in MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab.

In 1998 the company received a DARPA research contract which led to the development of the PackBot.
In September 2002, iRobot unveiled its home robots flagship, the Roomba, which sold a million units by 2004.[5]
iRobot began being traded on the NASDAQ in November 2005, under ticker symbol IRBT.
On September 17, 2012, iRobot announced that it had acquired Evolution Robotics, manufacturer of automated floor mopper Mint.[6]

iRobot has sold more than 8 million home robots, and has deployed more than 5,000 defense & security robots, as of 2012.[7]
In addition to deployment as bomb-disposal units with the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, PackBots have been used to gather data in dangerous conditions at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site,[8] and an IRobot Seaglider detected underwater pools of oil after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.[9]
iRobot has been criticized for attempting unregulated use of 6240-6740 MHz band, and asking for an FCC exemption to do so. This band is for use for the lawn mowing robot without needing to use an electronic fence as a boundary marker, instead by using radio beacons. The band falls into a band reserved for radio astronomy use, thus interfering with radio telescope observations of methanol's 6.66852 GHz emissions.[10]
In February 2016, iRobot announced that it would sell its military robotics business to Arlington Capital Partners, in order to focus more on the consumer market.[11]
Military and policing robots[edit]

MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory


                  MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory: A system designed to recognize specific scenes, which is a key ingredient in making computers smarter, turned out to also be able to identify objects as an unintended side effect. When humans look at a picture, they automatically make a general judgement call about what’s going on in the scene – they intuit setting and context, essentially. This is a crucial skill that current computer vision and machine learning systems have a lot of trouble with, which can hinder the ability of intelligent systems designed to take on tasks like, say, driving or delivering packages. MIT researchers embarked on tackling scene identification, improving the performance of previous attempts by as much as 33 percent.

Big Inventions from Small Ideas: Interview with iRobot’s Colin Angle

  By Grace Young in Interviews, Web, Mobile & Hardware | 0 comments
 

 Jan 24, 2011
Renowned roboticist and inventor, Colin Angle, is co-founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board of iRobot, maker of the iconic Roomba vacuum cleaner, bomb-defusing PackBot, and many other products that have revolutionized life from living rooms to battlefields. He started iRobot midway through his doctoral program after earning a BS in electrical engineering and MS in computer science from MIT, and managed to incubate and grow the company without initial VC backing. Today, iRobot is a $300 million publicly-traded company that thrives on bringing innovative ideas to market and solving real world problems.  
 
MITER: You’ve said your dream was to build a company that can really change the world. How is iRobot fulfilling your dream? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: In more ways than I could have hoped. Our early work on small robots to explore other planets helped shift NASA’s focus to radically smaller rovers than they had been working on and led to Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity. Our Roomba robot floor vacuum has changed people’s perceptions of what a robot is and can be. With over five million sold, the Roomba is making people’s lives all over the world a bit easier! 
 
MITER: Statistically, it’s very difficult to replicate the “lab-to-market” success of iRobot. How did you and your co-founders do it? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: By focusing on developing technology that enables a whole new class of products (i.e., robots) and answering the driving needs of customers. Robots are not a singular point solution for one problem, but a class of general purpose technology that can be used in many places. By staying true to both of the above ideas, we can continue to innovate and deliver successful products. 
 
MITER: You said you consider yourself "sufficiently crazy to try new things." Is this an important characteristic of entrepreneurship? If so, can you give a personal example? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: If you are not willing to take carefully considered risks, change your role in the company as the company grows, and do what is needed, even if it is unpleasant, you are going to have a hard time with entrepreneurship unless you are very lucky! We kept looking for new, long term applications for robots, even after failing to find ones ten years after we started. That might seem extreme, but that’s what it took for us to succeed. 
 
MITER: As iRobot has grown into a large public company, is it difficult to balance the interests of your shareholders with scientific and/or altruistic impulses? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: There are certainly more ideas than we can afford to pursue, but part of the plan for helping to usher in the robot age is showing that it is not only cool, but also good business. By making some money, we can generate resources to acquire key technologies or products to add to our portfolio. By showing the world that robots are good business, we encourage others to join the space and help build out the industry. So, there are certainly limitations to being a public company, but these limitations are compatible with our mission. 
 
MITER: How has your role in the company changed since the beginning? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: I often joke that my role changes every six months. In the beginning, I did a lot of soldering. Now I do a lot of communicating to investors and employees. In the beginning, I was physically building robots, now I’m focused on building a company that builds robots. Luckily, I have grown with the company and still love what I do! 
 
MITER: What major setbacks, if any, did you encounter while building iRobot and how did you overcome them? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: Not sure your article could be long enough to capture all of them! We were not VC backed in the beginning, so cash flow was always a problem. In fact, we went six years never having enough cash in the bank at the start of a given month to make payroll at the end of the month. That taught us to be incredibly careful with how we spent money and have multiple plans for how we would bring in cash. As a result, we never missed payroll, and our employees felt confident the company was stable. We also entered and exited over 18 different product lines before finding economic success with Roomba and PackBot! 
 
MITER: Is there any skill or discipline you wish you had learned before starting iRobot? 
 
COLIN ANGLE: I think iRobot would have benefitted and moved more quickly to success if I had a greater appreciation for understanding customer needs, both what they need and what they don’t. Not something that comes naturally to engineers! 
 
MITER: How does interaction with customers help you define iRobot as a company? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: Our goal is to make robots that solve real problems, so our robots can deliver real value to our customers. If Roomba had great intelligence and navigational ability, but didn’t clean all the way up to the edges of your room, then it would be a very limited and thus unsuccessful product. In the end, robots either do the job or they don’t, and it’s the customers who get to vote. We exist to serve them. Not the other way around. 
 
MITER: How does iRobot today compare to your original vision for the company? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: It still seems like we are just getting started. The opportunity and potential for robots is SO big. I’ve been at it for 20 years and I can’t imagine doing anything else. 
 
MITER: You’ve said, “Small efforts can change the world.” How has this worked in your life? 
  
COLIN ANGLE: I’m constantly surprised by the impact we have. We are just one company. Most recently, we have launched programs to help inspire kids to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math careers by exposing them to robotics. Now, we have a National Robotics Week and tens of thousands of kids last year got excited about science who may not have before, all germinating from the notion, “Hey, this is a good idea, let’s try it!”  
 
MITER: What advice would you give to entrepreneurs who aspire to be positive change agents? 
 
COLIN ANGLE: Know why you are doing it, because it can be a long road. It can also be one of the most rewarding things you ever do.
