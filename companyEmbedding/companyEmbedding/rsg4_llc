RELATED APPLICATIONS
 [0001]  This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/885,837 filed Jan. 19, 2007, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 [0002]  The present invention relates generally to a method and agents for profiling or stratifying an individual or group of individuals with respect to a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state, including a sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. More particularly, the present invention utilizes genetic means to profile or stratify individuals with respect to a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. The present invention enables the identification of individuals at risk of these disorders thus affording the opportunity for early intervention. In addition, the subject invention allows the prediction of drug or other treatment response and adverse reactions.
 DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART
 [0003]  Reference to any prior art in this specification is not, and should not be taken as, an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms a part of the common general knowledge in any country.
  [0004]  Psychological “disorders” are endemic in many societies. Reference to “disorders” in this context means that an individual exhibits behavioral patterns which are inconsistent with societal norms. Most psychological phenotypes have both environmental and genetic risk factors. The basis of these disorders is in many cases significantly genetic. For example, early detection of disorders such as schizophrenia using genetic technology has considerable potential to identify those at risk prior to the development of this chronic condition. Commencement of a low dose antipsychotic regime and early cognitive behavioral therapy may prevent the emergence of the full disorder. Development of the full disorder is associated with significant impairment of social, cognitive and occupational functioning. In Australia, the morbidity and mortality data for those with schizophrenia are similar to the poor health outcomes faced by other disenfranchised groups such as Indigenous Australians.
  [0005]  Schizophrenia is a particularly complex psychological phenotype. Schizophrenia is a common, chronic, disabling illness with an incidence of 15 new cases per 100,000 population per year (Kelly et al, Ir. J. Med. Sci. 172:37-40, 2003). Additionally, “unaffected” first degree relatives show both child (Niendam et al, Am. J. Psychiatry. 160:2060-2062, 2003) and adult (MacDonald et al, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 60:57-65, 2003) deficits in cognitive functioning. Siblings of those with schizophrenia also exhibit an abnormal MRI response in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex implicating inefficient information processing (Callicott et al, Am. J. Psychiatry. 160:709-719, 2003). Furthermore, both those with schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings show both reductions in hippocampal volume and hippocampal shape deformity (Tepest et al, Biol, Psychiatry. 54:1234-1240, 2003). Decreased temporoparietal P300 amplitude and increased frontal P300 amplitude are found in both schizophrenic patients and their siblings (Winterer et al, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 60:1158-1167, 2003). Taken together, these findings indicate that the underlying pathophysiological state of schizophrenia is considerably more widespread in the general population than prevalence figures for schizophrenia would suggest and that a considerable genetic vulnerability for this disorder exists.
  [0006]  The apparent high genetic risk for schizophrenia has led to considerable research efforts aimed at the identification of susceptibility genes. This has resulted in linkages or associations with regions 6p21-22, 1q21-22 and 13q32-34 with single studies reporting significance at P<0.05 (Owen et al, Mol. Psychiatry. 9:14-27, 2004) although a large multi-centre linkage study of schizophrenia loci on chromosome 22q failed to find any evidence for linkage or association to schizophrenia (Mowry et al, Mol. Psychiatry. 2004). Other regions that may be implicated include 8p21-22, 6q21-25, 5q21-q33, 10p15-p11 and 1q42 (Owen et al, supra 2004). Despite this limited progress, the conclusive identification of specific molecular genetic etiological factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia has not occurred (Miyamoto et al, Mol. Intervent. 3:27-39, 2004). However, it is clear from epidemiological studies (Gottesman I I et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 58:199, 1967; McGue M et al, Arch Gen Psych. 46:478-480) that the mode of transmission is complex and the predisposition of disease is most likely due to multiple genes exerting modest to small effect (Risch, Gen Epidemiol, 7:3-16, 1990).
  [0007]  Several lines of evidence have implicated the dopamine 2 receptor (DRD2) gene and genes related to neurotransmitters that influence dopamine function as candidates gene for schizophrenia genetic susceptibility. For example, all anti-psychotic medications are either antagonists or partial agonists of DRD2. DRD2 receptor has been repeatedly demonstrated to be the primary site of action for these medications (Seeman and Kapur, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:7673-7675, 2000) indicating that schizophrenic symptoms are ameliorated by a reduction in DRD2 function. Additionally, recent evidence strongly suggests that schizophrenic patients have increased brain DRD2 density (Abi-Dargham et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 97:8104-8109, 2000). Recently, several genotyping studies have identified an association of the 957C>T polymorphism (rs6277) of the DRD2 gene and schizophrenia in Northern European, Spanish and Finnish populations (Lawford et al, Schizo Res, 73:31-37, 2005; Hoenicka et al, Acta Psychiatr Scand, 114:435-438, 2006; Hanninen et al, Neuros Lett, 407:195-198, 2006). In addition, a gene located in close proximity to the DRD2 locus, the ankyrin repeat and protein kinase domain-containing protein 1 (ANKK1) gene, has been associated with schizophrenia (Dubretret et al, Schizophrenia Res, 49:202-212, 2001; Dubretret et al, Schizophrenia Res, 67:75-85, 2004).
  [0008]  Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 or dysbindin (DTNBP1) is the most convincing susceptibility gene for schizophrenia to date (Norton et al, Curr Opin Psychiatr, 19:158-164, 2006). DTNBP1 maps to chromosome 6p22.3 which is a consistently replicated schizophrenia linkage region (Group, Am J Med Genet, 67:580-594, 1996; Lewis et al, Am J Hum Genet, 73:34-48, 2003). Screening of exons has failed to identify mutations that associate non-synonymous alleles with disease, suggesting that susceptibility variants may affect mRNA expression or processing (Williams et al, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 61:336-344, 2004). Recent studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have lower mRNA concentrations in the prefrontal cortex and midbrain when compared to controls (Talbot et al, J Clin Invest, 113:1353-1363, 2004; Weickert et al, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 61:544-555, 2004). The mechanisms of vulnerability to schizophrenia remain uncertain, however, and recent study has shown DTNBP1 to be located presynaptically in glutamatergic neurons (Talbot et al, supra 2004). This observation may confer the vulnerability of schizophrenia through aberrant regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission.
  [0009]  Regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (RSG4) is located within a putative linkage region at chromosome 1q21-22. A global study of expression has identified a decrease in RSG4 expression in prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia (Mimics et al, Mol Psychiatry, 6:293-301, 2001; Chowdari et al, Hum Mol Genet, 11(12):1373-1380, 2002). In addition variants in the 5′ flanking region and the first intron are modestly associated with increased schizophrenia vulnerability (Owen et al, Psychiatric genetics and genomics, 247-266, 2002). The mechanism of susceptibility to schizophrenia remains unclear. However, the RSG4 gene product down-regulates effects at G-protein-coupled receptor including the dopamine and serotonin receptors. Furthermore, RSG4 expression is modulated by stress (Ni et al, J Neurosci, 19(10):3674-3680, 1999) and is a known contributor factor to major metal illness, including bi-polar disorder (Berrettini, Am J Med Genet, 123C:59-64, 2003; Shifman et al, Am J Hum Genet, 71:1296-1303, 2002). Therefore, it is possible that RSG4 plays a role through these pathways to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia.
  [0010]  Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is localized to chromosomal region 22q11 and has been identified as the second greatest risk factor for mental illness (Bassett et al, Biol Psychiatry, 46:882-891, 1999; Murphy K C, Lancet, 359:426-430, 2002). COMT catalyzes the O-methylation of catecholamine neurotransmitters and catechol hormones leading to their inactivation. In addition, COMT also shortens the biological half-lives of certain neuroactive drugs, like L-DOPA, alpha-methyl DOPA and isoproterenol. Reports implicating the role of COMT in schizophrenia have been inconsistent, however, the weight of evidence seems to favour the involvement of COMT in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Shifman et al, supra 2002). A functional variant has been demonstrated to play a role in regulating aspects of cognitive functioning (Egan et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 98(12):6917-6922, 2001) and it has been proposed that decreased expression of COMT is involved in schizophrenia (Bray et al, Am J Hum Genet, 73(J):152-161, 2003). In addition, COMT has been implicated in schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder implying that these conditions share some genetic vulnerability factors (Berrettini, supra 2003; Shifman et al, supra 2002). However, the pathogenic mechanisms of COMT are yet to be fully elucidated. Imbalances in glutamate have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. The metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (GRM3) is a receptor for glutamate and has been mapped to chromosome 7q21.1 (Scherer et al, Genomics, 31:230-233, 1996) and may contribute to a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia (Marti et al, Am J Med Genet, 144:46-50, 2002; Fujii Y et al, Psychiatr Genet, 13:71-76, 2003).
  [0011]  Genetic analysis has implicated the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene with a spectrum of major mental illness including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar affective disorder and major depression. Emerging evidence from these studies have identified a casual relationship between DISC1 and directly measurable traits such as working memory, cognitive aging decreased gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex, abnormalities in hippocampal structure and function and a reduction in the amplitude of the P300 event-related potential. DISC1 binds to a number of proteins involved in essential functions of neuronal function including neural migration, neurite outgrowth, cytoskeletal modulation and signal transduction (Yamada et al, Biol Psychiatry, 56:683-690, 2004; Millar et al, Science, 310:1187-1191, 2005).
  [0012]  5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 2A (HTR2A) has been implicated as a functional candidate in many neuropsychiatric phenotypes including: schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), affective disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicide and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Norton et al, Ann Med, 37(2):121-129, 2005). HTR2A is one of the several different receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), a biogenic hormone that functions as a neurotransmitter, a hormone, and a mitogen. The HTR2A receptor mediates its action by association with G proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
  [0013]  A number of other genes have been associated with an increased susceptibility to schizophrenia. For example, associations between SNPs, haplotypes and mis-sense mutations have been associated with schizophrenia with the proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) gene (Liu et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. USA, 99:3717-3722, 2002). In addition, mice with an inactive PRODH gene have abnormalities of sensorimotor gating similar to those in humans that some consider a trait marker for schizophrenia (Gogos et al, Nat Genet, 21:434-439). A recent study of the karyopherin alpha 3 (KPNA3) gene, which functions in nuclear protein import as an adapter protein for nuclear receptor KPNB1, has implicated that it may contribute genetically to schizophrenia in a mall effect size (Wei et al, Neurosci Res, 52:342-346, 2005).
  [0014]  The present invention now provides a profile of risk factors and therapeutic targets useful in the diagnosis, treatment, monitoring and therapeutic drug development of neurological, psychiatric and psychological conditions, phenotypes and states.
 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
 [0015]  Throughout this specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word “comprise”, or variations such as “comprises” or “comprising”, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element or integer or group of elements or integers but not the exclusion of any other element or integer or group of elements or integers.
  [0016]  The present invention identifies a genetic link between genes encoding enzymes and receptors in dopaminergic pathways including and those genes related to GABAergic, glutamatergic, and serotonergic function which are likely to influence dopaminergic pathways and a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. In particular, a population of individuals having related pathopsychological symptoms and behavioral patterns are shown to exhibit a particular polymorphism with the genetic regions of these genes. Even more particularly, the present invention identifies a ranking or profile of markers prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia or related neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions including anxiety disorders, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and addictions including alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, and opioid dependence. Reference to a condition related to schizophrenia includes a condition having similar symptoms, underlying genetic cause or association and/or treatment rationale. The ranking or profile of markers enables stratification of individuals and groups of individuals including related individuals with respect to a disease condition, risk of developing a disease condition or the likelihood that an individual would be responsive to a particular treatment regime. The markers themselves are also potential drug targets.
  [0017]  Accordingly, the present invention contemplates a method for identifying a genetic profile associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state including a sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state in an individual or a group of individuals, said method comprising screening individuals for a polymorphism including a mutation in a gene selected from the list in Table 2, including its 5′ and 3′ terminal regions, promoter, introns and exons which has a statistically significant linkage or association to symptoms or behavior characterizing the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold forms thereof. Reference herein to “a gene” includes one or more or all genes listed in Table 2. There may be multiple polymorphisms in one or more genes or a single polymorphism in each or a few genes.
  [0018]  In one particular embodiment, the genetic profile comprises from about one to about 100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in one or more genes listed in Table 2. In another embodiment, the genetic profile is a distribution panel as outlined in Table 3 or an individual gene therein. In another embodiment, the genetic profile comprises from one to 100 single or multiple nucleotide mutations such as insertions, additions, substitutions and deletions as well as rearrangements or microsatellites. All such nucleotide modifications are referred to herein as a “polymorphism”. Table 4 provides allele-distribution of control and schizophrenia patients.
  [0019]  Neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions, phenotypes and states include, but are not limited to, addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, smoking dependence and social phobia.
  [0020]  The present invention is particularly exemplified herein with respect to schizophrenia, anxiety disorder (eg PTSD), alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence and opioid dependence. These conditions are associated with polymorphisms in the genetic loci listed in Table 2 including 5′ and 3′ terminal regions, promoter, introns and exons therein. However, the present invention extends to the use of polymorphisms to profile individuals with respect to a range of conditions such as those listed above. In a particular embodiment, the genetic profile comprises one or more polymorphisms in two or more genes listed in Table 3. Reference to “one or more” includes from about one to about 100.
  [0021]  In an even more particular embodiment, the genetic profile is the panel in Table 3.
  [0022]  The present invention enables clinicians to make a genetic-based diagnosis of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a risk or likelihood that an individual will develop such a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. The invention allows the targeted implementation of treatment or preventative interventions including medication and cognitive-behavioral therapy to reduce the adverse consequences of the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0023]  In addition, the identification of polymorphisms including mutations in genes associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state enables agents to be identified which mask the physiological impact or consequences of the genetic profile. Consequently, agents which modulate levels of expressions of these genes are proposed to be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia, substance dependence, affective disorder, anxiety disorder or other neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions, phenotypes or states.
  [0024]  Still further, the present invention enables individuals in therapy to be monitored and/or their treatment tailored depending on the presence of particular polymorphisms. Hence, the instant invention extends to personalized medicine and pharmacogenomic analysis and screening.
  [0025]  Accordingly, the present invention contemplates a method a method for determining the likelihood of a subject responding favorably to a particular drug in the treatment of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state said method comprising obtaining or extracting a DNA sample from cells of said individual and screening for or otherwise detecting the presence of from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 including their 5′ or 3′ terminal region, promoter, intron or exons which with a statistical significant association with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state wherein the presence of the polymorphism profile is indicative of the likelihood of the drug being effective.
  [0026]  The present invention further provides a method for identifying a genetic basis behind diagnosing or treating a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state in an individual, said method comprising obtaining a biological sample from said individual and detecting a protein encoded by a nucleotide sequence having from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 or Table 3 including their 5′ or 3′ terminal region, promoter, intron or exons with a statistical significant association with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state resulting in from about one to about 100 amino acid insertions, substitutions or deletions wherein the presence of an altered amino acid sequence is indicative of the presence of a polymorphism and the likelihood of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0027]  As indicated above, reference to a “polymorphism” includes, in one embodiment, a SNP; in another embodiment, a multiple nucleotide polymorphism (MNP); and in yet another embodiment, any nucleotide mutation such as an insertion, addition, substitution or deletion as well as rearrangements or microsatellites.
  [0028]  Reference to genes associated with schizophrenia, PTSD, alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence or other neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions, phenotypes or states maybe referred to herein as targets, genetic loci, alleles or a panel of genes.
  [0029]  In a particular embodiment, Table 3 provides a panel of genes and polymorphisms ranked according to diagnostic significance. However, the present invention extends to one or more polymorphisms in one or more particularly two or more genes in Table 3.
  [0030]  Microarrays, gene arrays and other high throughput diagnostic assays also form part of the present invention together with diagnostic and therapeutic kits.
  [0031]  Nucleotide and amino acid sequences are referred to by a sequence identifier number (SEQ ID NO). The SEQ ID NOs correspond numerically to the sequence identifiers <400>1 (SEQ ID NO:1), <400>2 (SEQ ID NO:2), etc. A summary of the sequence identifiers is provided in Table 1. A sequence listing is provided after the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
 [0033]  The singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include single and plural aspects unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a polymorphism” includes a single polymorphism, as well as two or more polymorphisms; reference to “an association” includes a single association or multiple associations; reference to “the psychological phenotype” includes a single psychological phenotype, as well as two or more psychological phenotypes, and so on. In addition, reference to “the invention” includes single or multiple aspects of an invention.
  [0034]  The present invention is predicated in part on the identification of genetic profiles having a statistically significant association with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state including a sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. However, the genetic profile is an indicator of an underlying biochemical or metabolic state that is responsible for the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state including a sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. By “genetic profiles” is meant that groups of individuals exhibiting a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold forms thereof or who are at the risk of developing same exhibit a common polymorphism at or within one or genes selected from the list in Table 2 including its 5′ or 3′ terminal regions, promoter, exons or introns. The genetic profile may be a single polymorphism or multiple polymorphisms in a single gene or in a panel of genes, that is two or more polymorphisms in one or more genes that are statistically significantly linked to a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold forms thereof. Reference to a polymorphism in this context includes a mutation. A mutation includes and is encompassed by the term “polymorphism”, a nucleotide insertion, addition, substitution and deletion as well as a rearrangement or microsatellite.
  [0035]  In a particular embodiment, the genetic profile comprises from about one to about 15 genes as listed in Table 2 such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 genes. More particularly, the genetic profile comprises one or more polymorphisms in one or more of the 9 genes as defined in Table 3. The profile may be, therefore, a panel of polymorphisms. A given gene may also contain more than one polymorphism or there may be a polymorphism in each gene. Hence, the present invention extends to the identification of from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes.
  [0036]  Although the genes shown in Table 3 are given a ranking this should in no way limit the diagnostic method of determining a mutation in these genes in any particular order. It is important to note that the present invention extends to a single gene in Table 2 or 3 or two or more genes in Table 2 or 3. With respect to the ranking in Table 3, again, all genes may be considered or a combination of two or more may be used.
  [0037]  Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention contemplates a method for identifying a genetic profile associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state including a sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state in an individual or a group of individuals, said method comprising screening individuals for a polymorphism including a mutation in a gene selected from the list in Table 2, including its 5′ and 3′ terminal regions, promoter, introns and exons which has a statistically significant linkage or association to symptoms or behavior characterizing the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold forms thereof.
  [0038]  The genetic locus comprising the genes listed in Tables 2 and 3 may be referred to as the “gene”, “nucleic acid”, “locus”, “genetic locus” or “polynucleotide”. Each refers to polynucleotides, all of which are in the gene region including its 5′ or 3′ terminal regions, promoter, introns or exons. Accordingly, the genes of the present invention are intended to include coding sequences, intervening sequences and regulatory elements controlling transcription and/or translation. A genetic locus is intended to include all allelic variations of the DNA sequence on either or both chromosomes. Consequently, homozygous and heterozygous variations of the instant genetic loci are contemplated herein.
  [0039]  As indicated above, the present invention provides a genetic panel comprising different profiles of genes or mutations therein for different neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions, phenotypes or states or sub-threshold forms thereof. Such profiles include polymorphisms, although any nucleotide substitution, addition, deletion or insertion or other mutation in one or more genetic loci is encompassed by the present invention when associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. Accordingly, the present invention extends to rare mutations which although not present in larger numbers of individuals in a population, when the mutation is present, it leads to a very high likelihood of development of a pathopsychological disorder. The present invention is not to be limited to all the genes in the genetic panel. A single gene or two or more genes in Table 2 or the entire panel or one and more particularly two or more genes in Table 3 may be used in accordance with the present invention.
  [0040]  The term “polymorphism” or “mutation” refers to a difference in a DNA or RNA sequence or sequences among individuals, groups or populations which give rise to a statistically significant phenotype or physiological condition. Examples of genetic polymorphisms include mutations that result by chance or are induced by external features. These polymorphisms or mutations may be indicative of a disease or disorder and may arise following a genetic disease, a chromosomal abnormality, a genetic predisposition, a viral infection, a fungal infection, a bacterial infection or a protist infection or following chemotherapy, radiation therapy or substance abuse including alcohol or drug abuse. The polymorphisms may also dictate or contribute to symptoms with a psychological phenotype. In a preferred aspect, the polymorphisms of the present invention are indicative of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold condition, phenotype or state thereof. As used herein, polymorphisms including mutations may refer to one or more changes in a DNA or RNA sequence which are present in a group of individuals having a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold forms thereof or are at risk of developing same.
  [0041]  Examples of nucleotide changes contemplated herein include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multiple nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), frame shift mutations, including insertions and deletions (also called deletion insertion polymorphisms or DIPS), nucleotide substitutions, nonsense mutations, rearrangements and microsatellites. Two or more polymorphisms may also be used either at the same allele (i.e. haplotypes) or at different alleles. All these mutations are encompassed by the term “polymorphism”.
  [0042]  Examples of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state contemplated by the present invention and which may be directly or indirectly linked to a genetic profile such as a polymorphism or mutation related to dopamine pathway function and genes that influence the function of associated neurotransmitters GABA, glutamate, serotonin including but are not limited to addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, smoking dependence and social phobia. It should be noted, however, that a person considered not to suffer any symptom associated with the above disorders still falls within the scope of a “normal” or a non-symptomatic or non-pathogenic neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0043]  Exemplified conditions herein are schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, nicotine dependence, alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. Reference herein to “schizophrenia” includes conditions which have symptoms similar to schizophrenia and hence are regard as schizophrenia-related conditions. Such symptoms of schizophrenia include behavioral and physiological conditions. A related condition may also have a common underlying genetic cause or association and/or a common treatment rationale. Due to the composition of schizophrenia and related conditions, the ability to identify a genetic profile to assist in defining schizophrenia is of significant importance. The present invention now provides this genetic profile. Further identification of potential genetic profiles may include a predisposition to developing a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state selected from addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, and social phobia.
  [0044]  Any number of methods may be used to calculate the statistical significance of a polymorphism and its association with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition. Particular statistical analysis methods which may be used are described in Fisher and vanBelle, “Biostatistics: A Methodology for the Health Sciences” Wiley-Intersciences (New York) 1993. This analysis may also include a regression calculation of which polymorphic sites in the gene profile which gives the most significant contribution to the differences in phenotype. One regression model useful in the invention starts with a model of the form
  [0000]    r=r 0+(S×d)
  [0000]  where r is the response, r0 is a constant called the “intercept”, S is the slope and d is the dose. To determine the dose, the most-common and least common nucleotides at the polymorphic site are first defined. Then, for each individual in the trial population, one calculates a “dose” as the number of least-common nucleotides the individual has at the polymorphic site of interest. This value can be 0 (homozygous for the least-common nucleotide), 1 (heterozygous), or 2 (homozygous for the most common nucleotide). An individual's “response” is the value of the clinical measurement. Standard linear regression methods are then used to fit all the individuals' doses and responses to a single model (see e.g. Fisher and vanBelle, supra, Ch 9). The outputs of the regression calculation are the intercept r0, the slope S, and the variance (which measures how well the data fits this simple linear model). The Students t-test value and the level of significance can then be calculated for each of the polymorphic sites.
  [0045]  In relation to the genetic profile associated with schizophrenia, alcoholism or a related condition or other neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state, the present invention encompasses a ranking comprising a polymorphism or mutation in a particular group of genes such as from about one to about 100 polymorphisms including the SNPs exemplified in Table 2. More particularly four to 15 genes may be used. In a particular embodiment, the ranking comprises the genes listed in Table 3 or a combination of two or more of the genes. Reference to “gene” includes its 5′ or 3′ terminal regions, promoter, introns and exons.
  [0046]  The present invention provides a genetic marker set for a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, state or phenotype in an individual wherein the genetic marker is selected from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes as listed in Table 2 or more particularly in one or more genes listed in Table 3. It is proposed that these polymorphisms are indicative of, or a predisposition of developing a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state selected from addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, smoking dependence and social phobia. It should be noted, however, that a person considered not to suffer any symptom associated with the above disorders still falls within the scope of a “normal” or a non-symptomatic or non-pathogenic neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0047]  In one embodiment, the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state is schizophrenia or alcoholism or a related condition.
  [0048]  In a particular embodiment the condition is schizophrenia or a related condition.
  [0049]  Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a panel of genetic mutations providing a genetic marker set for schizophrenia or a related condition in an individual said genetic marker comprising from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 wherein the presence of the polymorphisms is indicative of or a predisposition to developing.
  [0050]  In a related aspect, the present invention provides a method for detecting the presence of, or the propensity to develop a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or sub-threshold form thereof, wherein the condition, phenotype or state results from or is exacerbated by any insertion or deletion at the site of a polymorphism in a gene selected from Table 2 or more particularly in the genes selected in Table 3 including its 5′ or 3′ terminal regions, promoter, exons or introns. Insertions or deletions may involve a single nucleotide or more than one such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100 nucleotides within the region of interest. Rearrangements, microsatellites and other nucleotide insertions, additions, substitutions or deletions may also occur.
  [0051]  In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a nonsense mutation which includes the introduction of a stop codon.
  [0052]  A neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold form thereof involving one or more genes from Table 2 or Table 3 or a risk of developing such a condition, phenotype or state may be ascertained by screening any tissue from an individual for genetic material carrying the genetic locus for the presence of a polymorphism including a mutation which is associated with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof or a pre-disposition for development of same. Schizophrenia is an example of a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. Most conveniently, buccal cells are obtained or blood is drawn and DNA extracted from the cells. In addition, prenatal diagnosis can be accomplished by testing foetal cells, placental cells or amniotic cells for a polymorphism in one or more genes to detect the presence of a genetic profile comprising from about one to about 100 polymorphisms such as the SNPs exemplified in Table 2 or more particularly in one or more genes from Table 3.
  [0053]  Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention contemplates a method for diagnosing a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state in an individual, said method comprising obtaining or extracting DNA sample from cells of said individual and screening for or otherwise detecting the presence of a genetic profile comprising from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 such as a ranking of two or more polymorphisms in the genes listed in Table 3 with a statistically significant association with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state wherein the presence of that genetic profile is indicative of the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof or that the individual is at risk of developing same.
  [0054]  Generally, the genetic test is part of an overall diagnostic protocol involving clinical assessment and diagnostic tools such as pencil-and-paper tests. Consequently, this aspect of the present invention may be considered as a confirmatory test or part of a series of tests in the final diagnosis of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0055]  Accordingly, another aspect of the present invention provides a diagnostic assay for a genetic profile predetermined to be associated with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state said method comprising obtaining or extracting a DNA sample from cells of said individual and screening for or otherwise detecting the presence of from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 such as a ranking of two or more polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 3 which has a statistically significant association with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state wherein the presence of that genetic profile is indicative of the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof or that the individual is at risk of developing same.
  [0056]  As indicated above, the genetic profile is generally detecting polymorphisms in a range of genes ranked in order of statistically significance in its association with its disorder. Any polymorphism or mutation such as those contemplated in Tables 1 and 2 and which are found to be associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state is encompassed by the present invention. In addition, examples of neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions, phenotypes and states include but are not limited to addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, smoking dependence and social phobia. It should be noted, however, that a person considered not to suffer any symptom associated with the above disorders still falls within the scope of a “normal” or a non-symptomatic or non-pathogenic neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0057]  Schizophrenia, anxiety disorder, and alcohol dependence, nicotine dependence and opioid dependence are particularly contemplated by the present invention.
  [0058]  Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method for diagnosing a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or, state including schizophrenia in an individual or a risk of development of same, said method comprising obtaining or extracting a DNA sample from cells of said individual and screening for or otherwise detecting the presence of a polymorphism in cDNA molecule corresponding to from one to 15 genes in Table 2 such two or more genes in Table 3 wherein the presence of a set of polymorphisms in the one to 15 genes is indicative of the individual having or at risk of developing an adverse neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state selected from addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, smoking dependence and social phobia.
  [0059]  The method and assay of the present invention are further directed to detecting the form of the polymorphism in an individual associated with “normal” behavior. In other words, an individual which may be at risk such as through his or her genetic lines or because of substance abuse or who has behavioral tendencies which suggest a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state can be screened for the presence of a polymorphism such as from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in from one to 15 genes as listed in Table 2 such as two or more polymorphisms in one or more genes in Table 3 wherein the presence of the profile of polymorphisms is at least suggestive of a genetic basis for any symptoms associated with the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state for which the individual first presented to a clinician.
  [0060]  Reference to “1 to 15 genes” includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 genes.
  [0061]  A “neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state” may be an adverse condition or may represent “normal” behavior. The latter constitutes behavior consistent with societal “norms”.
  [0062]  Reference herein to an “individual” includes a human which may also be considered a subject, patient, host, recipient or target.
  [0063]  The present invention enables, therefore, a stratification of individuals based on a genetic profile. The stratification or profiling enables early diagnosis, conformation of a clinical diagnosis, treatment monitoring and treatment selection for a neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions phenotype or state.
  [0064]  There are many methods which may be used to detect a DNA sequence profile. Direct DNA sequencing, either manual sequencing or automated fluorescent sequencing can detect sequence variation including a polymorphism or mutation. Another approach is the single-stranded conformation polymorphism assay (SSCP) (Orita, et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 86:2766-2770, 1989). This method does not detect all sequence changes, especially if the DNA fragment size is greater than 200 bp, but can be optimized to detect most DNA sequence variation. The reduced detection sensitivity is a disadvantage, but the increased throughput possible with SSCP makes it an attractive, viable alternative to direct sequencing for mutation detection. The fragments which have shifted mobility on SSCP gels are then sequenced to determine the exact nature of the DNA sequence variation. Other approaches based on the detection of mismatches between the two complementary DNA strands include clamped denaturing gel electrophoresis (CDGE) (Sheffield et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:232-236, 1989), heteroduplex analysis (HA) (White et al, Genomics 12:301-306, 1992) and chemical mismatch cleavage (CMC) (Grompe et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:5855-5892, 1989). None of the methods described above detects large deletions, duplications or insertions, nor will they detect a mutation in a regulatory region or a gene. Other methods which would detect these classes of mutations include a protein truncation assay or the asymmetric assay. A review of currently available methods of detecting DNA sequence variation can be found in Kwok (Curr Issues Mol. Biol. 5(2):43-60, 2003, Twyman and Primrose (Pharmacogenomics. 4(1):67-79, 2003), Edwards and Bartlett (Methods Mol. Biol. 226:287-294, 2003) and Brennan (Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 1(4):395-302, 2001). Once a mutation is known, an allele-specific detection approach such as allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization can be utilized to rapidly screen large numbers of other samples for that same mutation. Such a technique can utilize probes which are labeled with gold nanoparticles or any other reporter molecule to yield a visual color result (Elghanian et al, Science 277:1078-1081, 1997).
  [0065]  A rapid preliminary analysis to detect polymorphisms in DNA sequences can be performed by looking at a series of Southern blots of DNA cut with one or more restriction enzymes, preferably with a large number of restriction enzymes. Each blot contains a series of normal individuals and a series of individuals having neurologic or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders or any other neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. Southern blots displaying hybridizing fragments (differing in length from control DNA when probed with sequences near or to the genetic locus being tested) indicate a possible mutation or polymorphism. If restriction enzymes which produce very large restriction fragments are used, then pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is employed. Alternatively, the desired region of the genetic locus being tested can be amplified, the resulting amplified products can be cut with a restriction enzyme and the size of fragments produced for the different polymorphisms can be determined.
  [0066]  Detection of point mutations may be accomplished by molecular cloning of the target genes and sequencing the alleles using techniques well known in the art. Also, the gene or portions of the gene may be amplified, e.g., by PCR or other amplification technique, and the amplified gene or amplified portions of the gene may be sequenced.
  [0067]  Methods for a more complete, yet still indirect, test for confirming the presence of a susceptibility allele include: 1) single-stranded conformation analysis (SSCP) (Orita et al, supra 1989); 2) denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) (Wartell et al, Nucl. Acids Res. 18:2699-2705, 1990; Sheffield et al, supra 1989); 3) RNase protection assays (Finkelstein et al, Genomics 7:167-172, 1990; Kinszler et al, Science 251:1366-1370, 1991); 4) allele-specific oligonucleotides [ASOs] (Conner et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:278-282, 1983); 5) the use of proteins which recognize nucleotide mismatches, such as the E. coli mutS protein (Modrich Ann. Rev. Genet. 25:229-253, 1991); 6) allele-specific PCR (Ruano and Kidd, Nucl. Acids Res. 17:8392, 1989); and 7) PCR amplification of the site of the polymorphism followed by digestion using a restriction endonuclease that cuts or fails to cut when the variant allele is present.
  [0068]  Additionally, real-time PCR such as the allele specific kinetic real-time PCR assay can be used or allele specific real-time TaqMan probes.
  [0069]  For allele-specific PCR, primers are used which hybridize at their 3′ ends to a particular target genetic locus or mutation. If the particular polymorphism or mutation is not present, an amplification product is not observed. Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) can also be used, as disclosed in European Patent Application Publication No. 0332435. Insertions and deletions of genes can also be detected by cloning, sequencing and amplification. In addition, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes for the gene or surrounding marker genes can be used to score alteration of an allele or an insertion in a polymorphic fragment. Such a method is particularly useful for screening relatives of an affected individual for the presence of the mutation found in that individual. Other techniques for detecting insertions and deletions as known in the art can be used.
  [0070]  In SSCP, DGGE and the RNase protection assay, an electrophoretic band appears which is absent if the polymorphism or mutation is not present. SSCP detects a band which migrates differentially because the sequence change causes a difference in single-strand, intramolecular base pairing. RNase protection involves cleavage of the mutant polynucleotide into two or more smaller fragments. DGGE detects differences in migration rates of mutant sequences compared to wild-type sequences, using a denaturing gradient gel. In an allele-specific oligonucleotide assay, an oligonucleotide is designed which detects a specific sequence, and the assay is performed by detecting the presence or absence of a hybridization signal, In the mutS assay, the protein binds only to sequences that contain a nucleotide mismatch in a heteroduplex between mutant and wild-type sequences.
  [0071]  Mismatches, according to the present invention, are hybridized nucleic acid duplexes in which the two strands are not 100% complementary. Lack of total homology may be due to deletions, insertions, inversions or substitutions. Mismatch detection can be used to detect point mutations in the gene or in its mRNA product. While these techniques are less sensitive than sequencing, they are simpler to perform on a large number of samples. An example of a mismatch cleavage technique is the RNase protection method. In the practice of the present invention, the method involves the use of a labeled riboprobe which is complementary to the human wild-type genes (i.e. such as those listed in Table 2). The riboprobe and either mRNA or DNA isolated from the person are annealed (hybridized) together and subsequently digested with the enzyme RNase A which is able to detect some mismatches in a duplex RNA structure. If a mismatch is detected by RNase A, it cleaves at the site of the mismatch. Thus, when the annealed RNA preparation is separated on an electrophoretic gel matrix, if a mismatch has been detected and cleaved by RNase A, an RNA product will be seen which is smaller than the full length duplex RNA for the riboprobe and the mRNA or DNA. The riboprobe need not be the full length of the mRNA or gene but can be a segment of either. If the riboprobe comprises only a segment of the mRNA or gene, it will be desirable to use a number of these probes to screen the whole mRNA sequence for mismatches.
  [0072]  In similar fashion, DNA probes can be used to detect mismatches, through enzymatic or chemical cleavage (see, for example, Cotton et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:4033-40371988; Shenk et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 72:989-993, 1975; Novack et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:586-590, 1986). Alternatively, mismatches can be detected by shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of mismatched duplexes relative to matched duplexes (see, for example, Cariello Am. J. Human Genetics 42:726-734, 1988). With either riboprobes or DNA probes, the cellular mRNA or DNA which might contain a mutation can be amplified using PCR (see below) before hybridization. Changes in DNA of the associated genetic polymorphisms or genetic loci can also be detected using Southern blot hybridization, especially if the changes are gross rearrangements, such as deletions and insertions.
  [0073]  DNA sequences of the DRD2, DTNBP1, GABRA1, DAT, COMT, RGS4, KPNA3, AKT1, HTR2A, PRODH, ANKK1, DISC1 and GRM3 genes which have been amplified by use of PCR may also be screened using allele-specific probes. These probes are nucleic acid oligomers, each of which contains a region of the gene sequence harboring a known mutation. For example, one oligomer may be from about three to about 100 nucleotides in length such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. An oligomer of about 20 nucleotides in length is particularly convenient. These oligomers correspond to a portion of the gene sequence. By use of a battery of such allele-specific probes, PCR amplification products can be screened to identify the presence of a previously identified mutation in the gene. Hybridization of allele-specific probes with amplified target gene sequences can be performed, for example, on a nylon filter. Hybridization to a particular probe under high stringency hybridization conditions indicates the presence of the same mutation in the tissue as in the allele-specific probe.
  [0074]  Once the site containing the polymorphisms has been amplified, the SNPs can also be detected by primer extension. Here a primer is annealed immediately adjacent to the variant site, and the 5′ end is extended a single base pair by incubation with di-deoxytrinucleotides. Whether the extended base was a A, T, G or C can then be determined by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) or fluorescent flow cytometric analysis (Taylor et al, Biotechniques 30:661-669, 2001) or other techniques.
  [0075]  Nucleic acid analysis via microchip technology is also applicable to the present invention. In this technique, thousands of distinct oligonucleotide probes are built up in an array on a silicon chip. Nucleic acids to be analyzed are fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the probes on the chip. It is also possible to study nucleic acid-protein interactions using these nucleic acid microchips. Using this technique, one can determine the presence of mutations or even sequence the nucleic acid being analyzed or one can measure expression levels of a gene of interest. The method is one of parallel processing of many, including thousands, of probes at once and can tremendously increase the rate of analysis.
  [0076]  The most definitive test for mutations in the target loci is to directly compare genomic sequences from patients with those from a control population. Alternatively, one can sequence mRNA after amplification, e.g., by PCR, thereby eliminating the necessity of determining the exon structure of the candidate gene.
  [0077]  Mutations falling outside the coding region of the target loci can be detected by examining the non-coding regions, such as introns and regulatory sequences near or within the genes. An early indication that mutations in non-coding regions are important may come from Northern blot experiments that reveal messenger RNA molecules of abnormal size or abundance in patients as compared to those of control individuals.
  [0078]  Alteration of mRNA expression from the genetic loci can be detected by any techniques known in the art. These include Northern blot analysis, PCR amplification and RNase protection. Diminished mRNA expression indicates an alteration of the wild-type gene. It is worth noting that the DRD2 957C>T polymorphism has been shown to increase mRNA stability in vitro (Duan et al, Hum Mol Genet. 12:205-16, 2003) and that this could result in a detectable change in steady-state DRD2 mRNA levels in vivo. Alteration of wild-type genes can also be detected by screening for alteration of wild-type protein. For example, monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive with a target protein (i.e. a protein encoded by a gene in Table 2 or two or more proteins from the genes in Table 2 or 3) can be used to screen a tissue. Lack of cognate antigen or a reduction in the levels of antigen would indicate a mutation. Antibodies specific for products of mutant alleles could also be used to detect mutant gene product. Such immunological assays can be done in any convenient formats known in the art. These include Western blots, immunohistochemical assays and ELISA assays. Any means for detecting an altered protein can be used to detect alteration of the wild-type protein. Functional assays, such as protein binding determinations, can be used. In addition, assays can be used which detect the protein biochemical function. Finding a mutant gene product indicates alteration of a wild-type gene product.
  [0079]  Hence, the present invention further extends to a method for identifying a genetic basis behind diagnosing or treating a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state in an individual, said method comprising obtaining a biological sample from said individual and detecting a protein encoded by a nucleotide sequence having from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 including their 5′ or 3′ terminal region, promoter, intron or exons with a statistical significant association with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state resulting in from about one to about 100 amino acid insertions, substitutions or deletions wherein the presence of an altered amino acid sequence is indicative of the presence of a polymorphism and the likelihood of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0080]  The altered amino acid sequence may be detected via specific antibodies which can discriminate between the presence or absence of an amino acid change, by amino acid sequencing, by a change in protein activity or cell phenotype and/or via the presence of particular metabolites if the protein is associated with a biochemical pathway.
  [0081]  A mutant gene or corresponding gene products can also be detected in other human body samples which contain DNA, such as serum, stool, urine and sputum. The same techniques discussed above for detection of mutant genes or gene products in tissues can be applied to other body samples. By screening such body samples, an early diagnosis can be achieved for subjects at risk of developing a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold forms thereof.
  [0082]  Primer pairs disclosed herein are useful for determination of the nucleotide sequence of a particular target gene using PCR. The pairs of single-stranded DNA primers can be annealed to sequences within or surrounding the gene in order to prime amplifying DNA synthesis of the gene itself. A complete set of these primers allows synthesis of all of the nucleotides of the gene coding sequences, i.e., the exons. The set of primers preferably allows synthesis of both intron and exon sequences. Allele-specific primers can also be used. Such primers anneal only to particular polymorphic or mutant alleles, and thus will only amplify a product in the presence of the polymorphic or mutant allele as a template.
  [0083]  In order to facilitate subsequent cloning of amplified sequences, primers may have restriction enzyme site sequences appended to their 5′ ends. Thus, all nucleotides of the primers are derived from the gene sequence or sequences adjacent the gene, except for the few nucleotides necessary to form a restriction enzyme site. Such enzymes and sites are well known in the art. The primers themselves can be synthesized using techniques which are well known in the art. Generally, the primers can be made using oligonucleotide synthesizing machines which are commercially available. Given the sequence of each gene and polymorphisms described herein, design of particular primers is well within the skill of the art. The present invention adds to this by presenting data on the intron/exon boundaries thereby allowing one to design primers to amplify and sequence all of the exonic regions completely.
  [0084]  The nucleic acid probes provided by the present invention are useful for a number of purposes. They can be used in Southern blot hybridization to genomic DNA and in the RNase protection method for detecting point mutations already discussed above. The probes can be used to detect PCR amplification products. They may also be used to detect mismatches in the target genes or mRNA using other techniques.
  [0085]  The present invention identifies the presence of altered (or mutant) genetic loci associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state, including schizophrenia or a sub-threshold form thereof or an individual of risk of developing same. In order to detect a target genes or mutation, a biological sample is prepared and analyzed for a difference between the sequence of the allele being analyzed and the sequence of the “wild-type” allele. In this context, a “wild-type” allele includes the nucleotide at a given position most commonly represented in the population and for which there is not direct evidence for these individuals having the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state under investigation. Polymorphic or mutant alleles can be initially identified by any of the techniques described above. The polymorphic or mutant alleles may then be sequenced to identify the specific polymorphism or mutation of the particular allele. Alternatively, polymorphic or mutant alleles can be initially identified by identifying polymorphic or mutant (altered) proteins, using conventional techniques. The polymorphisms or mutations, especially those statistically associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof are then used for the diagnostic and prognostic methods of the present invention.
  [0086]  As used herein, the phrase “amplifying” refers to increasing the content of a specific genetic region of interest within a sample. The amplification of the genetic region of interest may be performed using any method of amplification known to those of skill in the relevant art. In a preferred aspect, the present method for detecting a polymorphism utilizes PCR as the amplification step.
  [0087]  PCR amplification utilizes primers to amplify a genetic region of interest. Reference herein to a “primer” is not to be taken as any limitation to structure, size or function. Reference to primers herein, includes reference to a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides comprising at least three nucleotides. Generally, the primers comprises from about three to about 100 nucleotides, preferably from about five to about 50 nucleotides and even more preferably from about 10 to about 25 nucleotides such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100 nucleotides. The primers of the present invention may be synthetically produced by, for example, the stepwise addition of nucleotides or may be fragments, parts or portions or extension products of other nucleic acid molecules. The term “primer” is used in its most general sense to include any length of nucleotides which, when used for amplification purposes, can provide free 3′ hydroxyl group for the initiation of DNA synthesis by a DNA polymerase. DNA synthesis results in the extension of the primer to produce a primer extension product complementary to the nucleic acid strand to which the primer has annealed or hybridized.
  [0088]  Accordingly, the present invention extends to an isolated oligonucleotide which comprises from about three to about 100 consecutive nucleotides from the gene or its corresponding cDNA or mRNA as listed in Table 2 such as the groups of two or more genes in Table 3 which encompass at least one polymorphism or mutation associated with or otherwise likely to be found in individuals with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state such as those selected from normal behavior, addiction, dementia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, PTSD, phobias, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, alcohol dependence (alcoholism), amphetamine dependence, brief psychotic disorder, cannabis dependence, cocaine dependence, cyclothymic disorder, delirium, delusional disorder, dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, hallucinogen dependence, major depressive disorder, nicotine dependence, opioid dependence, paranoid personality disorder, Parkinson's disease, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder, schizophreniform disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, sedative dependence, shared psychotic disorder, smoking dependence and social phobia. It should be noted, however, that a person considered not to suffer any symptom associated with the above disorders still falls within the scope of a “normal” or a non-symptomatic or non-pathogenic neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state.
  [0089]  In a preferred embodiment, one of the at least two primers is involved in an amplification reaction to amplify a target sequence. If this primer is also labeled with a reporter molecule, the amplification reaction will result in the incorporation of any of the label into the amplified product. The terms “amplification product” and “amplicon” may be used interchangeably.
  [0090]  The primers and the amplicons of the present invention may also be modified in a manner which provides either a detectable signal or aids in the purification of the amplified product.
  [0091]  A range of labels providing a detectable signal may be employed. The label may be associated with a primer or amplicon or it may be attached to an intermediate which subsequently binds to the primer or amplicon. The label may be selected from a group including a chromogen, a catalyst, an enzyme, a fluorophore, a luminescent molecule, a chemiluminescent molecule, a lanthanide ion such as Europium (Eu34), a radioisotope and a direct visual label. In the case of a direct visual label, use may be made of a colloidal metallic or non-metallic particular, a dye particle, an enzyme or a substrate, an organic polymer, a latex particle, a liposome, or other vesicle containing a signal producing substance and the like. A large number of enzymes suitable for use as labels is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,366,241, 4,843,000 and 4,849,338. Suitable enzyme labels useful in the present invention include alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, β-galactosidase, glucose oxidase, lysozyme, malate dehydrogenase and the like. The enzyme label may be used alone or in combination with a second enzyme which is in solution. Alternatively, a fluorophore which may be used as a suitable label in accordance with the present invention includes, but is not limited to, fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC), and the fluorochrome is selected from FITC, cyanine-2, Cyanine-3, Cyanine-3.5, Cyanine-5, Cyanine-7, fluorescein, Texas red, rhodamine, lissamine and phycoerythrin.
  [0092]  Examples of fluorophores are provided in Table 6.

  [0093]  In order to aid in the purification of an amplicon, the primers or amplicons may additionally be incorporated on a bead. The beads used in the methods of the present invention may either be magnetic beads or beads coated with streptavidin.
  [0094]  The extension of the hybridized primer to produce an extension product is included herein by the term amplification. Amplification generally occurs in cycles of denaturation followed by primer hybridization and extension. The present invention encompasses form about one cycle to about 120 cycles, preferably from about two to about 70 cycles, more preferably from about five to about 40 cycles, including 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cycles, and even more preferably, 35 cycles such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120 cycles.
  [0095]  In order for the primers used in the methods of the present invention to anneal to a nucleic acid molecule containing the gene of interest, a suitable annealing temperature must be determined. Determination of an annealing temperature is based primarily on the genetic make-up of the primer, i.e. the number of A, T, C and Gs, and the length of the primer. Annealing temperatures contemplated by the methods of the present invention are from about 40° C. to about 80° C., preferably from about 50° C. to about 70° C., and more preferably about 65° C. such as 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 or 80° C.
  [0096]  The PCR amplifications performed in the methods of the present invention include the use of MgCl2 in the optimization of the PCR amplification conditions. The present invention encompasses MgCl2 concentrations for about 0.1 to about 10 mM, preferably from 0.5 to about 5 mM, and even more preferably 2.5 mM such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5 or 10 mM.
  [0097]  Polymorphisms of the present invention may be detected due to the presence of a base mis-match in the heteroduplexes formed following PCR amplification. A base mis-match occurs when two nucleotide sequences are aligned with substantial complementarity but at least one base aligns to a base which would result in an “abnormal” binding pair. An abnormal binding pair occurs when thymine (T) were to bind to a base other than adenine (A), if A were to bind to a base other than T, if guanine (G) were to bind to a base other than cytosine (C) or if C was to bind to a base other than G.
  [0098]  In order to detect the presence of alleles from the genes from Table 2 or combination of two or more genes in Table 3 predisposing an individual to an inability to overcome a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold form thereof or a risk of developing same, a biological sample such as blood is obtained and analyzed for the presence or absence of a panel of susceptibility alleles comprising from about one to 15 alleles of the genetic loci identified as being statistically significantly associated with the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state of interest. Results of these tests and interpretive information are returned to the health care provider for communication to the tested individual. Such diagnoses may be performed by diagnostic laboratories, or, alternatively, diagnostic kits are manufactured and sold to health care providers or to private individuals for self-diagnosis. Suitable diagnostic techniques include those described herein as well as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,492; 5,800,998 and 5,891,628.
  [0099]  According to the present invention, a method is also provided for supplying wild-type genes as listed in Tables 2 or 3 to a cell which carries a mutant or polymorphism. Supplying such a function should allow normal functioning of the recipient cells. The wild-type gene or a part of the gene may be introduced into the cell in a vector such that the gene remains extrachromosomal, in such a situation, the gene will be expressed by the cell from the extrachromosomal location. More preferred is the situation where the wild-type gene or a part thereof is introduced into the mutant cell in such a way that it recombines with the endogenous mutant gene present in the cell. Such recombination requires a double recombination event which results in the correction of the gene mutation. Vectors for introduction of genes both for recombination and for extrachromosomal maintenance are known in the art, and any suitable vector may be used. Methods for introducing DNA into cells such as electroporation, calcium phosphate co-precipitation and viral transduction are known in the art, and the choice of method is within the competence of the practitioner. Conventional methods are employed, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,492; 5,800,998 and 5,891,628.
  [0100]  The identification of the association between a gene polymorphism/mutation and a psychological phenotype or sub-threshold psychological phenotype permits the early presymptomatic screening of individuals to identify those at risk for developing a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state such as schizophrenia or to identify the cause of such disorders or the risk that any individual will develop same. To identify such individuals, the alleles are screened as described herein or using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, one of the following methods: fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), direct DNA sequencing, PFGE analysis, Southern blot analysis, single stranded conformation analysis (SSCP), linkage analysis, RNase protection assay, allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO), dot blot analysis and PCR-SSCP analysis. Also useful is the recently developed technique of DNA microchip technology. Such techniques are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,492; 5,800,998 and 5,891,628, each incorporated herein by reference.
  [0101]  Genetic testing enables practitioners to identify or stratify individuals at risk for certain behavioral states including substance addition or an inability to overcome a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof after initial treatment. For particular at risk couples, embryos or fetuses may be tested after conception to determine the genetic likelihood of the offspring being pre-disposed to the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state. Certain behavioral or therapeutic protocols may then be introduced from birth or early childhood to reduce the risk of the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state developing. Presymptomatic diagnosis will enable better treatment of these disorders, including the use of existing medical therapies. Genetic testing will also enable practitioners to identify individuals having diagnosed disorders (or in an at risk group) which have polymorphism identified in the genetic loci. Genotyping of such individuals will be useful for (a) identifying neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof that will respond to drugs affecting gene product activity, (b) identifying a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or sub-threshold neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state that in an individual which respond well to specific medications or medication types with fewer adverse effects and (c) guide new drug discovery and testing.
  [0102]  Further, the present invention provides a method for screening drug candidates to identify molecules useful for treating neurological, psychiatric or psychological conditions, phenotypes or states involving the gene or its expression product. Drug screening is performed by comparing the activity of native genes and those described herein in the presence and absence of potential drugs. In particular, these drugs may have the affect of masking a polymorphism or mutation or may bind to a particular polymorphism or mutation enabling it to be used as a diagnostic agent. The terms “drug”, “agent”, “therapeutic molecule”, “prophylactic molecule”, “medicament”, “candidate molecule” or “active ingredient” may be used interchangeable in describing this aspect of the present invention.
  [0103]  The goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active polypeptides of interest or of small molecules with which they interact (e.g., agonists, antagonists, inhibitors) in order to fashion drugs which are, for example, more active or stable forms of the polypeptide, or which, e.g., enhance or interfere with the function of a polypeptide in vivo or which are specific for a targetable (e.g. a polymorphism) and hence is a useful diagnostic. Several approaches for use in rational drug design include analysis of three-dimensional structure, alanine scans, molecular modeling and use of anti-id antibodies. These techniques are well known to those skilled in the art, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,837,492; 5,800,998 and 5,891,628.
  [0104]  A substance identified as a modulator of polypeptide function may be peptide or non-peptide in nature. Non-peptide “small molecules” are often preferred for many in vivo pharmaceutical uses. Accordingly, a mimetic or mimic of the substance (particularly if a peptide) may be designed for pharmaceutical use.
  [0105]  The designing of mimetics to a known pharmaceutically active compound is a known approach to the development of pharmaceuticals based on a “lead” compound. This approach might be desirable where the active compound is difficult or expensive to synthesize or where it is unsuitable for a particular method of administration, e.g., pure peptides are unsuitable active agents for oral compositions as they tend to be quickly degraded by proteases in the alimentary canal, Mimetic design, synthesis and testing are generally used to avoid randomly screening large numbers of molecules for a target property.
  [0106]  Once the pharmacophore has been found, its structure is modelled according to its physical properties, e.g., stereochemistry, bonding, size and/or charge, using data from a range of sources, e.g., spectroscopic techniques, x-ray diffraction data and NMR. Computational analysis, similarity mapping (which models the charge and/or volume of a pharmacophore, rather than the bonding between atoms) and other techniques can be used in this modeling process. A template molecule is then selected, onto which chemical groups that mimic the pharmacophore can be grafted. The template molecule and the chemical groups grafted thereon can be conveniently selected so that the mimetic is easy to synthesize, is likely to be pharmacologically acceptable, and does not degrade in vivo, while retaining the biological activity of the lead compound. Alternatively, where the mimetic is peptide-based, further stability can be achieved by cyclizing the peptide, increasing its rigidity. The mimetic or mimetics found by this approach can then be screened to see whether they have the target property, or to what extent it is exhibited. Further optimization or modification can then be carried out to arrive at one or more final mimetics for in vivo or clinical testing.
  [0107]  Briefly, a method of screening for a substance which modulates activity of a polypeptide may include contacting one or more test substances with the polypeptide in a suitable reaction medium, testing the activity of the treated polypeptide and comparing that activity with the activity of the polypeptide in comparable reaction medium untreated with the test substance or substances. A difference in activity between the treated and untreated polypeptides is indicative of a modulating effect of the relevant test substance or substances.
  [0108]  Following identification of a substance which modulates or affects gene or gene product activity, the substance may be further investigated. Furthermore, it may be manufactured and/or used in preparation, i.e., a manufacture or formulation, or a composition such as a medicament, pharmaceutical composition or drug. These may be administered to individuals directly or via gene therapy.
  [0109]  The expression products of the genes in Table 2 or 3, antibodies, peptides and nucleic acids of the present invention can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions, which are prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. 1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. The composition may contain the active agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the active agent. These compositions may comprise, in addition to one of the active substances, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, carrier, buffer, stabilizer or other materials well known in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., intravenous, oral, intrathecal, epineural or parenteral.
  [0110]  The present invention provides information necessary for medical practitioners to select drugs for use in the treatment of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state or a sub-threshold form thereof. With the identification that polymorphisms within a panel of genes are associated with a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state including a sub-threshold form thereof, such as schizophrenia, antipsychotic medications, can be selected for the treatment of such conditions.
  [0111]  The present invention further contemplates a method of treating a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state in an individual the method comprising identifying from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in a gene selected from Table 2 or a panel of genes selected from two or more genes in Table 3 with the neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state and subjecting the individual to gene therapy to alter the gene or genetic sequence having a different polymorphism or to treat the defect caused by the polymorphism or to subject the individual to behavioral modification protocols to help ameliorate the symptoms.
  [0112]  Another aspect of the present invention provides a method a method for determining the likelihood of a subject responding favorably to a particular drug in the treatment of a neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state said method comprising obtaining or extracting a DNA sample from cells of said individual and screening for or otherwise detecting the presence of from about one to about 100 polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in Table 2 including their 5′ or 3′ terminal region, promoter, intron or exons which with a statistical significant association with a particular neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state wherein the presence of the polymorphism profile is indicative of the likelihood of the drug being effective.
  [0113]  Using the compositions of the present invention, gene therapy may be recommended when a particular polymorphism conferring, for example, a disease condition or a propensity for development of neurological, psychiatric or psychological condition, phenotype or state is identified in an embryo. Genetically modified stem cells may then be used to alter the genotype of the developing cells. Where an embryo has developed into a fetus or for post-natal subjects, localized gene therapy may still be accomplished. Alternatively, a compound may be identified which effectively masks a particular undesired polymorphic variant or which influences the expression of a more desired phenotype. For example, one polymorphic variant of a receptor may result in an instability of the mRNA transition product.
  [0114]  Accordingly, the present invention also provides genetic test kits which allow the rapid screening of a polymorphism or polymorphisms within a test sample or multiple test samples. The kits of the present invention comprise one or more sets of primers, as described herein, which are specific for the amplification of a genetic region of interest. In addition, the genetic testing kits of the present invention provide a PCR mix, comprising MgCl2. In a preferred aspect, the MgCl2 is provided at a concentration of 2.5 mM. Additionally, the genetic test kits of the present invention provide instructions for using the primers of the present invention to obtain the desired duplexes, as well as instructions as to the analysis of the duplexes using d-HPLC. The test kits may also contain instructions for use.
  [0115]  In essence, the identification of a panel of polymorphisms in one or more genes as listed in Table 2 or 3 (or a subset) allows a clinician to confirm behavioral characteristics or provide a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Again, reference to the panel in Table 2 or 3 includes all genes listed in Tables 2 and/or 3 or combination of two or more genes.
  [0116]  Therapeutic kits are also contemplated by the present invention. For example, the kit may comprise a diagnostic or polymorphism detection component and a selection of therapeutics, the choice of use of which is dependent on the outcome of the diagnostic assay.
  [0117]  The present invention is further described with reference to the following non-limiting Examples.
 Example 1
Selection of Patients
 [0118]  The clinical data pertaining to schizophrenia patients are comprehensive and allow for the appraisal of specific phenotypic groups based on symptoms, history or response to medication. Patients were being treated at the Fortitude Valley Community Mental Health Centre, the Royal Brisbane Mental Health Unit and the Park Psychiatric Hospital each in Brisbane, Australia. Inclusion criteria were being between 18 and 65 years of age and having a DSM IV diagnosis of schizophrenia. In this particular study potential participants were excluded if they had Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Dementia, Organic Brain Syndrome or Major Depressive Disorder with Delusions. The clinical test battery includes measures of symptom type and severity (e.g. Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) or Positive and Negative Symptoms Test (PANDT) or Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale Total (PANSST)), medication adverse effects (e.g. Barnes Akathisia Scale) and neuropsychological status (e.g. Reitan's Trail Making Test). All patients meet DSM IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed.) criteria for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The clinical diagnoses of the patients that are being used for the study are of high quality regarding the accuracy of specific disease diagnosis. Patients are psychiatrically assessed by at least three independent psychiatrists and all must confirm the same diagnosis for patients to be included. These patients must have had a “stable and severe” diagnosis and have previously been in inpatient care and have displayed symptoms for at least five years and be currently undergoing antipsychotic drug treatment. Patients must have no previous diagnosis of any other disorders such as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, depression etc. It is also necessary for inclusion into the patient database that there be no previous history of drug dependence.
  [0119]  A parallel comprehensive data set to that obtained from those with schizophrenia exists to enable a finely grained understanding of the alcohol dependence phenotypes. The battery includes alcohol dependence symptoms (e.g. the Alcohol Dependence Scale), affective state (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory, Spielbergers State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), craving (Borg scale) and neuropsychological status (e.g. Reitan's Trail Making Test).
  [0120]  A 10 mL blood sample was drawn from each subject for DNA extraction.
 Example 2
Genotyping
 [0121]  The schizophrenia patient database is screened for functional polymorphisms in genes that are involved in the dopamine pathway and associated receptor genes. Further work has been performed to comprehensively screen the remaining SNPs of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene, in addition further genes include catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), protein kinase B (AKT1), dopamine associated transporter (DAT), ankyrin repeat and protein kinase domain-containing protein 1 (ANKK1), gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor alpha 1 (GABRA1), glutamate receptor metabotropic 3 (GRM3), serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A), karyopherin alpha 3 (KPNA3), proline dehydrogenase 1 (PRODH), regulator of G-protein signalling 4 (RGS4), disrupted in schizophrenia (DISC1), and dysbindin (DTNBP1) will be targeted.
  [0122]  The selected SNPs have been processed using the schizophrenia (n=160) and control (n=250) samples that are available. Sample numbers are sufficient to detect alleles accounting for 1-5% of genetic variation with a power of between 74% and 99%.
 Example 3
Methods
 [0123]  SEQUENOM [Trade Mark] has protocols optimized for multiplexing the homogeneous MassEXTEND (hME) assay. The hME assay is a simple and robust method for the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The speed and accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) offers a solution for high-throughput genotyping. The hME assay is based on the annealing of an oligonucleotide primer (hME primer) adjacent to the SNP of interest. The addition of a DNA polymerase along with a mixture of terminator nucleotides allows extension of the hME primer through the polymorphic site and generates allele-specific extension products, each having a unique molecular mass. The resultant masses of the extension products are then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and a genotype is assigned in real time. Performing multiple PCR and hME reactions in a single well (multiplexing) is a way to further increase the throughput and reduce cost per genotype. SEQUENOM has optimized individual reagent concentrations and thermal cycling conditions to multiplex PCR and hME reactions for best MALDI-TOF-MS-based genotyping results.
  [0124]  A list of primers used is shown in Table 7.

 Example 4
Procedure Used to Identify Panel of SNPs Associated with Schizophrenia
 [0125]  In two stages, a total of 172 SNPs were analyzed for association with schizophrenia. This followed identification of genes and a total of 273 SNPs that had been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia from the literature. These SNPs were then genotyped as described in Example 3. Some SNPs failed to amplify, some were monomorphic in our populations, while a small number, upon scrutiny, gave results that were inconsistent with expectation. These SNPs were removed from further analysis.
  [0126]  The remaining SNPs were analysed for association using Chi Square tests as described. However, it was expected that some SNPs found to be associated with schizophrenia would also be associated with each other. That is, once the genotype of one SNP was known, a knowledge of the genotype of a second SNP would not significantly add to the ability to diagnose schizophrenia, even though the second SNP was also associated with schizophrenia.
  [0127]  Thus, the intention was to identify the smallest set of SNPs that would give the greatest discriminating ability between control and schizophrenic individuals. To achieve this, two different methods were used: Binary Logistic Regression and Discriminant Function Analysis. Both methods build a model in which SNPs are sequentially added based on the extent and significance of association with schizophrenia. The most associated SNP is added first, than the most associated SNP independent of the first added SNP, then the most associated SNP independent of the first two added SNPs, and so on. No more SNPs are added to the list once the addition of new SNPs does not significantly improve the discriminating ability of the model.
  [0128]  One problem with the use of these methods is that missing data render calculations impossible. Obviously, when investigating 410 individuals for 172 SNPs there were many instances of missing data. To overcome the problem of missing data the method of “imputation of missing values” was used (Donders et al, J Clin Epidemiol 59(10):1087-1091, 2006; Burd et al, J Trauma 60(4):792-801, 2006; van der Heijden et al, J Clin Epidemiol 59(10):1102-1109, 2006). Specifically, for each SNP, the distribution of genotype frequencies was calculated for controls and schizophrenics. These frequencies were then used to generate a total of 260 “virtual” genotypes with identical genotype-frequency distributions to the original control and schizophrenic populations. Then for each missing genotype a virtual genotype was imputed to the data set that was randomly selected from the 260 virtual genotypes of the relevant SNP and schizophrenia/control designation.
  [0129]  Once the imputations had been done binary logistic regression and discriminant function analysis could be performed and a panel of SNPs generated that best predicted the schizophrenia/control status of individuals. To avoid any stochastic biases due to the imputation method, the process was repeated 10 times and the final panel of SNPs was selected on the basis of consistency of inclusion in the 10 generated models for each of the binary logistic regression and discriminant function analysis methods.
  [0130]  Table 2 lists the genes of interest and or a combination of SNPs listed in Table 3 lists the panel so far selected to best test for schizophrenia.
 Example 5
Linkage Disequilibrium Analysis
 [0131]  Linkage disequilibrium (LD) describes a situation in which some combinations of alleles or genetic markers occur more or less frequently in a population than would be expected from a random formation of haplotypes. LD is an important factor to examining association for disease susceptibility loci. This data describes the SNPs that are associated with schizophrenia that display LD. The identification of SNPs displaying LD explains the inclusion/exclusion of individual SNPs that are included in the discriminant analysis and logistic regression models.
  [0132]  The JLIN software package was used to generate LD values (Carter et al, BMC Bioinformatics 7(1):60, 2006).
  [0133]  Results of linkage disequilibrium analysis are shown in Table 8.

 Example 6
SNP Correlations with Clinical and Phenotypic Schizophrenia Patient Data
 [0134]  These data describe the correlation between the number of each allele in a particular individual and the phenotype of interest.
  [0000]  [1] Early Detection—Reported Age of Onset of schizophrenia and Family History Onset Age and Family History
 [2] Assessment of Clinical Features of Schizophrenia Symptoms and Markers of Severity
 [0135]  Suicide attempts, negative symptoms and number of admissions
 [3] Assessment of Comorbidity and Health Problems (Mental and Physical)
 [0136]  Number of cigarettes/day, grams/hour alcohol, mg/day cigarettes, pulmonary function, gambling history, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Trail Making Test A (TMTA) and Trail Making Test B (TMTB), impulsivity, General Health Questionnaire 1 (GHQ1), GHQ2, GHQ3, GHQ4 and GHQ Total (GHQT).
 [4] Medication Response (Adverse Medication Effects)
 [0137]  Glucose, prolactin (IU/I), and type of antipsychotic drugs (Risperidone, Olanzapine, Clozapine, Seroquel and Typical).
  [0138]  The following SNPs were found to be significant
 [1] Early Detection—Reported Age of Onset of Schizophrenia and Family History
 [0139]  Rs6277 (DRD2) with onset age (p=0.013). The CC (0.037 Tukey and 0.041 Bonferroni) and CT (0.013 Tukey and 0.014 Bonferroni) genotypes were associated with late onset age. An ANOVA was performed on the following data, comparing the mean of phenotypic data with genotype.
  [0140]  Rs4263535 (GABRA1) with onset age (p=0.046). Genotype GG has later onset age compared to AA (not significant p=0.181 Tukey). An ANOVA was performed on the following data, comparing the mean of phenotypic data with genotype.
  [0141]  Rs9562919 (KPNA3) with family history (p=0.013). A Pearson chi-squared test was performed.
  [0142]  Rs40184 (DAT) with family history (p=0.009). A Pearson chi-squared test was performed.
 [2] Assessment of Clinical Features of Schizophrenia Symptoms and Markers of Severity

 Example 9
Clinical Associations with the C957T DRD2 Polymorphism
Rs 6277
 [0189]  The following associations were identified.
 Clinical History
 [0190]  The CT and CC genotypes are associated with older onset age (p=0.023).
 Comorbidities
 [0191]  The T allele is associated with higher levels of grams of alcohol use per hour (p=0.014).
 Adverse Effects
 [0192]  (i) The T allele is associated with a higher AIMS total score (abnormal involuntary movement scale, total score out of 40) [p=0.010].
  [0193]  (ii) The T allele is associated with poorer attention score (PANSS Rating Scale—General Scale GII: poor attention) [p=0.001].
 Clinical Response
 [0194]  (i) The C allele is associated with higher CPZE/kg (Chlorpromazine equivalent in mg/kg body weight for primary antipsychotic drug) scores (p=0.041).
  [0195]  (ii) The T allele is associated with more significant Negative Symptoms score (PANSS Rating Scale-negative scale-Likert scoring system) [p=0.012].
  [0196]  (iii) The C allele is associated with higher CPZE (Chlorpromazine equivalent in mg for primary antipsychotic drug) scores (p=0.018).
 Example 10
Adverse Drug Reaction Effects with the C957T DRD2 Polymorphism
Rs 6277
Olazapine
 [0197]  (i) When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Olazapine, the C allele was associated with a higher Barnes total score (Barnes Akathisia Scale Total Score out of 14) [p=0.015], indicating greater motor restlessness causing distress.
  [0198]  (ii) When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Olazapine, the T allele was associated with a higher poor attention score (PANSS Rating Scale-General Scale GII: poor attention) [p=0.014].
  [0199]  (iii) When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Olazapine, the T allele was associated with a higher TMTB score (Trail Making Test (Part B) time in seconds) [p=0.017], indicating poorer global cognitive functioning, particularly cognitive flexibility.
 Clozapine
 [0200]  (i) When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Clozapine, the T allele was associated with poorer attention score (PANSS Rating Scale-General Scale GII: poor attention) [p=0.037].
  [0201]  (ii) When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Clozapine,
  [0202]  the T allele was associated with a higher Barnes total score (Barnes Akathisia Scale Total Score out of 14) [p=0.002], indicating greater motor restlessness causing distress.
 Example 11
Clinical Associations with the Taq 1A Polymorphism
Rs 1800497
Adverse Effects
 [0203]  (i) The TT or A1A1 genotype is associated with a higher Barnes total score (Barnes Akathisia Scale Total Score out of 14) [p=0.040], indicating greater motor restlessness causing distress.
  [0204]  (ii) The TT or A1A1 genotype is associated with increased levels of the hormone prolactin (mcgs/L) [p=0.027].
  [0205]  (iii) The T or A1 allele is associated with a higher TMTA (Trail Making Test [Part A] time in seconds) score (p=0.008), indicating poorer global cognitive functioning.
 Clinical Response
 [0206]  (i) The TT or A1A1 genotype is associated with increased CPZE (Chlorpromazine equivalent in mg for primary antipsychotic drug) levels (p=0.012).
  [0207]  (ii) The TT or A1A1 genotype is associated with increased CPZE/kg (Chlorpromazine equivalent in mg/kg body weight for primary antipsychotic drug) levels (p=0.004).
  [0208]  (iii) The TT or A1A1 genotype is associated with increased CPZE total/kg (Chlorpromazine equivalent in mg/kg body weight for total antipsychotic drug) levels (p=0.013).
 Clinical History
 [0209]  The T or A1 allele is associated with more hospital admissions (p=0.000).
 Example 12
Adverse Drug Reaction Effects with the Taq 1A Polymorphism
Rs 1800497
Clozapine
Adverse Effects
 [0210]  When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Clozapine, the T or A1 allele was associated with a higher TMTA (Trail Making Test [Part A] time in seconds) score (p=0.000), indicating poorer global cognitive functioning.
 Clinical Response
 [0211]  When patients were prescribed the antipsychotic drug Clozapine, the T or A1 allele was associated with more significant positive symptoms (PANSS Rating Scale-positive scale-Likert scoring system) score (p=0.015).

The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.      Cross-Reference To Relnte~Applications This application is a co,,~ ion-in-part of U.S. Application Serial No. 08/097,997, filed July 29, 1993, the disclosure of which application is entirely incorporated herein by rerelellce.      Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the Jak family of kinases and . 20  their role in the cellular response to the binding of cytokines to their ~,speclive receptors. The invention relates more specifically to the cytokine-in~lllce~l activation of at least one member of a Jak kinase family, to the i-lentifir~tiQn of interactions between specific cytokines and members of the Jak kinase family, and to compounds, compositions and methods relating to the regulation of this interaction.     wo ~5/03701 ~ o PcT/[rsg4/08676 D~s.".i,lion of fhe Bach~ d Art The growth, dirrelellliation and function of eukaryotic cells is regulated in large part by extracellular factors, referred to generally as cytokines herein.These cytokines induce cellular responses by bhldillg to their l~,s~ecliv~l~ceptol~. The receptors for cytokines fall into two major families, the cytokine l~ce~lol ~u~lr~mily and the tyrosine kinase receptor ~upt:lr~lllily.Rece~tol~ belonging to the tyrosine kinase receptor superfamily are characterized by the presence of an iclentifi~ble cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain involved in the tr~n~ ction of the cytokine-receptor binding signal.Members of this receptor family have been further c~ ifie~1 into three structural subgroups (Yarden et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 57: 443-478 (1988).Members of the first subgroup are characterized as monomeric with two cysteine rich sequence repeat regions within their extracellular domains and include, e.g., the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF-~(see, e.g., Ullrich et al., Nature 309: 418-425 (1984)). Members of the second subgroup are characterized as functioning as hel~lo~ lers and include the receptors for insulin (Ullrich, supra, (1985); Ebina et al., Cell 40:747-758 (1985)) and insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-1) (Ullrich et al., EMBO J. 5:2503-2512 (1986)). Members of the third subgroup are çl~ et~ d by- the presence of conserved repeat structures and the h~ ion of their catalytic d-)m~in~ by long (77-107 amino acids) insertion sequences. This third subgroup includes, e.g., lec~~ for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-R) (Yarden et al., Nature 323: 226-232 (1986)) and the colony stim~ tin~ growth factor (CSF-1) (Sherr et al., Cell 41: 665-676 (1985)).Rece~ol~ belonging to the cytokine receptor superfamily are char~-~teri7~(l by the p.~sellce of four positionally conserved cysteines and a WSXWS (SEQ ID No. 1) motif in the extracellular domain. The family is also c~ ~ed by variably sized cytoplasmic domains that show very limited sequence similarity and which do not contain iclentifi~hle motifs that ~95/03701 21 ~ ~ ~ 9 ~ PCT/US94/08676 might intli~te the signal transducing mechA.,i~ . Members of the cytokine rcceplor superfamily include the hematopoietic growth factor receptors, receptors for growth hormone, the prolactin lccc~lol, ciliary llcuroll~hic factor and others (Bazan, Science 257:410-413 (1992)). The lcc~tol~ for hllclrclull, although more distantly related, have been spec~llat~l to have evolved from a progenitor common to this leceptor ~u~,.r~ullily.In spite of the lack of catalytic domains, con~i(lerahle evidence suggests that signal tran~dllction of members of the cytokine lcccpl()r ~ùpelr~l~ily involves Iylo~ e phosphorylation (Miyajima etal., Annu. Rev. Immunol.10:295-331 (1992); Metcalf, Nature 339:27-30 (1989)). There is also some evidence that members of this receptor superfamily may utilize common tyrosine phosphorylation pa~w~ys for signal tr~n~ ction Specifically, binding of hematopoietic growth factors to their lcs~ecLi~e receptors have been found to induce comparable patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation (Ihle, in Interleukins: Molecular Biology and Immunology, Ki~himnto, ed., Karger, Basel, pp. 65-106 (1992)).While it is widely a~ cciaLcd that cytokine lecCp~ from both famili~s described above play a key role in cellular growth regulation, little is known about the bioch~-mir~l c~ec~les triggered by the binding of cytokines to these receptors. An underst~n~iing of the steps involved in the tran~-lnctionof the cytokine signal through these receptors would be useful for idelllifyillgmolecules which play a critical role in signal tr~n~ ction and which can serve as targets for reglllating the activity of these cytokines.A model for the study of ccel)tor signal tran~llrtion has been developed for the e.y~llopoietin lccel,lor (EPOR), one of the hematopoietic growth factor receptors and a member of the cytokine receptor ~uy~lra-llily.Introduction of the EPOR into interleukin-3 (IL-3) dependent cell lines confers on the cells the ability to proliferate in response to EPO (D'Andrea et al., Cell 57:277-285 (1989); Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)). In transfected cells, EPO induces the e,~ression of a series of imm.orli~te early genes inrl~ ing c-myc, c-fos, c-pim-1 and egr-l (Miura et al., Mol. Cell.     wo 95/03701 ~ 9Q~ PCT/U594/08676 Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993)). In addition, EPO induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a series of cellular substrates (T inn~kin et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 89:6237-6241 (1992); Dusanter-Fourt et al., J. Biol. Chem.267:10670-10675 (1992); Quelle and Wojchowski, J. Biol. Chem. 266:609-614 (1991); Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991); Yoshilllul~and Lodish, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992); Damen et al., Blood 80: 1923-1932 (1992)), suggesting that EPOR may function by coupling ligand binding to the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase.Although the importance of protein tyrosine phosphorylation for biological activities associated with EPO-EPOR binding has been clearly ~emc ~ ted, very little has been known conct;llling the kinases that might be involved. The rapid in~ ction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the carboxyl region of EPOR (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991);Yf ~ and T o~ h, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992); Dusanter-Fourt et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10670-10675 (1992)) suggests that the receptor is closely associated with a kinase, either coll~Li~uli~rely or following ligand binding. One study (Yoc~i-,-."d and T~rli~h, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992)) i(lentified a non-glycosylated protein of 130 kDa that could be cross-linked with the receptor and which was tyrosine phosphorylated either in vivo or in in vitro kinase assays as ~sesse~l by its ability to be detect~d by an anti-phospholylosine antibody. Whether the 130 kDa protein was a kinase could not be dele",-i~-Pd. Recent studies (~,inn~kin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 89:6237-6241 (1992)) also ide~tifiPd a 97 kDa substrate of tyrosine phosphorylation which could be radiolabeled with an azido derivative of ATP, suggesting that it was a kinase. Whether the 130 kDa or 97 Kda potential kinases are previously characterized kinases was not determinPd.Tyrosine phosphorylation has also been observed in response to the       ,.cytokine hll~r~ioll gamma (IE~Ny). Recent studies (Shuai et al., Science 2~9: 1808-1812 (1992)) have demo~ ed that IFN~y induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a 91 kDa protein, and that this 91 kDa protein migrates to the nucleus and binds a y-activated site.     ~95/03701 ~ d ~ 8 PCTIUS94/08676 Tyrosine phosphorylation has further been associated with the response to the cytokine growth hormone (GH). Studies in 3T3-F442A cells showing rapid GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of multiple proteills, tyrosyl phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein kin~.ces, and stim~ tion of microtubule-associated protein kinase activity, as well as the inhibition of these actions by inhibitors of growth hormone receptor (GHR)-associated tyrosine kinase (Campbell etal., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993)), suggest a central role for a GHR-associated tyrosine kinase activity in si~n~ling by GH. In addition, the pl~sence of a tyrosine kinase activity in a complex with GH receptor (GHR) pf~aled from GH-treated fibroblasts has been reported (Carter-Su. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264: 18654-18661 (1989);Stred et al., Endocrinol. 130: 1626-1636 (1992); Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem.267: 17390-17396 (1992)). More recently, a l~nlc;ce~lor tyrosyl phosphorylated 122 kd protein was identified in a kinase-active GH-GHRpreparation (Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:3573-3579 (1993)).To identify the spectrum of protein tyrosine kinases that are expressed in IL-3-dependent cells which might be involved in signal tr~n~dl~tion~polymerase chain reactions (PCR) have been done with degenerative oligonucleotides to conserved protein tyrosine kinase domains (Wilks, Methods Enzymol. 200:533-546 (1991)). Using this approach and Northern blot analysis, IL-3 dependent cells have been shown to express the genes for a number of protein lylu~hle kinases including Iyn, Tec, c-fes, Jakl and Jak2 (Mano et al., Oncogene 8:417-424 (1993)). Whether these tyrosine kinases, or other as yet ~mi-lentifi~d tyrosine kinases, are involved in cytokine signal tr~n~dllction is largely unknown.The potential involvement of Iyn kinase in signal tr~n~d~rtion was in~ te~l by a recent studies that inrli- ~ted that IL-3 stim~ tion increased Iynkinase activity in i,.""",.~ precipi~les (Torigoe etal., Blood 80:617-624 (1992))-Two of ~e other tyrosine kinases e,~ essed in IL-3-dependent cells, Jakl and Jak2, belong to the Jak family of kinases. The Jak (Janus kinase;                            J ~wo 95/03701 ~.6~ -6- PcTtuss4/08676 ~l~e. .~ vely referred to as iust _nother kinase) family of kinases were initially det~cted in PCR amplif1r~til n of tyrosine kinase dom~in~ in hematopoietic cells (Wilks, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1603-1607 (1989)). These studies identified two closely related genes (FD17 and FD22; later termed Jak2 and Jak1) from which the major PCR amplification products were derived. The complete structure of the human Jakl gene has been reported (Wilks et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991)) and, recently, a partial sequenre of the murine Jak2 gene was published (Harpur et al., Oncogene 7: 1347-1353 (1992)). Independently a third member of the family (Tyk2) was isolated by screening a cDNA library with a tyrosine kinase domain probe from the c-.fins gene (Firmhacl -Kraft et al., Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990)).The family is chara~;le,~ed by the presence of two kinase domains, one of which is a carboxyl domain that has all the h~llm~rk~ of protein kinases. The second dom~in is immr~ tely amino terminal and bears all the h~llm~rk~ of a protein kinase but differs ~ignifir~ntly from both the protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Amino ~e"~ l to the kinase domains, there are no SH2 and SH3 domains that char~rteri7r most of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases. However, there is extensive similarity in this region among the Jak family members and a l,u",bcl of homology dom~in~ have been defined (Harpur et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992)).A link belwèen one member of the Jak family of kinases and the signal tran~d~rtion of h~ r~,lvl~ alpha (I~Na) has been recently reported (Vel~7ql)e7 et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992); Fu, Cell 70:323-335 (1992); Srl-in~ller et al., Science 257:809-813 (1992)). Using a genetic approach, the l~k2 gene was cloned by its ability to functionally recol~liluk; the cellular response to IFN(x in a mutant human cell line that was unresponsive to IFNc~. No other link belwt;en Tyk2, or any other member of the Jak kinase family, and the signal tr~n~ lction of any cytokine other than IFN~ has been reported.     Ciliary lleu~ o~hiC factor (CNTF), as its name implies, is a protein that is specifically required for the survival of C~ .yOl~iC chick ciliary ganglion 11~U1~ S in vitro (Manthorpe et al., J. ~I 95/03701        Z 1 6 ~ 0 9 8      PCTIUS94/08676 Neurochem. 34:69-75 (1980)). CNTF has been cloned and ~y~ si~d in eukaryotic as well as bacterial G~lession systems, as described in T~ AI ;I nal Application No. PCT/US90/05241, filed SeptGlllbGl 14, 1990 by Sendtner et al., hICO1~JO1dtGd by leÇG~.lce in its enlircLy herein.Over the past decade, a number of biological effects have been ascribed to CNTF in addition to its ability to support the survival of ciliary ganglion neulolls. CNTF is believed to induce the dirÇGrG"Iidlion of bipotential glial progenitor cells in the pGlil~l rat optic nerve and brain (T-TnghPs et al., Nature 335:70-73 (1988)). Furthermore, it has been observed to promote the survival of embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons (Skaper and Varon, B~in Res. 389:3946 (1986)).Several novel activities of CNTF have also been discovered, including its ability to ~u~o,L the survival and dirr~.el,liation of motor 11GU10nS and hippoc~mp~l llGUl~JllS, and to increase the rate of hippocampal astrocyte proliferation (InlGlnalional Application No. PCT/US 90/05241, supra).     The CNTF r~c~tor (CNTFR or CNTFRa) has been cloned and expressed in eukaryotic cells, as described in T"l~."~ional Application No.PCT/US91/03896, filed June 3, 1991, incorporated herein by lGf~lGllce in its GllLil~ly .The seq~lenre of CNTFR reveals that, unlike most receptors which contain an extracellular dom~in, a hydrophobic Ll~ l"r~"hrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain, CNTFR does not appear to have a cytoplasmic dom~in Additionally, the tr~n~m~ hrane hydrophobic tlom~in is proteolytically Lr~cessed, with the mature form of CNTFR becolllil~g anchored to the cell surface by an unconventional linkage, referred to as a glycopht)sph~ti~iyl inositol (GPI) linkage (Id.). GPI-linked proteins such as CNTFR may be released from the cell surface through cleavage of the GPI anchor by the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Of other known ol sequences, CNTFR is related to a number of lcceptol~, rGr~ ,d to herein as the CNTF/IL-6/LIF rGCG~LOr farnily, including IL-6, LIF, G-CSFand onrost~tin M (OSM) (Bazan, Neuron 7: 197-208 (1991); Rose and Bruce, Wo 95/0370l ~9QD PCT/US9J/08676 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88:8641-8645, (1991)), but appears to be most closely related to the sequence of the ,eceplor for IL-6. However, IL-6 has not been shown to be a GPI-lirLked protein (e.g., Taga et al., Cell 51:573-581 (1989);Hibi et al., Cell 63: 1149-1157 (1989)) .The cloning, seq~len~ ing and e,~ c~ion of the CNTF lcceptor (CNTFR) led to the discovery that CNTFR and CNTF may for a complex that with a membrane bound, signal tr~n~d~cing collll)olle-lL, thus suggesting IL~ l~yculic activity of a soluble CNTF/CNTFR lecc~lor complex.One such signal transducing component involved in high affinity binding of CNTF and the subseqllent functional response of the cell has been i~lentifi~d as gpl30, a ,B component cornmon to the IL-6, OSM, LIF family of receptors (Fllhln~ et al., EMBO J. 10:2855-2865 (1991); Gearing et al., EMBO J. 10:2839-2848 (1991); ~e~ring et al., Science 255: 1434-1437 (1992); Ip et al., Cell 69:1121-1132 (1991)). A further ~ component identified as being involved in binding and signal tran.~ lcti-~n in response toLIF (LIFR,B) appears to be the same or similar to a ,~ component n~cess~ry for response to CNTF. (As a consequence of the identif r~tion of ~Bco~ o~ ntoces~. y for binding and signal tr~n~ lction of CNTF, what was ~rigin~lly generally terrned CNTFR is ;ulle-llly referred to as CNTFR~).IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine which acts on a wide variety of cells, exerting growth promotion and inhibition and specific gene expression SO~ S accol"~ qd by cellular dirÇelcll~ialion; it has been implicated as being involved in several ~ e~es including infl~mm~tiQn, ~uloi~ P-s and lymphoid m~ n~n~ies (Ki~himnto etal., Science 258:593 (1992)). LIF, G-CSF and OSM are all broadly acting factors that, despite having unique growth-regulating activities, share several common actions with IL-6 during hemopoiesis as well as in other processes. For example, all can inhibit the proliferation and induce the dirÇ~llliation of the murine myeloid lel~kemi~cell line, M1 (Rose and Bruce, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 88:8641-8645 (1991)).LIF and OSM in(1llced tyrosine phosphorylations and gene activation in ~1 95/03701 21 6 8 0 ~ ~ PCT/U594/08676 n~;urol~l cells which are intli.~tin uishable from responses in~lure~l by CNTF(Ip et al., Cell 69: 1121-1132 (1992)).Although the events ~u.rounding CNTF binding and ,eceplor activation have recently been elucidated (Davis et al., Science 253:59-63 (1991); Ip et al., Cell 69: 1121-1132 (1992); Stahl et al., Cell 74:587-590 (1993); Davis et al., Science 260: 1805-1018 (1993)), the mPchAni~i... by which signal tr~n~dllcti-)n is i~ ed inside the cell is more poorly understood. Like the other di~ Lly related receptors for the extended cytokine family--which includes Interleukin (IL)-3, IL-S, GM-CSF, G-CSF, EPO, GH, and the inL~lrelolls ((Bazan, J.F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6934-6938 (1990);Bazan, J.F., Neuron 7: 197-208 (1991))--the CNTF lec~or ,B subunits gpl30 and LIFR~ do not have protein tyrosine kinase dom~in~ in their cytoplasmic regions (Hibi et al., Cell 63:1149-115 (1990); Gearing et al., EMBO J.10:2839-2848 (1991)). In spite of this, CNTF-in~iuce~l dimerization of the ~Bs-lb~-nit.~ somehow result in the rapid ~rc~m~ tion of a set of tyrosine phosphorylated plotei~ls called the CLIPs (Ip et al., CeU 69:1121-1132 (1992))-Although, as described above, two of the more prominPnt CLlPs were identified as the ~B subunits th~n-celves, most of the others have yet to be charactPri~l The activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase(s) a~eal~ to be çssçnti~l for CNTF action since inhibitors that block the tyrosine phosphorylations also block subsequent dowl sll~ events such as gene inrillctiC)nc (Ip et al., Cell 69: 1121-1132 (1992)).A possible clue to the identity of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase(s) a~:liv~led by the CNTF family of factors came from the finding that other di~nlly related cytokines resulted in the activation of the Jak/Tyk family of kinases (Firrnh~rll-Kraft et al., Oncogene S: 1329-1336 (1990); Wilks et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991); Harpur et al., Oncogene 7: 1347-1353 (1992)). This family of no~ ,ceplol cytoplasmic protein ly~osille kinases consists of 3 known members--Jakl, Jak2, and Tyk2--which are all equally related to each other and share the l-n--su~l feature of having two potential wo 95/03701 ~6 PCT/US94/08676 kinase dom~in~ and no Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. Elegant studies involving compl~ ion of a genetic defect in a cell line unresponsive to IFNa resulted in the i~lentifir~tion of Tyk2 as a required component of the IFN~ sign~ling c~c~1e ((Vel~cq~le7: et al., CeU 70:313-322 (1992)). More S          l~,cenlly, the lcce~lo,~ for cytokines such as EPO, GM-CSF, and GH were shown to associate with and activate Jak2 (Argetsinger et al., CeU 74:237-244 (1993); Silvcm~illcll et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1993, in press);Witthuhn et al., CeU 74:227-236 (1993)). The kinase was shown to bind to the membrane proximal cytoplasmic region of the receplul, and mutations of this region that prevented Jak2 binding also resulted in the loss of EPOin-luced proliferation, s~lgg~ that Jak2 plays a critical role in EPO~i~n~lin~. Jakl has not been reported to be ~i~"ilir~.,lly a~;livaled by any of these receptor systems.The identi~lr~ti~ n of hemopoietic factors that share receptor colllpollc~ with CNTF would enable the utilization of CNTF and its specific ,cce~tol components for activation of targeted cells that are normally lC~OllSiVC to such hemopoietic factors.Citation of any document herein is not intended as an a~lmi~cinn that such ~loc~m~nt is pcl~ clll prior art, or considered material to the patentability of any claim of the present application.

Detailed Description of the Invenfion The present invention is in part directed to novel methods for regulating the cellular response to cytokines. These methods are based upon the general role of a Jak family of kinases in the cellular response to cytokines.By "cytokine" is meant any polypeptide secreted by cells that affects the function, such as survival, mitosis, dirr~.l nlialion or metabolism, of other cells. Examples of cytokines include, but are not limited to~ peptide hormones and growth factors.-                    By "cellular response to a cytokine" or "cytokine activity" is meant the general biological effect upon a eukaryotic cell or cell population which 1tim~tely results from the association of a particular cytokine with its cellular ,~ce~lol and typically involves the mo~lific~tion of gene e~1ession ~0 gS/03701 21 B8~ PCT/US94l08676 within the cell. The invention relates to cytokine activity which is me~i~t~by the activation of a Jak kinase. Examples of such activity include, but are not limited to, the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic p,ogeni~ol cells in r.,s~ollse to interleukin-3 (IL-3), the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid lineage cells in response to erythropoietin (EPO), somatic cell growth in response to growth hormone (GH), and other similar l~,~onses as known in the art, and/or as taught herein.The methods taught by the invention apply to any cytokine whose activity is mP~i~t~d by a member of the Jak kinase family, which includes, but is not limited to, Jakl, Jak2, Jak3 and Tyk2. Cytokines of this type include those which function by binding to members of the cytokine recep~or superfamily, and also those which function by binding to"members of the tyrosine kinase ,ecep~or superfamily. More specifically, these cytokines include, but are not limited to, at least one selected from the group con~i~tin~ of interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin 2 (IL-2), interleukin 4 (IL,4), interleukin 5 (IL-5), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 7 (IL-7), interleukin 9 (IL-9), interleukin 11 (IL-11), oncost~tin M (OSM), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte-macrophage specific colony stim~ ting factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon- y (IFN- y), prolactin hormone and growth hormone.According to the invention, Jak kinases mPrli~te cytokine activity through their tyrosine phosphorylation (i.e. activation) in response to cytokine-receptor binding. Thus, cytokines susceptible to the methods of regulation provided by the present invention may be identified on the basis of their ability to cause the tyrosine phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of one or more members of the Jak kinase family. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a Jak kinase in a cell following cytokine stim~ tion may be detected, for example, by assaying for its ability to bind antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody; only tyrosine phosphorylated Jak kinases will bind this type of r       ~WO 95/03701 ` ~ PCT/US94/08676 antibody. ~ ;vcly, in vitro kinase assays as described below may be used to dcl~lllline the state of activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) of a Jak kinase in a cell following cytokine stim~ tiQI~Jalc Kinase Peptides (J~P). A Jak kinase peptide (JKP), according S                         to the present invention, can refer to any subset of a Jak kinase (JK) having JK activity. A peptide fragment according to the present invention can be p,~aled by proteolytic digestion of the intact molecule or a fragment thereof, by ch~-mic~l peptide synthesis methods well-known in the art, by lcco~ DNA methods iiccll-csed in more detail below, and/or by any other method capable of producing a JKP and having a conformation similar to an active portion of JK and having Jak kinase activity, according to known Jak activity as scrccnillg assays, e.g., as described herein. The minimllm peptide sequence to have activity is based on the .cm~llest unit cont~ining or culll~fi~ g a particular region, co-~ce~ c sequence, or repe~ting unit thereof of a JK having Jak kinase activity, i.e., ability to be phosphorylated at least one tyrosine by at least one cytokine.Accol.li~lgly, a JE~P of the present invention ~ltern~tively includes polypeptides having a portion of a JK amino acid sequence which subst~nti~lly corresponds to at least one 15 to 400 amino acid fr~gm~ont and/or co--.~e.~ s seql~çnre of a known Jak kinase or group of JKs, wll~lc;i the JKP has homology of at least 80%, such as 80-99% homology, or any range or value therein, while m~int~ining Jak kinase biological activity, wheltill a JKP of the present invention is not naturally oc~;ullillg or is n~hlr~lly oc.;u~ g but is in a purified or isolated form which does not occur in nature. Preferably, a JKP of the present invention subst~nti~lly coll~ollds to a Jak kinase domain of particular Jak kinase, or group of Jak kin~ce~, as a co--cçn~c sequence, such as between Jakl and Jak2.Percent homology may be deterrnin~d, for example, by c~,lll~alillg sequence i,~llll~lion using the GAP co~ uLeL program, version 6.0, available from the Univel~i~y of Wisconsin Ge~tirs Computer Group (UWGCG). The GAP program utilizes the alignmPnt method of Needleman ~95/03701                              1 GSG~?3    PCT/US94/08676 and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), as revised by Smith and W~e..,.~l- (Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981). Briefly, the GAP program de~mes similarity as the nurnber of aligned symbols (i.e., nucleotides or amino acids) which are similar, divided by the total number of symbols in S       the shorter of the two sequences. The prt;r~ d default ~ Lel~ for the GAP program include: (1) a unary co~ o-- matrix (cont~inin~ a value of 1 for identiti~s and 0 for non-i~lentitie~) and the weighted colllpa~ison matrix of Gribskov and Burgess, Nucl. Acids Res. 14:6745 (1986), as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds., ATLAS OF PR017~INSEQUENCE AA~ STRUCTURE, National Biomr-lir~l Research Folln~l~tion~pp. 353-358 (1979); (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap; and (3) no penalty for end gaps.In a ~ ,r~lled embo~limrnt, the peptide of the present invention co,l~sponds to an active portion of a sequence of Figure 6.A peptide of at least about 5-335 amino acids (or any range or value therein) that has the basic structure of the active portion of a JK can, in one embo-limrnt be characterized as having 80-99% homology (or any range or value therein) to the above JK seq~lenre, which peptide can have JKactivity and is contrmrlated within the scope of the present invention.Thus, one of orlh~uy skill in the art, given the te~r.hing~ and gllill~nre c;se.lled in the present specification, will know how to ~b~iLll~e other amino acid residues in other positions of a JK to obtain a JKP, including Sl~ l deletional or insertional ~dli~lL~.A JKP of the present invention also includes a variant wLæ~ at least one amino acid residue in the polypeptide has been col~s~lv~tively replaced, inserted or deleted by at least one dirr~rt:nt amino acid.An amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of a JKP of the present invention is said to ''~ub~ ly correspond" to another amino acid or nucleic acid seql~rnre l~,i,pe-;Livt:ly, if the sequence of amino acids or nucleic acid in both molecules provides polypeptides having biological activity that is ~ub~li..                                li~lly sirnilar, qualitatively or ~    lively, to the Wo ~5/03701 ~,~"6~09 -22- PCT/US94/08676 co,l~*,o"dil~g fr~gmPnt of at least one JK domain having JK activity. Such "subst~ntiz~lly COll~S~G~iillg" JKP sequences include collselv~Live amino acid or nucleotide substitutions, or dege~ nucleotide codon substitutions wl~ individual amino acid or nucleotide s~b~ ions are well known in the art.Accoldillgly, JKPs of the present invention, or nucleic acid encoding therefor, include a finite set of ~-b~ ;Ally colles~ol~ding sequPnres as substitution peptides or polynucleotides which can be routinely obtained by one of ordinary skill in the art, without undue e~el;.,-~--l;1li~ n,based on the tP~rhing~ and glirl~nre ~l~sellL~d herein.

The types of substitutions which can be made in the protein or peptide molecule of the present invention can be based on analysis of the frequencies of amino acid changes between a homologous protein of dirre,~lll species, such as those p.~sel.ted in Table 1-2 of Schulz et al., infra. Based on such an analysis, ~ ."~iv~     Wo 95/03701 ~                                  PCT/US94/08676 collse,~,ali~re ~ub~ilu~ions are defined herein as e~ ges within one of the following five groups: 1. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues: Ala, Ser, Thr (Pro, Gly);2. Polar, ~ ly charged residues and their amides: Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln; 
3. Polar, positively charged residues:  His, Arg, Lys; 
4. Large aliphatic, nonpolar residues:  Met, Leu, Ile, Val (Cys); and 5. Large aromatic residues: Phe, Tyr, Trp. The three amino acid residues in parentheses above have special roles in protein arcllitoctl-re. Gly is the only residue lacking any side chain and thus imparts flexibility to the chain. This however tends to promote the formation of secondary structure other than ~x-helical. Pro, because of its S         lm~ l geometry, tightly Col~Llah~s the chain. It generally tends to promote ~B-turn-like structures, although in some cases Cys can be capable of partici~aLhlg in ~ lllfi~l~ bond formation which is important in protein folding. Note that Schul~ et al. would merge Groups 1 and 2, above.Note also that Tyr, because of its hydrogen bonding potential, has signifir~nt kinship with Ser, and Thr, etc.Consc, ~ e amino acid substitutions, included in the term "subst~nti~lly colles~ulldil,g'' or "corresponding", according to the present invention, e.g., as presellled above, are well known in the art and would be ekpecl~d to m~int~in biological and sLIu~;lul~l plopcllies of the polypeptide after amino acid substitution. Most deletions and insertions, and sllhstitlltinns accor~illg to the present invention are those which do not produce radical changes in the characteristics of the protein or peptide molecule. "(~h~r~cteristics" is defined in a non-inclusive lll~lncl to define both challges in secondary structure, e.g. ~-helix or ~B-sheet, as well as c~ es in physiological activity, e.g. in receptor binding assays.However, when the exact effect of the substitution, deletion, or insertion is to be confirm~d, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the effect of the s~bstitlltion or substitutions will be evaluated by routine JK     ~95/03701                            216^8~      PCTlUS94/08676 activity screening assays, either immunl ~s~ys or bioassays, to co.lrll,n biological activity, such as, but not limited to, Jak kinase.Amino acid seq~lPnre insertions as included in JKP variant can also include amino and/or carboxyl-le..~ l fusions of from one residue to polypeptides of ess~ lly un~ Llicled length, as well as intr~ceqllpn~e insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Intracequ~P~re insertions can range generally from about 1 to 10 residues, more preferably 1 to 5. An example of a ~e""il~l insertion includes a fusion of a signal seql~en~e, wheLller heterologous or homologous to the host cell, to a JKP to facilitate secretion from recombinant bacterial hosts.One additional group of valia~s according to the present invention is those in which at least one amino acid residue in the peptide molecule, and preferably, only one, has been removed and a dirfel~llL residue inserted in its place.For a det~ilP~l description of protein rhPmi~try and structure, see Schulz et al., Principles of Protein Structure, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1978; Ausubel, infra, which are hereby incorporated by lc:felcnce.Most deletions and insertions, and substitutions of JKPs according to the present invention are those which m~int~in or ill~rove the Jak kinase characteristics of the peptide molecule. However, when it is tliffi~l~lt to predict the exact effect of the sub~lilulion, deletion, or insertion in advance of doing so, one skilled in the art will a~lccialc that the effect will be evaluated by routine scrce,...lg assays. Por example, a variant made by site-specific mutagenesis of the peptide molecule-encoding nucleic acid and e*)l~,ssion of the variant JKP in cell culture or, alLe~ livcly, by çh.qmi~synthesis, can be tested for Jak kinase activity (e.g., as is known or as desclibed herein). The activity of the cell Iysate or purified peptide variant can be sclc~ ed in a suitable sclce.~.-lg assay for the desired characteristic, for example Jak kinase activity in any of the several assays.Morlifi~tiQns of peptide plo~cllies, such as redox or th~rrn~l stability, hydrophobicity, susceptibility to proteolytic degradation or the Wo 95/03701 ~ -26- PCT/US94/1\8676 tçntlrnry to aggregate with carriers or into mllltimrrs, can also be assayed by mrthofls well known to the o,di1~ily skilled artisan.Also included in the scope of the invention are salts of the JKPs of the invention. As used herein, the term "salts" refers to both salts of carboxyl groups and to acid addition salts of amino groups of the protein or peptide molecule.Amino acid seql~Pnre va1iâr1~ of a JKP of the present invention can also be prG~a1Gd by mutations in the DNA. Such variants include, for example, deletions from, or insertions or substitutions of, residues within the amino acid sequence. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can also be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct posse~çs some Jak kinase activity. Preferably improved Jak kinase activity is found over that of the non-variant peptide.Obviously, mutations that will be made in the DNA encoding the variant must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complemrnt~ry regions that could produce secondary mRNAstructure (see, e.g., EP Patent Application Publication No. 75,444;Ausubel, infra; Sambrook, infra).At the genetic level, these variants or~illa1ily are prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of nucleotides in the DNA encoding a JKP, thereby producing DNA encoding the variant, and thereafter expressing the DNA in recombinant cell culture. The variants typically exhibit the same qll~lit~tive biological activity as the naturally oc~ g JK (see, e.g., Ausubel, infra; Sambrook, infra).Knowledge of the three-~limrn~ional structures of proLGil~s is crucial in underst~n~1ing how they function. The three-di.~ ion~l structures of more than 400 P1~Gi11S are ~;u11G11Lly available in the protein structure l~t~ha~e (in contrast to around 200,000 known protein and peptide seqllPnres in sequence (l~t~b~es~ e.g., Genh~nk, Chrmir~l Abstracts REGISTRY, etc.). Analysis of these structures shows that they fall into recognizable classes or motifs. It is possible to model the tbree-~ .lr"~ional structure of protein based on homology to a related protein of known structure. Examples are known where two protei,ls that have relatively low seq~lenre homology, but are found to have almost r            identir~l three dimellsional structure. Such homologous v~uiall~. are also included in JKPs of the present invention.Once a Jak kinase structure or çh~racteristics have been ~el~ lin~d using the above analysis, IKPs can be recoml)il~lllly or synth~til ~lly produced, or optionally puri~led, to provide coll~ne-cially useful amounts of JKPs for use in ~ gnostir or rcsea~ applications, according to known method steps (see, e.g., Ausubel, infra, and Sambrook, infra, which L~,Ç~lcnces are herein entirely incorporated by reference) Methods for ~nhibifitlg C~ytokine Activity Dependent Upon lak Ki~n~es According to the invention, the activity of a cytokine may be inhibited by inhibiting the activity of the Jak kinase which me~ trs that cytokine's effect upon the cell.One way of inhibiting Jak kinase activity within the scope of the present invention is by inhibiting Jak gene e~lcssion. Expression of Jak kinases may be inhibited using antisense molecules or ribozymes.ç.~e molecules and their use for inl~iling gene ~le;,sion are well known in the art (see, for example, Cohen, J., Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRCPress (1989); Toole, WO 92/10590). ~nti~e~e molecules useful for hlhibilillg the e~rcssion of a Jak kinase contain nucleic acid seqnenres complement~ry to, and capable of binding to, the mRNA and/or DNA gene seq lenre of the Jak kinase desired to be inhibited. Such ~ ice~e molecules may be provided to the cell via genetic ~ cs~ion using DNAencoding the ~nti~eI~e molecule as taught by U.S. Patent No. 5,190,931, issued March 2, 1993 to Inoue, M. (incorporated by lcçele.lce herein in its e~ cly). ~ ively, ~ e molecules of the invention may be made WO gS/03701             ~   - ~    PCTIUS94/08676 synth~Ptir~lly and then provided to the cell. Synthetic ~nti~ense molecules co~ ...plated by the invention includè oligonucleotide de.ivaliv~s known in the art which have improved biological activity co---l,a.ed to mm()tlifiPrl oligonucleotides (see, e.g., Cohen, J., supra; U.S. Patent No. 5,023,243, S         issued June 11, 1991 to Tullis, R.H. and incorporated by lef~,lellce herein in its e.-lirely).Ribozymes and their use for inhibiting gene e~plession are also well known in the art (see, e.g., Cech et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 17479-17482 (1992); Hampel et al., Biochemistry 28: 49294933 (1989); Haseloff et al., Nature 334: 585-591 (1988); Eckstein et al., WO 92/07065; and U.S.Patent No. 5,168,053 issued to Altman et al. and incorporated by ltrerellce herein in its elllil~ly). Like a--lisense molecules, ribozymes contain target sequences complementary to the mRNA of the genes whose expression they are ~1esignP~l to inhibit. Ribozymes useful for inhibiting the ~ression of a Jak kinase may be ~lPsignPd by incorporating target sequences into the basic ribozyme structure which are complementary to the mRNA seq~uPnre of the Jak kinase desired to be inhibited. Ribo~y..les ~.gelil.g a Jak kinase may be ~y~ si~Pd using commercially available reagents (Applied Bio~y~lt;...s) or they may be genPtir~lly ~ lessed from DNA encoding them.As will be l~,co~ d by the skilled artisan, anlisellse and ribozyme molecules may be deci~nPd to inhibit a specific member of the Jak kinase family by ~lgelillg seq~lPnres unique to that member. Allt;ll~li~/ely, e~-~e and ribozyme molecules may be decignPd to inhibit more than one Jak kinase by Largeling sequences shared by the Jak members desired to be inhibited.Jak kinase activity may also be inhibited through the use of compounds or peptides which inhibit the ability of the Jak protein to function as a kinase. Such inhibitors include, but are not limited to, drugs, anti-Jak kinase antibody, Jak kinase agonists and antagonists, trans-dc,l-lil.;..    l~ of Jak kinase, and general inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity such as GENESTEIN. These inhibitors may have a general 21 6809~95/03701 ~ r ~ PCT/US94108676 inllibilul~ effect upon all Jak kinases or they may possess a more specific inl~i~ol y effect upon a specific member or subset of the Jak kinase family.Ihe term "antibody", as used herein, refers both to monoclonal antibodies which are a subst~nti~lly homogeneous population and to polyclonal antibodies which are heterogeneous populations. Such antibodies may be of any imml~nr)globulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, IgD and any subclass thereof. The term "antibody", as used herein, is also meant to include both intact molecules as well as fr~gm~nt~ thereof, such as, for example, Fab and F(ab')2, which are capable of binding antigen. Fab and F(ab')2 fr~gm~nt~ lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation, and may have less non-specific tissue binding than an intact antibody (Wahl et al., J. Nucl. Med.24:316-325 (1983)). Such fr~gmPnt~ are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Pab fr~gment~) or pepsin (to produce F(ab')2 fr~gTn~nt~). See, generally, Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256:495497 (1975); U.S. Patent No. 4,376,110; Ausubel et al, eds., CURRENT PROTOCOLS INMOLECULAR BIOLOGY, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., (1987, 1992, 1993, 1994); and Harlow and Lane ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORYMANUALCold Spring Harbor Laboratory (1988); Colligan et al., eds., Current Protocols in Im~nunology, Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley T..l~ C;f .~ e, N.Y., (1992, 1993), the co"l~"l~ of which ,efel~ nces are entirely inco,~ur~L~d herein by ,~fert;llce. Such antibodies may be of any immlln-~globulin class including IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA, GILD and any s~lbrl~s thereof.Both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to Jak kinase may be made accoldmg to m~tho~lc well known in the art (see, e.g., Harlow, supra; Colligan, supra; Ausubel, supra, at 11.4.2-11.13.4). Antibodies may be gelu.~led against Jak kinase protein produced recombinantly or isolated from cells and tissues where the Jak kinase naturally occurs.Antibodies may be gene,~led against the entire Jak kinase protein or, more Wo 95/03701 ? ~ -30- PCT/[1594l08676 preferably, antibodies are ~ ed against peptide subfr~gm~nt~se~ functional domains of the Jak kinase protein required for its cytokine-intluced tyrosine kinase activity. Antibodies for specifically i"hil,iLmg a particular Jak kinase may be gene~aled against peptide         ~-fr~gmPnt~ unique to that Jak kinase. ~lLr. "~ively, antibodies for generally inhibiting more than one member of the Jak kinase family may be gel~ldted against peptide fragments shared by the Jak kinases desired to be inhibited.Another method for inhibiting Jak kinase activity taught by the invention is through the use of inhibitors of the cytokine-dependent activation of the Jak kinase. Prior to cytokine stimnl~tion, cellular Jak kinase is present in an inactivated state. Inhibitors of Jak kinase activation may be identified by their ability to inhibit the conversion of the Jak kinase into its catalytically active state, which can be ~l~t~ct~-d by in vitro kinase assay as described below and in the Examples.As discuvelc;d by the present i,lv~ " Jak kinases are activated by their cytokine-in-luce~l tyrosine phosphorylation. Accordingly, inhibitors may also be identified according to the invention as those compounds or peptides which block or si~nifir~ntly reduce the cytokine-inrlnced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jak kinase into its catalytically active form. The state of tyrosine phosphorylation of a Jak kinase following cytokine stimnl~tinn may be assayed, for example, by the ability of the Jak kinase to be rlet~cte~l with an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody.Activation of a Jak kinase by a particular cytokine may require the physical association of the Jak kinase with the l~;c~Lor for that cytokine (see Example 2). According to the invention, peptide antagonists mimirl~ing those portions of the Jak kinase or cytokine receptor involved in this association are useful as inhibitors of Jak kinase activation. These peptides are co,l~ lated by the invention to act as inhibitors by associating with either the cytokine receptor (for the Jak kinase peptides) or ~95/03701 ~1 6~098 PCT/USs4/08676 the Jak kinase (for the cytokine ,ece~ol peptides), thus blocking the ~oci~tion of the Jak kinase with the cytokine lcc~lor.In particular, the invention teaches that Jak2 activation by EPOl~uilcs the physical association of Jak2 with the EPO ~ceL)l~r (EPOR) and that this ~soci~tion requires a l"en~rdl,e proximal region of EPORthat is es~ l for mitogenesis. According to the invention, peptide antagonists mimi~ in~ this ...~,..h~ proximal region and capable of blocking the EPOR-Jak2 interaction are useful as inhibitors of Jak2 activation by EPO.             Assays for Inhibitors of Jak kinase activity The present invention also provides sclce~ing assays for ide,~iryil~g inhibitors of Jak kinase activity useful in the methods described herein above.Jak tyrosine kinase activity can be assayed in vitro by combining catalytically active Jak kinase, a Jak phosphorylation ~ul~ dte(s), and ATP    with the phosphorous at the ~y position ~letloct~hly labelled with, for example, a radiolabel such as 32p. In this assay, the Jak kinase catalyzes the L~ srel of the labelled phosphorous from ATP to the substrate and Jak kinase activity is ~let~cted by the generation of substrate cont~inin~~letloct~bly labelled pho,sphorous (i.e. labelled sul,sL~ate). Inhibitors of Jakkinase activity are identified as those colll~ullds or peptides which, when incorporated into the assay, signifir~ntly reduce or eli",in~le the gen~ldtion of labelled substrate.Catalytically active Jak kinase for use in this assay may be obtained from a variety of sources. Preferably, a catalytically active Jak kinase is ob~d",ed from insect cells transforrned with a baculovirus vector capable of e~,tssi~g the Jak kinase at high levels. Jak2 kinase produced in this way has been found to be catalytically active and useful in in vitro kinase Wo 95/03701 ~,~6~ -32- PCT/US94/08676 assays. It is expected that other Jak kinases produced in large amonnt~ in insect cells in a similar llla,~el will also be catalytically active.A catalytically active Jak kinase may also be obtained from cells C~lyi~g mutations which result in col~,LiLuLi~e activation of the Jak kinase.For example, an EPOR mutation known as Rl99 to C results in c~ e activation of the EPOR (Yosl.i-~ .a et al., Nature 348:647-649 (1990)). In cells e"~l~;,sillg this mllt~tio~ in the absence of EPO, Jak2 kinase is co~ ulively tyrosine phosphorylated and possesses in vitro kinase activity.Catalytically active forms of each Jak kinase may also be obtained from cells stimlll~t~l with a cytokine which causes their activation. For example, catalytically active Jak2 kinase may be obtained from cells stim~ ted with EPO, growth hormone, IL-3, and other cytokines, while catalytically active Tyk2 may be obtained from cells stim--l~t~(l with IFNa.Any phosphorylation ~7u1~.7LIdL~ of the Jak kinase whose activity is being de~ llilled may be used in the assay. For a Jak kinase which possesses autophosphorylation activity, a ~rerelled substrate is the Jak kinase itself, or a subfragment thereof cont~ining the autophosphorylation site. Tyrosine kinases such as the Jak kinases generally tend to possess autophosphorylation activity (see, for example, Hanks, S.K. et al., Science 241: 42-52 (1988). Moreover, autophosphorylation activity for Jak2 has been established and the autophosphorylation site has been found to reside on a peptide fragment co..~ i..p amino acids 1000-1015 of Jak2 (see Figure 1; the sequence is VLPQDKEYYKVKEPG (SEQ ID No. 2)).Similar peptides fr~m~nt~ exist in the Jakl protein at amino acids 1015-1029 (see Figure 2; the sequence is AIETDKEYYTVKDDR (SEQ IDNO:3)) and in the Tyk2 protein at amino acids 1047-1061 (see Figure 3;-             the sequence is AVPEGHEYYRVREDG (SEQ ID NO:4)). Based on structural and functional ~imil~rities among the Jak kinases, as well as functional similarities among tyrosine kinases in general, it is expected that ~t95/03701 ~1 6~og8 PCT/USg4/08676 the other mPmbers of the Jak kinase family also possess autophosphorylation activity.The present invention also provides an assay for inhibitors of cytokine-in~ ed activation of a Jak kinase. Cytokine-in~ ced activation of S         a Jak kinase can be assayed by pl~paling Jak kinase e~tr~ctc from cells following cytokine in~llctinn and assaying the extracts for in vitro kinase activity as described herein. Inhibitors of cytokine-in~ ced activation of a Jak kinase are identi~ as those compounds or peptides which, when present in the cells before and/or during cytokine induction, cignific~ntly reduce or elimin~te the in vitro kinase activity detected in the Jak kinase extracts ~l~alcd from the cells following cytokine in~lllction.The present invention also provides an assay for inhibitors of Jak kinase-cytokine receptor interactions which are potential inhibitors of cytokine-in~ ced Jak kinase activation. For those cytokine receplo,~ which are phosphorylated by an activated Jak kinase, the Jak kinase-cytokine ,tceplo, interaction may be detected using the in vitro kinase assay described above by inco,~o,dli"g the cytokine receptor into the assay as the phosphorylation substrate. For example, phosphorylation of the e.yllllopoietin receptor (EPOR) by Jak2 kinase may be detect~-d using this assay. Inhibitors of the Jak kinase-cytokine receptor interactions are itlentif;ed as those compounds or peptides which, when incorporated into this assay, si~ ir~ 1y reduce or elimin~te the gell~,dlion of phosphorylated (labelled) cytokine receptor protein.Cytokine ,ec~lor protein is preferably obtained for use in this assay by production and purification from a recombinant host suitable for such purposes as described herein for the production of Jak kinases. Apreferable host is insect cells Lldnsrolllled with a baculovirus vector capable of e~r~sil,g cytokine lcc~plol at high levels. All~ lively, cytokine ,cceplor protein may be isolated from natural sources. 
6~ PCT/US94l08676 Methods for F.rlhn~cing Cytokine Activity Dependent Upon Jak hnases In those situations where the biological les~onse of a cell to a cytokine is deficient due to incllf~rient amounts of a Jak kinase, ~e present invention provides for enhancing this response by increasing the levels of the Jak kinase in the cell (see Example 4). This situation could be due to mutations which reduce the amount of the Jak kinase produced by the cell to sub-normal levels. This situation could also be due to mutations which reduce the rate or degree of cytokine-in~luce~l Jak activation such that the level of Jak kinase produced by the cell does not provide sufficient levels of activated Jak kinase following cytokine ind~lrtion.The levels of Jak kinase may be increased in a cell by adding Jak kinase protein to the cell, or by introducing a vector into the cell capable of eA~,~,s~ g the Jak kinase. Vectors and m~thotl~ for the eAl,res~ion of Jak2 are provided below. As will be readily ap~al~ to one of skill in the art, these methods may also be applied to the pro~ rtic)n and ~A~l~ssion of other members of the Jak kinase family. Therapeutic Applica~ions Of The Methods For Regula~ing Cytokine Activity It is also contemplated by the invention that m~tho(ls provided for reg~ tin~ Jak kinase activity as described above may be applied to lleatillg disease conditions caused by an abnormal cellular ,~pol~e to a cytokine whose activity is m~ tt-d by the activation of a Jak kinase. Thus disease conditions caused by an excessive cellular response to a cytokine whose activity is m~ ted by the activation of a Jak kinase may be treated by - 25         inhibiting Jak kinase activity. In particular, disease conditions caused by eAcessive proliferation of eukaryotic cells may be treated by inhibiting Jak kinase activity where this excessive proliferation occurs in response to a cytokine whose activity is m~ t~d by the activation of a Jak kinase. Such 95/03701 0~' PCT/US94/08676 disease conditions are caused by genrtir~lly acquired mutations or *~ollL~eously acquired mutations.For example, c~yLlllo~losis is a gen~tir~lly acquired disease that involves excess proliferation of erythrocytes from progenitor cells. The ~ cl~loduction is dependent upon eLyLl~oietin (EPO) and is caused by a mutation in the EPO l~CcpLOl (EPOR) that results in the abnormal regula~ion of Jak2 kinase activity through EPO-EPOR binding.      Comparable mutations may also occur spontaneously and give rise to this disease condition. In addition, analogous disease conditions may occur in other cell lineages that are regulated through a Jak kinase mrdi~tt-d cytokine response.All~ vcly, disease conditions caused by a deficient cellular response, or nom~esl,c,llsivelless, to a cytokine whose activity is mr~ t~d by the activation of a Jak kinase may be treated by enhalleillg Jak kinase activity.     It is colllclll~lated by the invention that ~ on of the compositions as described herein capable of inhibiting Jak kinase activity, incl~l~ing ~nti~rn~e molecules, libozylnes, Jak antibodies, antagonists, etc.may be acco"~lished by any of the mPthods known to the skilled artisan.For example, ~lh~ lalion may be by palcllL. lal, sub-;u~neous, iuLlavel~ous~ inLl,..,~ r, intra-pc,iLoneal, or transdermal routes, ~lmini~t~red in a ph~rm~t~e~ltir~lly acceptable carrier by any means ~,COglli~d as suitable by the skilled artisan.It is understood that the dosage of a ~h~....~relltiral compound or c~lllLJosilioll of the present invention ~lmini~tered in vivo or in vitro will be dependent upon the age, sex, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of con~;ullcll~ Llca~ r~-l if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the ~h~ ..r~lir~l effect desired.

Among ~..,....1l,~1~, the ~r~fell~d recipients are ...~     of the Orders Primata (including l-~ n.~, apes and monkeys), Arteriodactyla (including horses, goats, cows, sheep, pigs), Rodenta (including mice, rats, rabbits, and h~m~ters), and Carnivora (including cats, and dogs). Among birds, the ~,~fe.led recipients are turkeys, chi~n.e and other members of the same order. The most plc;rt:lled recipients are hllm~n~          Antibodies ~ Joble of Ri.~ g To Specific Jak Proteins Without Interfering With Kinase Activity The present invention also provides antibodies useful for ~l~tçctin~and extracting specific Jak kinases from eukaryotic cells without disrupting their kinase activity. These antibodies are ge~ aLed against a peptide fragment represçnting a portion of the Jak hinge region between dom~in~ 1 and 2 that is different for each Jak kinase. Peptides useful for gell~La~ g such antibodies are derived from amino acids 758-776 of Jak2 (Figure l;the sequence is DSQRKLQFYEDKHQLPAPK (SEQ ID NO:5)), amino acids 786-804 of Jakl (Figure 2; the seq~len~e is TT TFKF~T~FyEsRcRpvTps (SEQ ID NO:6)), and amino acids 819-837 of Tyk2 (Figure 3; the sequence is SP~;.K~H~QRQHRLPEPS (SEQ IDNO:7)). According to the invention antibodies genelated against these peptides can speciffcally bind to and recognize the Jak protein from which the peptide antigen was derived without illL~.re;lillg with kinase activity.Through the application of standard i"~ c;cipitation techniques, these antibodies can be used to obtain cell extracts cont~ining a specific Jak protein for use in the in vitro kinase assay. Such a use is demo~ dl~d for antibody gel1e.aled against the hinge region of Jak2 kinase in Examples 1-3 and 5.                wo gS/0370~ 9 PCT/US94/08676 Jak Genes and Proteins Accor~ g to the present invention, the cDNA sequences and col.c~ollding amino acid seqll~nres of Jak kinases are provided, such as Jak3 and murine Jak2 kinase. The nucleotide sequence of a full-length Jak2 cDNA is provided in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:8) and contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 3387 bp encoding the Jak2 protein, which is 1129 amino acids long and has a c~lc~ ted molecular weight of 130 kDa. The 5' end of the Jak2 cDNA in Figure 1 has three stop codons before the first ATG. Although the first ATG does not fulfill the Kozak collscll~us fl~nking seqnPnre~, it is immrt1i~tely followed by an ATG codon in the typical tr~n~l~ti~n initiation e,lvhul-lllent (Kozak, M., Nucl. Acids Res.15:8125-8148 (1987)). The S' end does not contain an obvious signal peptide. The compiled size of the 3' untran~l~tecl region of the Jak2 clones is 0.9 kb which corresponds to a 4.4 kb ~ sc~Jak3 cDNA was 3.8 kb and contained a long open reading frame encoding a protein with 1099 amino acids and a size of 122.6 kDa. The seq~lenre (Fig. 6) is highly related to other Jaks and was termed Jak3.Known method steps for ~y~ si~ g oligonucleotides probes useful for cloning and e~rcssing DNA encoding a Jak kinase of the present invention, based on the teaclli"g and g~ nre pl~scnl~d herein, are -                     disclosed by, e.g., Ausubel, infra; Sambrook, infra; and Wu et al., Prog.Nucl. Acid. Res. Molec. Biol. 21:101-141 (1978), which ,cfcle.lces are entirely inco,~ulaled herein by lcfe~ ce.A suitable oligonucleotide, or set of oligonucleotides, which is capable of encoding (or which is complementary to a sequence encoding) a Jak fragment is identified as above, synthesized, and hybridized by means well known in the art, against a DNA or, more preferably, a cDNA~lc~ lion derived from cells having Jak genes and/or which are capable of c~lcssillg a Jak kinase. Single str~nded oligonucleotide probes ~95/03701 ~16~o9~ ~ PCT/US94/08676 complen~Pnt~ry to a Jak activity encoding sequence can be synthPci7~d using method steps (see, e.g., Ausubel, infra; Sambrook, infra).Such a l~hel~(l, c~etect~ble probe can be used by known procedures for scl~,e.lillg a genomic or cDNA library as described above, or as a basis for ~y~ g PCR probes for amplifying a cDNA ge~ led from an isolated RNA encoding a Jak nucleic acid or amino acid seqllen~e. As a further non-limhing example, llall~rollllalll~ can be selecte~l for ~ ssion by a host cell of a Jak kinase by use of selection media aL,~r~liat~ to the vector used, RNA analysis or by the use of antibodies specific for a target protein as a Jak kinase used in a method accol~i lg to the present invention.A target, ~let~ct~hly labeled probe of this sort can be a fragment of an oligonucleotide that is complem~nt~ry to a polynucleotide encoding a Jak kinase. AlLelna~ively, a ~ylllh~lic oligonucleotide can be used as a Jak probe which is preferably at least about 10 nucleotides in length (such as 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, or more, or any combination or range therein, in increments of 1 nucleotide), in order to be specific for a target a nucleic acid to be detect~l amplified or e~lessed. The probe can co.l~olld to such lengths of a DNA or RNA encoding a Jak, such as a seq len~e corresponding to a portion of SEQ ID NO:l or a Jakl, Jak2, Jak3 or trkl seq~lenre p-est;llled Figure 6, whc.eh~ the probe sequence is selected acco.dhlg to the host cell cont~ining the DNA, e.g., as pl~ se..led in Table Al.4 of Ausubel, infra. Jak kinase encoding nucleic acids of the present invention can include 15-1500, such as 15-1009, 15-1006, 30-600, and 90-1500 nucleotides, or any range or value therein, subst~nti~lly compl~,,.P~ to a portion of a sequence presented in Figure 6, wl~e the codons can be substituted by codons encoding the same or co~selvalivt;ly substituted amino acids, as well known in the art.C~lltnring of the host and infl~lction of protein e~ssion can be in-lllce~ll by methods known per se. A nucleic acid sequence encoding a Jak kinase of the present invention can be recombined with vector DNA in WO 95/03701 ~,~6309 PCT/US94/08676 ,. ~ ~0-accordance with conventional techniques, including blunt-ended or staggered-ended termini for ligation, re~l . ;rlion enzyme digestion to provide a~ ",lial~ termini, filling in of cohesive ends as approplidLe, linr phosphatase ll~ to avoid undesirable joining, and ligation with a~plopli~L~ ligases. Known techniques for such manipulations are disclosed, e.g., by Ausubel, infra, and are well known in the art.A nucleic acid molecule, such as DNA, is said to be "capable of eA~lessillg" a polypeptide if it coll~ills nucleotide sequenres which contain Lldnscliylional and tran~l~tional regulatory il~llllation and such sequences are "operably linked" to nucleotide sequenres which encode the polypeptide. An operable linkage is a linkage in which the regulatory DNA sequences and the DNA sequence sought to be expressed are co--~ d in such a way as to permit gene expression of a Jak kinase or peptide having Jak activity in recoverable amounts. The precise nature of the regulatory regions needed for gene ~ ,s~ion can vary from organism to org~ni~m, as is well known in the analogous art. See, e.g., Sambrook, -              infra; Ausubel, infra.The process for ge~rtir~lly e~ , Jak2 kinase, according to the invention, is facilitated through the cloning of DNA encoding a Jak kinase and through the expression of such seql~e~r-es. DNA encoding a Jak kinase may be derived from a variety of sources according to the invention, including genomic DNA, cDNA, sylllllelic DNA, and combinations thereof.Genomic DNA may or may not include naturally oc~;ulling introns.Moreover, such genomic DNA may be obtained in association with the 5' promoter region of a Jak gene sequence. The 5' promoter region may be retained and employed for expression of a Jak in those host cells which recognize the eA~lession signals present in this promoter region.Genomic DNA or cDNA, which does not contain introns, may be obtained in several ways. Genomic DNA can be ~x~ and purified from suitable cells by means well known in the art. ~lt~ tively, ~95/03701                                                        6~098 PcTluss4lo8676 ~1-m~s~ el RNA (rnRNA) may be isolated from a cell which produces a Jak kinase and used to ~ dl`e cDNA by means well known in the art. Such suitable DNA ~r~palations are el~y~ ic~lly cleaved, or randomly sheared, -  and ligated into recombinant vectors to form either a genomic or cDNAS      se~ re library (see Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, published by Current Protocols,  5Ø3-5.10.2 (1987, 1992, 1993, 1994)). Such libraries can then be screened for hybri~ii7~tiQn with nucleic acid probes based upon a Jak gene sequence provided in Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:8) or Figure 6, in order to identify and isolate cloned Jak encoding sequences (see Ausubel, F. M. et al. supra,  6Ø3-6.6.1). The members of the library i~lçnti~led by this screen are then analyzed to delelll,h,e the extent and nature of the Jak sequences they contain.In lieu of the above-described recombinant methods, a gene sequence encoding Jak kinase can be pl~aled ~y~ r~lly according to m.otho~ well known in the art (see Ausubel, F. M. et al., supra, 2.11.1-2.11.18).The cloned Jak encoding sequences, obtained through the methods described above, may be operably linked to an e~ression vector and introduced into a b~ l or eukaryotic cell to produce a Jak kinase.Techniques for such manipnl~tionc are well known in the art and are close(l in Ausubel, F.M. et al., supra, at  3Ø3-3.16.11.A DNA is said to be "capable of ~lt;SSillg" a polypeptide if it co"L~",s nucleotide seq~enres which contain transcriptional and tr~n~l~tional regulatory information and such seq~lellres are "operably linked" to nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptide. An operable linkage is a linkage in which the regulatory DNA seql~en~-es and the DNAcoding sequence sought to be e,~ssed are col---P.;Ie~l in such a way as to permit expression of the coding sequence. The precise nature of the regulatory regions needed for gene expression may vary from olg~ni~ to or~~nicm, but shall generally include a promoter region which, in WO 95/03701 ?.,~ 9 PCT/US94/08676 prokaryotes, contains both the promoter (which directs the initiation of RNA Ll~nscliplion) as well as the DNA sequences which, when transcribed into RNA, will signal the initiation of translation of the coding sequence.Such regions will normally include those 5'-non-coding sequences involved with initiation of Ll~lscli~Lion and translation, such as the TATA box, c~L)pi~ sequence, CAAT seq~np-nre~ and the like.If desired, the non-coding region 3' to the gene sequence coding for the Jak2 kinase may be obtained by the above-described methods. This region may be retained for its regulatory seqllenre~, such as ll~nscli~Lional le~ "i"~tion and polyadenylation signals. Thus by ret~ining the 3'-region n~hlr~lly contiguous to the DNA sequence coding for a Jak kinase, these regulatory regions may be provided. Where the regulatory signals are not s~ti~f~ctorily filn~tion~l in the ek~ssion host cell, then a 3' region functional in the host cell may be substh~ltPd.To express a Jak kinase in a prokaryotic cell (such as, for example, E. coli, B. subtilis, Pseudomonas, Streptonryces, etc.), it is ~-kces~ly to operably link the Jak kinase encoding seq~lenre to a functional prokaryotic promoter. Such promoters may be either co"sliluli~re or, more preferably, regulatable (i.e., inducible or der~r~ssible). Examples of col~LiluLi-~e promoters include the int promoter of bacteriophage A, the bla promoter of the ~ e gene sequence of pBR322, and the CAT promoter of the chloramphenicol acetyl L,~.n~r~,rase gene sequerlre of pPR325, etc.Examples of inducible prokaryotic promoters include the major right and left promoters of bacteriophage )~ (PL and PR)~ the trp, recA, lacZ, lacI, and gal promoters of E. coli, the c~-amylase (Ulm~n~n, I., et al., J.Bacteriol. 162:176-182 (1985)) and the a-28-specific promoters of B.subtilis (Gilman, M.Z., et al., Gene sequence 324:11-20 (1984)), the promoters of the bacteriophages of Raeil/~/~ (Gryczan, T.J., In: The Molecular Biology of the Bacilli, ~ca~lemic Press, Inc., NY (1982)), and Streptor~ryces promoters (Ward, J.M., et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 203:468-478 (1986)). Prokaryotic promoters are reviewed by Glick, B.R., J. Ind.   ~3-Microbiol. 1:277-282 (1987); Cen~tiPmpo, Y., Biochimie 68:505-516 (1986); and GolLr~ , S., Ann. Rev. Genet. 18:415 442 (1984).Proper e,~r~ssion in a prokaryotic cell also requires the presence of a ribosome binding site up~Ll~ of the gene seq~lenre-encoding sequence.Such ribosome binding sites are disclosed, for example, by Gold, L., et al., Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 35:365-404 (1981).P~,r~.l.,d eukaryotic hosts include yeast, fungi, insect cells, Ill~llllll~li~n cells either in vivo, or in tissue culture. l~mm~ n cells which may be useful as hosts include, but are not limited to, COS cells and cells or cell lines derived from fibroblasts, myeloid lPnkPmi~, or normal hematopoietic tissues.For a Ill~ n host, several possible vector systems are available for the eA~.~ssion of the Jak kinase. A wide variety of Llansc.i~lional and tr~n~l~tional regulatory sequences may be employed, depending upon the nature of the host. The Ll~scli~lional and tr~n~l~tional regulatory signals may be derived from viral sources, such as adenovirus, bovine papilloma virus, Simian virus, or the like, where the regulatory signals are associated with a particular gene sequerlre which has a high level of e~r~ssion.,All~ l;v~ly~ promoters from l..~"l,ll~ n expression products, such as actin, collagen, myosin, etc., may be employed. T.a.ls~ ional initi~ti~n regulatory signals may be selectP~l which allow for r~.es~ion or activation, so that ~k~lcssion of the gene seq~P-nres can be mo~ te(l. Of interest are regulatory signals which are Le..~ aLule-sel~iLi~ so that by varying the l~in~ ll.e, expression can be ~,r~sed or initi~terl, or are subject to ch~-.lir~l (such as metabolite) regulation. See, e.g., Ausubel et al., infra, at  1.5, 1.10, 7.1, 7.3, 8.1, 9.6, 9.7, 13.4, 16.2, 16.6, and 16.8-16.11.Factors of i,ll~?olL~nce in selecting a particular plasmid or viral vector include: the ease with which recipient cells that contain the vector can be recognized and se!ectPd from those recipient cells which do not contain the vector; the number of copies of the vector which are desired in a particular WO 95/03701 ~ - PCT~US94/08676 ~6~ 44-host; and whether it is desirable to be able to "shuttle" the vector belwæhost cells of dirre~l species.A pl~;r~l~d host for production of catalytically active Jak kinases is insect cells, for example the Drosophila larvae. Using insect cells as hosts, the Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase promoter can be used (Rubin, G.M., Science 240:1453-1459 (1988)). ~ lively, baculovirus vectors can be .~gi.~Pel~d to express large amounts of Jak kinase in insects cells (see, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, published by Current Protocols,  16.8.1-16.11.7 (1987, 1993, 1994);Jasny, B.R., Science 238:1653 (1987); Miller, D.W., et al., in Genetic Engineering (1986), Setlow, J.K., et al., eds., Plenum, Vol. 8, pp. 277-297). Expression of Jak kinase in insect cells from baculovirus vectors produces activated Jak kinase which may be used in sclc;enillg assays for h~ibiLol~ of Jak kinase activity as described above.As ~ el-~se~l above, expression of the Jak kinase in eukaryotic hosts lc~luilcs the use of eukaryotic regulatory regions. Such regions will, in general, include a promoter region sufficient to direct the initiation of RNAsynthesis. ~lefell~d eukaryotic promoters include the promoter of the mouse metallothionein I gene sequence (Hamer, D., et al., J. Mol. Appl.Gen. 1:273-288 (1982)); the TK promoter of Herpes virus (McKnight S., Cell 31:355-365 (1982)); the SV40 early promoter ~enoist, C., et al., Nature ~Condon) 290:304-310 (1981)); the yeast gal4 gene sequence promoter (Johnston, S.A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 79:6971-6975 (1982); Silver, P.A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 81:5951-5955 (1984)); and the 9-27 gene promoter ~eid, L.E., et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 86:840-844 (1989); Ausubel, in~a; Lewin, Genes III, John Wiley & Sons, publishers, New York, N.Y.

For this reason, it is -~95/03701 ~8~ PCT/US94/08676 45- ; preferable to ensure that the linkage betweell a eukaryotic promoter and a DNA seql~Pnre which encodes the Jak kinase does not contain any illt~ e~ g codons which are capable of encoding a methionine (i.e., AUG). The presence of such codons results either in a formation of a fusion protein (if the AUG codon is in the same reading frame as the Jak kinase encoding DNA seqll~pnre) or a frame-shift mutation (if the AUGcodon is not in the same reading frame as the Jak kinase encoding sequence).The Jak kinase encoding sequence and an operably linked promoter may be introduced into a recipient prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell either as part of a non-replicating DNA (or RNA) molecule, which may either be a linear molecule or, more preferably, a closed covalent circular molecule.Since such molecules are incapable of autonomous replication, the ~lession of the Jak kinase may occur through the transient e~lession of the introduced seque~ce. ~ IAI;Ve1Y~ permAnP~t e~le~sion may occur through the intP~gr~tion of the introduced sequence into the host chromosome.In one embo~limPnt, a vector is employed which is capable of integldlhlg the desired gene sequences into the host cell chromosome.Cells which have stably hl~ t~d the introduced DNA into their chromos-)m~s can be selected by also introducing one or more ll~ s which allow for selection of host cells which contain the e~les~ion vector.The marker may provide for ~n)toLlopy to an auxotrophic host, biocide rP,eietAnre, e.g., antibiotics, or heavy metals, such as copper, or the like.The selectAble marker gene sequence can either be dil~;clly linked to the DNA gene sequences to be e~ s~ed, or introduced into the same cell by co-L.~r~;clion. Additional el.omPnte may also be needed for optimal ~yl~ esis of single chain binding protein mRNA. These elPmPnte may include splice eignAle, as well as Lld Isc-ipLion promoters, Pl~hAnre,s, and ~   -AIion signals. cDNA expression vectors illCOl~JUld~illg such elemPn WO 95/03701 ~,~.600~9 PCTIUS94/~8676 ~6-include those described by Okayama, H., Molec.

Any of a wide variety of vectors may be employed for this purpose. Factors of illlyu,~l~ce in selecting a particular pl~mi-l or viral vector include: the ease with which ~ ie"L cells that contain the vector may be recognized and selçct~d from those recipient cells which do not contain the vector; the number of copies of the vector which are desired in a particular host; and whether it is desirable to be able to "shuttle" the vector belweell host cells of dirrt ,~ species. Preferred prokaryotic vectors include plasmids such as those capable of replication in E. coli (such as, for example, pBR322, ColE1, pSC101, pACYC 184, ~TVX. Such plasmids are, for example, disclosed by Sambrook, infra).Racjl1rl~ plasmids include pC194, pC221, pT127, etc. Such plasmids are disclosed by Gryczan, T. (In: The Molecular Biology of the Bacilli, Ac~ mic Press, NY (1982), pp. 307-329). Suitable Streptomyces plasmids include pIJ101 (~t~:n~1~ll, K.J., et al., J. Bacteriol. 169:4177-4183 (1987)), and ~l,~t~",yces bacteriophages such as ~C31 (Chater, K.F., et al., In:Sixth International Symposium on Actinomycetales Biology, ~k~lemi~i Kaido, Budapest, Hullgaly (1986), pp. 45-54). Pseudomonas plasmids are reviewed by John, J.F., et al. (Rev. Infect. Dis. 8:693-704 (1986)), and Izaki, K. (Jpn. J. Bacteriol. 33:729-742 (1978)).Preferred eukaryotic plasmids include BPV, vaccinia, SV40, 2-micron circle, etc., or their dcliv~ives. Such plasmids are well known in ~e art (Botstein, D., et al., Miami Wntr.

Expression of the cloned gene seq~n~e(s) results in the production of the Jak kinase.Expressed Jak kinase may be isolated and purified as described herein, using convention~l mPthodc such as extraction, precipitation, cci~iL~lion, chromatography, affinity ch,~o".atography, electrophoresis, or the like.Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily un~ierstood through ,~rt;,~"lce to the following example which is provided by way of illustration, and is not intentl-o~l to be limiting of thepresent invention.                                Examples F.rnn~rle 1: Structure of the Murine Jak2 Protein lgrosine Kinase and Its Role ln II~3 Signal Trn~ chQn Summary Interleukin 3 (IL-3) regulates the proliferation and dirr~lcl~liation of a variety of hc~naLo~oietic cells inrlllding early pro~,el~ilul~ and cells cn~ d to various lineages. The l~,Cc~Lol for IL-3 consists of cY and ,l~s~b~nite that together are required for the expression of a high affinity l'cCcplO~. The IL-3 receptor chains are members of the cytokine lcceplo~    WO 95/03701 ~ PCT/US94108676 ?.~ 6~9 -48-family and contain cytoplasmic ~om~inc that lack itl~ntifi~hle kinase catalytic domains. However, IL-3 binding rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the ,B chain of the receptor as well as a number of cellular proleins. To investigate the potential role of the Jak family of S        protein tyrosine kinases in IL-3 signal tr~ncd~ction~ we have obtained full-length cDNA clones for murine Jakl and Jak2 and prepared antiserum against the predicted proteins. Using alllisel~. against Jak2 we demol~Lla~e that IL-3 stim~ tion results in the rapid and specific ~ylo~ille phosphorylation of Jak2 and activates its in vitro kinase activity. These results support the hypothesis that Jak2 couples IL-3 binding to tyrosine phosphorylation and llltim~tely to the biological responses mPdi~t~(l by IL-3.         In~roduction ~em~topoiesis is regulated through the interaction of a variety of growth factors with their cognate lcceptols (Metcalf, D., Nature 339:27-30 (1989); Clark and K~men, Science 236:1229-1237 (1987)). Among the known hematopoietic growth factors, interleukin-3 (IL-3) supports the proliferation and dirr~.cll~iation of early progenitors as well as cells that are cn..--..illPcl to several of the myeloid lineages (Ihle, J.N., in Interleukins:Molecular Biology and Irnrnunology, Kichimoto, T., ed., Karger, Basel, pp. 65-106 (1992)). The lcceptol for IL-3 has been shown to be composed of two subunits, an cY subunit of 60-70 kDa and a ~ subunit of 130-140 kDa which are required for high affinity binding of IL-3 (Miyajima, A., et al., Annu. Rev. Im~nunol. 10:295-331 (1992)). Both the c~ and ~Bsubunits contain the extracellular conserved motifs found in the cytokine ,~cepLor ~u~elr~llily. Similar to other m~mhers of this ~u~,l~lnily, the cytoplasmic domains of the lcceptor subunits share only a limited .cimil~rity with other cytokine l~ceplol~ and lack any l~t~ct~hle catalytic ~lom~inc that might suggest a signal transducing mech~ . In spite of the lack of catalytic dom~inc, considerable evidence suggests that signal trancdllction WO 95/03701 680~9~ PCT/US94/08676 involves tyrosine phosphorylation (Metcalf, D., Nature 339:27-30 (1989);Miyajima, A., et al., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 10:295-331 (1992)).S~ecirlcally, activated tyrosine kinases can abrogate the requirement for IL-3 and IL-3 rapidly induces the lylosille phosphorylation of several cellular snbstr~tes as well as the ~ subunit of the IL-3 lcceplor complex. For these reasons there has been considerable interest in idelllirying a protein lylu~illekinase that may associate with the l~,c~tor and be activated by ligand binding.To identify the spectrum of protein tyrosine kinases that are expressed in IL-3 dependent cells which might be involved in signal tr~n~d~ction, polymerase chain reactions (PCR) have been done with degenerative oligonucleotides to conserved protein tyrosine kinase domains (WiLks, A.F., Methods Enzymol. 200:533-546 (1991)). Using this approach and Northern blot analysis, IL-3 dependent cells have been shown (Mano, H., et al., Oncogene 8:417-424 (1993)) to express the genes for a number of protein tyrosine kinases including Iyn, Tec, c-fes, Jakl and Jak2.The potential involvement of lyn kinase in signal tranC~ rtion was intlir~trrl by a recent study that in~lir~te(l that IL-3 stimnl~tion increased lyn kinase activity in i"""l-"r pr~ci~ilaLes (Torigoe, T., et al., Blood ~0:617-624 (1992)). However, we have not lrtect~l an effect of IL-3 on lyn kinase activity or on the status of lyn lylosille phosphorylation in the murine IL-3 dependent cells we have e~minP~l. We have also not detected any Iylosille phosphorylation or activation of kinase activit,v of Tec or c-fes. Therefore our efforts focused on developing reagents to assess the role of murine Jakl and Jak2 genes in IL-3 signal tr~n~ rtion.The Jak (Janus kinase; alternatively referred to as iust another _inase) family of kinases was initially detected in PCR amplification of tyrosine kinase dom~in~ in hematopoietic cells (WiLks, A.F., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 86:1603-1607 (1989)). These studies i~lentified two closely related genes (FD17 and FD22; later termed Jak2 and Jakl) from which the major PCR amplification products were derived. The complete structure of WO 95/03701 ~,~ 5~9~ PCT/US94/08676 the human Jakl gene has been reported (Wilks, A.F., et al., Mol. Cell.Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991)) and, rcccully, a partial sequence of the murine Jak2 gene was published (Harpur, A.G., etal., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992)). Independently a third m~omher of the family (Tyk2) was isolated by SCl`ccl~ing a cDNA library with a lyrosine kinase domain probe from the c-ffns gene (Firmh~ch-Kraft, I., et al., Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990)).The family is ch~r~t~rized by the ~ltscllce of two kinase domains, one of which is a carboxyl domain that has all the h~llm~rk~ of protein kinases.The second domain is i~ ly amino te. .--il-~l and bears all the h~llm~rk~ of a protein kinase but differs ~ignifi~antly from both the protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Amino terminal to the kinase domains, there are no SH2 and SH3 llom~inc that char~qctçri~e most of the non-lcceptol tyrosine kinases. However, there is extensive similarity in this region among the Jak family members and a number of homology domains have been defined aIarpur, A.G., et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992))-A link belw~n one member of the Jak family of kinases in signal tran~d~lction has been established in recent studies e~ the cellular response to iu~elr~,luil alpha aFNcY) (Vela7que7, L., et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992)). Using a genetic approach, the l~k2 gene was cloned by its ability to functionally recol~liluLe the cellular response to IFN~ in a mutant human cell line that was unresponsive to IFNa. It has been spec llate~l that the kinase activity of Tyk2 is activated following IFNc~ bhldillg and is l~ ol~ible for the phosphorylation of the 113 and 91/84 kDa plol~ s of the h~ r~lol~-stimlll~t~cl gene factor 3 ~ aSGF~) complex (Fu, X.Y., Cell 70:323-335 (1992); Sçhin~1ler, C., et al., Science 257:809-813 (1992)).Following phosphorylation this complex ~oci~tes with the ISGF3 y protein and the complex mi~rates to the nucleus and activates gene ek~,~s~ion by binding to the h-lt;l~lull-stimlll~t~l ,e~o~lse element.A role for Jak2 in the response to clyllu~oietin (EPO) is ~lesc-rihecl in Example 2. The studies described demo.~ e~l that EPO stim~ tion ~95103701                           68AO~ PCT/US94/08676 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and activates its in vitro ~uLol-h-sl~horylation activity. Using a series of ..  l;..   l~ of EPOR, the in~ ction of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation was found to correlate with the induction of biological le~ollses. Jak2 was also shown to physically associate with the membrane proximal, cytoplasmic region of the EPO~ceplol that is required for biological activity.In the studies ~l~,se,lled here we disclose the complete structure of the murine Jak2 gene. We demc,ll~lla~e that Jak2 is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to IL-3 and there is an associated activation of its in vitro autophosphorylation activity. The results provide evidence that Jak2 is the protein tyrosine kinase that couples IL-3 stim~ tion to tyrosine phosphorylation and llltim~tely to the biological le~ollses. Moreover, the involvcl.lc,ll of Jak2 in the responses to both IL-3 and EPO shows that Jak2, or family members, are involved in the mitogenic ~ign~lling pathway of a variety of henlato~oietic growth factor receptors.           Ma~eri~ils and IU~tho~ J~lo~n of Murine Jak2 Clones. Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with de~sellelalive oligonucleotides corresponding to the conserved domain were used to amplify cDNAs from murine bone Ill~lO~V derived monocytes as previously described (WiLks, A.F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA 86:1603-1607 (1989)). The Jak2 cDNA clone was 32p labeled by r~n-lom priming and used to screen murine mol~o~;y~e and IL-3 dependent myeloid NFS~8 and DA3 cell phage cDNA libl~l;es (Yi and Willman, Oncogene 4:1081-1087 (1989); Morishita, K., et al., Cell 54:831-840 (1988); Bartholomew and Ihle, Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:1820-1828 (1991)).I'he isolated cDNA fr~gm~nt~ were cloned into pBluescript vector and analyzed by restriction l.-ap~i..g and sequen~ing. Subsequent phage library scl~el~ g~ were done with the most 5' Jak2 cDNA fragments. The longest cDNAs were subcloned into pBluescript vector and the nucleotide sequence wo 95/03701 2 ~ 6 ~ ~ 9 PCT/US94/08676 was ~lete"~ rcl by dideoxy chain terrnin~tion method (Sanger, F., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:5463-5467 (1977)) .Northern Analysis. Total cellular RNA and poly(A)+ RNA were isolated from mouse tissues and cell lines as previously described (Cleveland, J.L., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:5685-5695 (1989)).Approxim~tely 20 ~g of total RNA and 4 ,ug of poly(A)+ RNA were s~y~led on 1.0% agarose/form~l(le~lyde gels and lla~ r~,d to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized with 32p labeled randomly primed 800 bp cDNA fragment derived from the 5' of Jak2. After autoradiography the filters were stripped and probed with ~B-actin.Cells and Cell Culture. The properties of the cell lines used in these studies have been described (Ihle and Askew, Int. J. Cell.Cloning 1:1-30 (1989)). The cells were m~int~in.orl in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and murine IL-3 (25 U/ml) for IL3 dependent cells. Mouse bone lllallow derived monocytes were grown as previously described (Yi and Willman, Oncogene 4:1081-1087 (1989)).Computer Analysis. The DNA and protein l~t~h~es were searched with the Gçnrtirs Cc,~ u~ Group seq~lenre analysis software. The SWISSPROT and GENBANK l~t~h~es were searched with FASTA and TFASTA programs.Generation of Antibodies. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the N ~ ....i,)~l portion of Jak2 protein (amino acids 19-31) and to the hinge region belwee~ om~in~ 1 and 2 (amino acids 758-776 (SEQ ID NO:5)) were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by MES coupling and used for ;--~ ;on of rabbits. A ~yll~le~ic peptide to the analogous hinge region of Jakl (amino acids 786-804 (SEQ ID NO:6)) was similarly prepared and used for colll~ ion studies. Unless otherwise intlir~t~(l lefe~ lce to Jak2 antibody or anti-peptide antibody, and manipulations involving Jak2 antibody, refer to antibody generated against the hinge region (amino acids 758-776 (SEQ ID NO:5)).                                     53 9~ PCT/US94/08676 In vitro Tr~ 7~tic!n and Transcript~on. Full length Jakl or Jak2 cDNAs were inserted into pBSK (STRATAGENE) and used to make L~llS~ lS with T3 RNA polymerase according to the protocol provided.Appro~im~tely 3 ~g of RNA was used in translation reactions (Str~t ~gen~) in the presence of 35S tr~n~l~bel (NEN). The products were divided equally and either run on SDS-PAGE without manipulation or immlm~lc~ ed with Jakl or Jak2 antisera. Peptide co",~ io~c were plcfolllled by bi~li"g peptides (100 ~4g/ml) with alllisel~ for 1 h at 4 C prior to use in immllnoplc;ci~ ions.In Vitro Kinase Assays. T~ni,~ ol)leci~ ed proteills on Protein A-SEPHAROSE (PHARMACIA) were washed with kinase buffer (50 mMNaCl, 5 rnM MgCk, 5 mM MnCk, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM HEPES pH 
7.4) and subsequently were inrllbzlted for 30 min at room le~ clalulc with an equal volume of kinase buffer cont~ining 0.25 mCi/ml 32P-^y-ATP.After extensive washing, pro~ills were eluted with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and s~alated on 7% gels. 32P-collt~ining ~lOteills were vi.cl~li7~d by autoradiography. In vitro phosphorylated Jak2 was isolated from gel slices and the phosphoAmino acid content determined by published procedures (Cooper, J.A., et al., Methods Enz:ymol. 99:387~02 (1983)).           Results The spe~ ulll of protein tyrosine kinases expressed in hemat~oietic growth factor dependent cells was identifi~d by reverse ll~lccli~lase/polylll. lase chain reactions (RT/PCR) using degenelalive oligonucleotides coll~onding to the cons~.ved regions of the Iyl~ille kinase domain (Wilks, A.F., Methods Enzymol. 200:533-546 (1991)). One of the most frequently isolated cDNA clones was found to be identical to the clone FD17 (r~n~m~i Jak2) (Wilks, A.F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA86:1603-1607 (1989)).         wogs~o37ol ~63Q9~- '!. ' ~` PCT/uss4lo8676--Initial e~ s~ion analysis inrlir~t~(l that Jak2 was al,~ rl~"lly and widely e~ ssed in hematopoietic cells and ~rom~l~d us to obtain full length cDNA clones for functional studies. S~;leellillg of murine myeloid cDNA libraries resulted in the isolation of several overlapping clones, the longest of which (4 kb) contained the entire coding region of Jak2.The nucleotide sequence of Jak2 contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 3387 bp and the 5' end has three stop codons before the first ATG (Fig. 1). Although the first ATG does not fulfill the Kozak co,-~e~ fl~nking sequences, it is immPrli~t~ly followed by an ATG codon in the typical translation initiation envilol~llent (Kozak, M., Nucl. Acids Res. 15:8125-8148 (1987)). The 5' end does not contain an obvious signal peptide. The compiled size of the 3' llntran~l~ted region of the Jak2 clones is 0.9 kb which would correspond to a 4.4 kb transcript. One cDNA clone diverged at nucleotide 3271 and had a 1.4 kb 3' unt~an~l~ttq-d region.Tl~nscli~ for this cDNA would be 4.8 kb and may correspond to the larger LlanscliL)~ that is typically seen (see below).The Jak2 ORF encodes a protein of 1129 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 130 kDa. Hydrophilicity analysis, using the Kyte and Doolittle al~olilhlll, failed to identify tr~n~m~?n hrane regions.During the course of these studies, a partial sequence of Jak2 was published (Harpur, A.G., et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992)) which lacked the first 143 amino acids. A colll~alisol~ of the sequences in~ t~s 71 nucleotide dir~llces in the coding region, reslllting in 9 changes in amino acids (~ig. 1). The cDNA clones we have obtained did not contain the insert of 7 amino acids in position 711 that was found in one of four cDNA clones of the studies of Harpur et al. (Oncogene 7: 1347-1353 (1992))-The murine Jak2 gene is very closely related to other Jak family .ll~;lllb~l~ including the human Tyk2 and Jakl genes (42% and 43%identi~i~s respectively). We have also obtained full length cDNA clones for ~95/03701 68~9~ ~ PCT/US94/08676 the murine Jakl gene which has 45.5% identity to Jak2 at the nucleotide level in the coding region.Like other members of the family, the murine Jak2 protein has a 600 amino acid long N-l~ that lacks obvious SH2 or SH3 domains.S        Following this is a kinase related domain (domain 2) and a carboxyl kinase domain (dQm~in 1). The carboxyl kinase ~om~in contains all the structural and functional motifs associated with protein tyrosine kinases including the collselved residues in subdomains VI-VIII that are characteristically associated with protein lyloshle kinases (Hanks, S.K., et al., Science 241:42-52 (1988)). The subdomain VIII, which is hypothPsi7Pd to contribute to substrate recognition, shows a unique F-W-Y motif that is found in all Jak family mPm~ers. Domain 2 begins at amino acid 543 and all of the 11 consclved structural subdom~in~ of protein kinases can be ~ ?ntifiP,tl However, clear dirr~ ces in the amino acid composition and spacing in critical kinase sub~om~in~ I, II, VI and VIII (Hanks, S.K., et al., Science 241:42-52 (1988)) raise the possibility that this domain may have a regulatory function or all~ ively displays a ~lesclllly unknown substrate specificity.Although the N-lell~ s of the Jak family ~roLcills is less homologous than the kinase dom~in~ (36-39% verses 49-56%), colll~aliso of the N t~ 31 sequences of the Jak protein reveals several stretches of homology. Database searches with the N-termin~l sequence of Jak2 did not show .~ignifir~nt homology with other pro~cills but the presence of several highly COl~Sel ved amino acid domains show that Jak ~ro~cills are functionally related. Close c~ o,~ of the Jak homology lom~in 3 reveals some similaAty to SH2 dQJn~in.~, but the fimrtion~l signifir~nre of this sequ~nre similarity remains to be ~1PtenninPd The e~lcs~ion pattern of Jak2 was studied by Nor~ern blot analysis in the following muAne tissues: bone marrow, oviduct, ovary, testes, stom~r~ e,~ P, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, thymus, spleen, brain, fetal brain, fetal liver, fetal ;--le~ P, and fetal lung. The expression Wo 95/03701 c~ 3 PCT/USg4/08676 pattern of Jak2 was also studied by Northern blot analysis in the following cell lines: fibroblasts (NIH 3T3); myeloid cells (32D.3, NFS-70, NFS-107, NFS-124, DA-3, DA-22, DA-29, DA31, DA-24, M 1), a mast cell line (AFSTh2), B-cells (DA-8, NFS- 112, plasmacytoma), T-cells (DA-2, EL-4, R-12) and a macrophage cell line (BAC1.2F5). Two lldl~SC;li~ of 4.4 and 4.8 kb were dettocted in all tissues and cell lines tested, but the level ofeA~lession and the relative ab~ln~l~nre of the two ll~nscli~ varied. The smaller lli3.11SClipl was most abundalll in skeletal muscle, spleen and oviduct and barely detect~hle in liver, kidney and intestin~. The Jak2 expression level in adult liver was very low, whereas a more abundant message was etected in fetal liver. The Jak2 expression was iPtected in all 20 cell lines including 3T3 fibroblasts, B lymphoid, T lymphoid and a variety of myeloid cells l~ S~ g different stages of dirr~lcllLialion and growth requirements.In order to biochlomic~lly characterize Jak2 protein, anti-peptide ~nti~-?r~ were prepared against a region (amino acids 758-776 (SEQ IDNO:5)) that was unique for Jak2 relative to the murine Jakl. To initially assess the r~a;liviLy of this antiserum, ;..-,..~ nprcci~ildlions were done with in vitro ~ylllllP~ od Jak2. In vitro tr~n~l~tion of Jak2 RNA gave an expecteA 130 kDa protein. This 130 kDa protein was il~ nplcci~ dled by the Jak2 anti-peptide antiserum, but not by an irrelevant allLise,~plc~dlcd against a peptide, the sequence of which is not found in Jak2.T....     o~lecipitdtion was competed by the homologous peptide to which the Jak2 antiserum was raised, but not by an irrelevant peptide or by a peptide that is the homologous region of Jakl. The Jak2 anti-peptide a"liselulll did not immllnn~lccipildte in vitro synth~si7~d Jakl. Lastly the Jak2 anti-peptide a,l~iselul" also immllnoprecipitated a comparable 130 kDa protein from in vivo methionine labeled cells which was specifically co--.l~elt;d by the homologous peptide. These results demc"L~Ildte that the Jak2 cDNAencodes a protein of 130 kDa and that the allli~cpLide an~iselulll specifically recognizes the Jak2 protein.

We ~lt~erol~ ex~n~ od the possibility that Jak2 might be a substrate of tyrosine phs)sphorylation.Western blotting of total cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) d~tect~d the a~e~ re of several plol~ s following IL-3 stimlll~tion~ including a broad band at 130-140 kDa, a minor band at 70 kDa and major bands at 55 kDa, 50 kDa and 38 kDa.When cell extracts were immnnoprecipitated with the Jak2 anti-peptide alllisel~l, a 130 kDa protein was readily ~letectecl in stimlll~tçd cells but not in ~ ted cells. Also of note is the presence of in~ cecl plo~eills of 110 kDa, 70 kDa and 60 kDa that coi..    ~ ..  ~leci~ led with Jak2.These substrates have been coi~iC~ y seen in illll~ plecipitations of Jak2. ~ ple.,i~iLalion with an ~lLise:lulll against the murine Jakl con~i~ntly ~letectecl a weak band at 130 kDa inrlir~ting that Jakl may also be a substrate. Inducible lylosil~e phosphorylation of the IL-3 ~B chain was observed in extracts immllnu~leci~i~L~d with c~IL3R~ antiserum as a diffuse band with a slightly reduced mobility relative to Jak2 in IL-3 stim--1~t~d cells. Thus the broad band seen in total cell lysates col~isL~ of both Jak2 and the IL-3 ,B chain.To fur~er establish that IL-3 inAIlces Jak2 Lylosil~e phosphorylation, the kin~tics of the re~ollse and the ability to detect in~l~lction with a secondmonoclonal antibody against phospho~ylosille were çx~ i.lP~l When cells were stim~ ted with IL-3 and the phosphotyrosine co..~ fraction was isolated by binding to and elution from seph~.ruse beads co~t~ining the lG2 ~ntiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, Jak2 was readily ~letçct~(l in Western blots using the Jak2 anti-peptide antiserum. A comparable 130 kDa band was not ~letected in Il~ ;-"--l~t~l cells.     WOs5/03701 2~68Q9~ PCT/US94/08676 Jak2 lyloshle phosphorylation was readily a~ar~llL following 5 min of IL-3 stim~ tion and subseqllently decreased in a mal~l~r comparable to the general pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation seen following IL-3 stim~ tion (Isfort, R., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 19203-19209 (1988)).During this period (from 0-120 mimltes after IL-3 stimlll~tion) there was no change in the levels of Jak2 as ~c~sse~l by Western blotting with the Jak2 anti-peptide a lLise..llll.To determine whether IL-3 binding affected Jak2 kinase activity, cells were stimlll~te~l with IL-3 for 10 min, Jak2 was immlmoprecipitated and in vitro kinase assays were performed. The results are shown in Figure 4. When extr~ct~ were immnn~pl~ci~iL~ted with normal rabbit serum, no in vitro kinase activity was detectecl with extr~rtc from trd or stimlll~te-d cells. However, when extracts were immllnnplt;ci~iL~ted with Jak2 anti-peptide antiserum, a 130 kDa was readily detçctç(l with extracts from IL-3 stim~ tr~ cells that co-mi~r~d with the imml-nnprecipitated Jak2. By contrast, the 130 kDa band was not (1etecterl when extracts of Illl~;...lll~tPd cells were used. Phospho~minn acid analysis of the 130 kDa band demonstrated the plt;sellce of predo,-,;"~ y phosphotyrosine.     Interestingly, there were no other major protein bands phosphorylated in these in vitro reactions, innl~l-1in~ the heavy chain of IgG(Fig. 3). As ~ cllsse(l below this may reflect the substrate ~ecirlcily of Jak2 kinase. The specificity for Jak2 is inrlic~te~l by the ability of the corresponding peptide to block ~r~ci~i~Lion of kinase activity while a peptide to the corresponding region of Jakl had no effect. Together the data demo~ e that IL-3 stim~ tion results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and activation of its autophosphorylation activity. ~ ion ~tl 95/03701 ~ g PCTIUS94/08676 Our studies provide the first complete sequence of the murine Jak2 gene. Three lines of evidence in~lir~te that the cDNA clones we have obtained contain the entire coding region. First, co~ alison of the murine Jak2 5' seq lenre with the published seq lenres of human Tyk2 and Jakl show that all ~fOl~illS start at the same site. Secon~, the first ATG is preceded by stop codons in all reading frames. Lastly, the sizes of the compiled cDNA sizes are co~ with the 4.4 and 4.8 kb sized S~The seq~lenre of our murine Jak2 cDNAs varies from the published partial sequence of the gene (Harpur, A.G., et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992)) and inrl~ldes nine amino acid changes, seven of which are colls~l valive ~lh~ it)ne Our cDNA clones lacked an insert of 7 amino acids found in one of four Jak2 cDNA clones in the published seq~lenre. Asimilar ~u~live additional exon was also observed in the human Iyk2 cDNA (Vel~7-ln~7, L., et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992)).IL-3 stimlll~tion of helllatol,oietic growth factor dependent cells has been shown to rapidly induce tyrosine ph. sphorylation of a number of cellular ~ul~L~ales (Ihle, J.N., in Interleukins: Molecular Biology and Immunology, Kiehimoto, T., ed., Karger, Basel, pp. 65-106 (1992); Ihle, J.N., in Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors, Sporn and Roberts, eds., Springer Verlag, New York (1990)). Our results dem~" sll~le that one of these substrates is Jak2 (Ihle, J.N., in Interleukins: Molecular Biology and Immunology, Kiehimoto, T., ed., Karger, Basel, pp. 65-106 (1992)). Among the protein tyrosine kinases that are ~A~lessed in IL-3 dependent cells and which we could ~x;,~ t?, there was a le~ ble specificity for Jak2.In particular, we have not l~tected any çll~nges in the tyrosine phosphorylation of lyn, tec or c-fes. However we have coneiet~ntly seen a low level of Iylosine phosphorylation of Jakl following IL-3 stim~ tiQn.This is not due to cross-lcaclivily of the alllisela used and, since both Jakl and Jak2 are ~A~res~ed at col.l~alable levels in the cells, is not due to wo 95/03701 ~ 6~9~ PCT/USg4/08676 dirrclcllces in protein levels. ThclcÇolc, it is likely that Jakl shares s lffirient similarity to Jak2 to weakly associate with the IL-3 receptor complex. Alternatively, since there is considerable sequence homology bcLwccll Jakl and Jak2 at t_e potential autophosphorylation site, Jakl may be a substrate for Jak2. To date, we have not ~letecte~l an effect of IL-3 stim~ tion on Jakl in vitro kinase activity.IL-3 stim~ tion results in both the induction of Ly,u~i.,e phospholylation of Jak2 and activation of Jak2 in vitro kinase activity. The carboxyl protein ~ylu~ille kinase domain of Jak2 contains the characteristic autophosphorylation site that is associated with the activation kinase activity of a number of kinases (Hanks, S.K., et al., Science 241:42-52 (1988)).The in vivo tyrosine phosphorylation is expected to occur at this site based on the collcollliLanl appe~ e of tyrosine phosphorylation and ~letect~hle in vitro kinase activity.The re~luh~,lllcllL for IL-3 binding for (letection of kinase activity inr1ir~t~s that Jak2 kinase activity is highly regulated in cells, con~i~tent with a major role in growth regulation. The plullal.y sul~LldLe of the in vitro kinase reactions was Jak2. In particular, there was no detect~ble phosphorylation of immlmoglobulins nor is enolase a substrate for Jak2, inrli-~ting that Jak2 may have a strict substrate specificity. The requirement for receptor activation and the substrate specificity may account for the inability to demol~LlaL~ Jakl protein Lylosille kinase activity under a variety of conditions in previous studies (WiLks, A.F., et al., Mol.Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991)).Jak2 is also Lylosille phosphorylated and activated following EPOstim~ tion (see Example 2). Moreover, these studies demo~ l that Jak2 physically associates with a membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO lcce~Lor (EPOR) that is essential for f1lnrtion Whether Jak2 physically ~csoci~t~s with one or both subunits of the IL-3 receptor is ~;ullellLly being e~min~cl However, like EPOR, the ,~     Jl~95/03701 `t6SO98 PCT/US94/08676 subunit of the IL-3 ,cc~lor is rapidly Iylusille phosphorylated and it can be hypoth~si7~od that this phosphorylation is me~ ted by Jak2.In the case of EPOR, Iy~osille phosphorylation occurs at sites in the cytoplasmic, carboxyl end and this region is not required for mitogenesis.Whether the lyro~hle pho~hu,ylation of the IL-3 ,B subunit contributes to the biological response is not known.     The ability of both IL-3 and EPO to induce the lyro~le phosphorylation and activation of Jak2 shows the possibility that Jak2 may be a cun~o,lellt in the signal transducing pathways of several cytokine ,-_~pto~. We have also found that GM-CSF and G-CSF induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. This is coll~ ellL with several studies that have shown that these hematopoietic growth factors induce comparable .-c of tyrosine phosphorylation (Ihle, J.N., in Interleukins: Molecular Biology and Im~nunology, ~i~himoto, T., ed., Karger, Basel, pp. 65-106 (1992)). We have also observed tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 in response to IFN~y in a macrophage cell line.The helllalu~oietic growth factor receptors are members of a leCepll)r supt;,r~llily that also includes the rec~plOl~ for growth hormone, the prolactin r~ce,uL()l~ ciliary n~ulull~ic factor and others (Bazan, J.F., Science 257:410-413 (1992)). Moreover, the ,~,ceplo,~ for hll~,r~,.ull, although more distantly related, have been spec~ t~cl to have evolved from a common progenitor. Recent studies (Vel~7~ o7., L., et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992)) have shown that Tyk2 is involved in IFN~ sign~lling.Our studies have shown that Jak2 are involved in the .cign~lling palllways of IL-3 and EPO (see Example 2) as well as G-CSF, GM-CSF and IFN~y. In addition, recent studies have implicated Jak2 in the response to growth hormone. Thelerore Jak family kinases are involved in the signal tr~n~ cing pathways utilized by several members of the cytokine/illl~lre.oll ~u~elr~llily of lC;:~IUl~. Moreover, the Jak family of kinases may also regulate gene e~lcssion through comparable pathways involving family members related to the ISGF3a~ proteins (schinlller~ C., WO 95/03701       '2~ j~6~        62-                  PCT/US94/08676 et al., Proc.

EPOR is a member of the cytokine receptor family and contains a cytoplasmic domain that lacks an identifiable kinase catalytic cloln~in Binding of EPO, however, rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of EPOR as well as a number of cellular ploteills. The ability to induce Iylosi,le phosphorylation is tightly correlated with the ability of the l~c~or to induce ll~nscli~lion of immP(li~te early genes and to be mitogenic. These biological responses have been shown to require a membrane proximal region of the receptor cytoplasmic domain. Here we demo~ d~e that one of the substrates of protein tyrosine phosphorylation is the 130 lcl)a Jak2, a protein tyrosine kinase. Moreover, EPO stim~ ti-)n activates Jak2 in vitro autophosphorylation activity. Using a series of of EPOR, the in~ ctic)n of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation and autopho*,h~lylation activity were found to correlate with the induction of biological lespollses. Furthermore, we show that Jak2 physically associates with the membrane proximal region of the EPOR cytoplasmic domain that is required for biological activity. Together the results in~ te that Jak2 is the kinase that couples EPO binding to tyrosine phosphorylation and nltim~tely the biological responses that are required for elylllrol)oiesis.        95/03701 ~93 PCT/US94/08676 -63- f Introd~tion ~P~ oiesis is regulated through the i,.l~la~;lion of a variety of hc~l~alo~oic~ic growth factors with their cognate lcC~Ol~ (Clark and K~m~Pn, Science 236: 1229-1237 (1987); Metcalf D. Nature 339:27-30 (1989)). The majority of hematopoietic growth factor receptors belong to a common cytokine lcccplor family that is cha,aclc,~d by the ~,cse"ce of four po.~ition~lly consc, ved cysteines and a WSXWS (SEQ ID NO: 1) motif in the extracellular domain.

The EPO receptor (EPOR) was cloned by e~ asion cloning (D'Andrea et al., Cell 57:277-285 (1989)) and the seq~en~e of the cDNA predicts a protein of 507 amino acids with a single membrane-.sp~ domain and the motifs associated with the cytokine ,ec~lol ~u~e.r~llily. Unlike several sf the hc",a~opoietic growth factor lecc~lol~ a single gene product has been shown to be sl-fflriPnt for EPObinding and function (D'Andrea et al., CeU 57:277-285 (1989)).Intro(lllction of the EPOR into IL-3 dependent cell lines confers on the cells the ability to proliferate in response to EPO and this has provided an important model to study ,cceplol signal tr~n~nction (D'Andrea et al., Cell 57:277-285 (1989); Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)). In ~ rcclcd cells, EPO induces the e~lession of a series of immPAi~tP. early genes including c-myc, c-fos, c-pim-1 and egr-1 (Miura et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993)). In addition, EPO induces the rapid ~ylosille phosphorylation of a series of cellular substrates (~.innP~in et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6237-6241 (1992);Dusanter-Fourt et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10670-10675 (1992); Quelle and WO 95/03701 ,, .; ' PCT/US94/08676 ?,~6S~9 -64-Wojchowski, J. Biol.

Biol.12:706-715 (1992); Damen et al., Blood 80:1923-1932 (1992)), suggesting that EPOR may function by coupling ligand binding to the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase. One of the substrates of EPO in(l~lred tyrosine phosphorylation is the receptor (Dusa~ r-Fourt et al., J. Biol. Chem.267:10670-10675 (1992); yo~l~i",.ll~ and T orlieh, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992); Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)).The cytoplasmic domain of EPOR consists of 236 amino acids and contains some amino acid seql!enl~e similarity to the cytoplasmic domain of the IL-2 receptor ~B chain (D'Andrea et al., Cell 58: 1023-1024 (1989)).EPOR also contains a region that has similarity to the cytokine receptor conse~ d domains, termed box 1 and 2, which were initially defined in the IL-6 signal transducing gpl30 protein (M~lr~k~mi et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 88:11349-11353 (1991)). The membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain has been shown to be eee~ l for the biological activities of the ltceplor. Carboxyl llullcation of 108 amino acids has no effect on the ability of the receptor to induce immPrli~te early genes, induce tyrosine phosphorylation or cause mitogenesis (Miura et al., Mol. Cell.Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993); Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)). In some cells lines, carboxyl Llullcalions have increased the mitogenic response (D'Andrea et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:1980-1987 (199la)), suggeslillg that the membrane distal region negatively affects the response to EPO.Within the membrane proximal region, carboxyl l~ cations or deletions of the box 1 and box 2 ~lom~in~ can inactivate the receptor for all biological activities (Miura et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993);Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)). The importance of this region was further demol~l.aled by the inactivation of l~,ceplor functions by mutation of a conserved Trp residue between box 1 and box 2.Together the results demonstrate that the membrane proximal region of J!~95,03701 689~&~ PCT/US94/08676 EPOR is e~cçnti~l for all the biological responses that have been e~min~d, including the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation.Although the u,l~u,L~ce of EPOR to couple to protein tyrosine phosphory-lation for biological activities has been clearly demo~ dLe:d, very little has been known collce~ g the kinases that might be involved.The rapid induction of lylo~ e phosphorylation of the carboxyl region of EE'OR (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895~902 (1991); Yo~il,i",~ . and Lodish, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-71~ (1992); Dusanter-Fourt et al., J. Biol.Chem. 267:10670-10675 (1992)) suggests that the receptor is closely associated with a kinase either consLilulively or following ligand binding.One study (Yoshilnuld and Lodish, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992)) i~lentifiPd a non-glycosylated protein of 130 kDa that could be cross-linked with the receptor and which was tyrosine phosphorylated either in vivo or in in vitro kinase assays as ~sesse~ by its ability to be lPt~cte~l by an antiphospholylo~ e antibody.

The Tyk2 gene wo 95/03701 2 ~ 6 8 ~ ~ ~ PCT/USs4/08676 product has rec~lllly been implicated in signal tr~n~duction through the illl~lÇ.,roll a (INF~ ecel)lol (Velazquez et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992)).To explore the potential role of Jakl and Jak2 genes in hematopoietic signal tran~hlction we have isolated full-length cDNA clones for the murine genes and ~lG~alc~d ~l~isela against the ploleills (see Example 1).We report here that EPO stimlll~tiQn rapidly induces the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and activates its in vitro kinase activity. The in~ ction of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of kinase activity is dependent upon a membrane proximal region of the EPOR cytoplasmic domain ~at is es~e.,~;~l for mitogenesis. Finally, we demol~l,ate that Jak2 physically associates with the EPOR and this ~soci~tion requires the ;llll,lalle proximal region. Together the data demol~LlaLe that Jak2 is involved in EPOR signal tr~n~dllction.              Results Jak2 is Specif-cally and Rapidly Tyrosine Phosphorylated Following EPO S~ tion EPO rapidly induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular sukstr~tes, including the receptor for EPO, suggesting that the receptor associates with a cytoplasmic Iyrosille kinase(s) (yO!~l.;.l.~-.~ et al., Nature 348:647-649 (1990); Damen et al., Blood 80: 1923-1932 (1992);Quelle and Wojchowski, J.

USA 89:6237-6241 (1992); Dusanter-Fourtetal., J. Biol. Chem. 267:10670-10675 (1992)). To identify the kinases that might be involved, we and others (WiLks, A.F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1603-1607 (1989); Wilks et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991); PalL~lell et al., Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 87:8913-8917 (1990); see Example 1) have used PCR 95/03701  ~   PCT/USg4l08676 approaches to detect known and potentially novel kinases that are present in hematopoietic growth factor dependent cell lines. These studies, coupled with Northern blot analysis, identified L~ansc~ for Iyn, c-fes, tec, Jak1 and Jak2 in DA3 myeloid cells (Mano et al., Oncogene 8:417~24 (1993)). To initially ~ e~ ",;"~ whether any of these kinases might be involved in EPO signal tr~n~d~lction we ex~min~d their ability to be induce ~ylOSil¢ phosphorylated as follows. DA3(EPOR) cells were removed from growth factors for a~ru~ ately 14 hr. The cells were either not stim-ll~ted (-) or stimlll~te~l (+) with 30 U/ml of human EPO for 10 ...     i.~ . The cells were subseqllently collected by cellllif~lgation and cell extracts ~r~al~d as described in E~crilllen~l Procedures below. Aliquots of extracts (2 x 107 cells) from ~ te~ and stimlll~tt ~l cells were n~lcci~ ted with anLi;~clà against Jak2, Jakl, c-fes, lyn or tec. The ;Illlllllnl~plcci~i~lcs were resolved by SDS-PAGE, llal~rulllled to nitrocellulose filters and the filters were probed with the 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody as described in Experim~ont~l Procedures. To assess the levels of each of the immllnoprecipitated tyrosine kinases, comparable blots were probed with antisera against the individual kinases as described in Experim~nt~l Procedures below.In e~ nt described above, EPO stimlll~tion resulted in the a~eala,llce of a pl30 kDa band that was illllll~ ~cipilaled by an allli~c..~ against Jak2. This band was not observed when the opleci~i~lion was done in the presence of the peptide to which the ~Li~e..llll was raised. Comparable results were also obtained when the ~ 25        blots were probed with a dirr~ monoclonal antibody against phospho~ylosille (PY20). In contrast, there was no a~alelll induction of ~yl~ille phosphorylation of lyn, fes or tec under comparable conditions.A weak 130 kDa band was seen with antiserum against Jakl in several t~ con~ ctecl as described above. This was not due to the cross-reactivity of the anlise-a. Both antisera were pl~al~d against WO 95/03701 ?.,~.6/~09 ` PCT/US94/08676 --peptides with minim~l seq~lenre identity be~wcen Jakl and Jak2 and only o~Lcci~iLdte the ~plo~liate kinase from in vitro translation reactions (see Example 1). Together the results show that the Jak kinases are inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EPO but that Jak2 is ~l~efclclllially phosphorylated.     To further establish that EPO stim~ tion induces lyro~ e phosphorylation of Jak2, we ex; -~ cl the ability of the monoclonal antibody lG2 to detect changes in phosphorylation. Cells were treated as above, lysed and the phosphotyrosine cont~ining fraction of pluLcillS was isolated by binding to and elution from lG2 monoclonal antibody sepharose beads as previously described (Frackelton et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 3: 1343-1352 (1983); Isfort et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263: 19203-19209 (1988)). The eluted plu~ s were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted to filters and the filters were probed with an antiserum against Jak2. The results were as follows. EPO in(l~-ce-l the ay~Je~ re of a pl30 kDa band that was readily (letect~hle with the antiserum against Jak2 in the lG2 eluates. Western blotting of total cell lysates in(lir~t~d comparable levels of the pl30 kDa Jak2 in both stim-~l~te~l and -.,~ tt~l cells. Probing of blots with antisera against lyn, tec or c-fes failed to detect these kinases.To deL~ e the kin.otics of a~&~ e~ of tyrosine phosphorylated Jak~, extracts from DA3(EPOR) cells were pl~a~d at 0, 5, 10, 30 and 60 mim~teS following EPO tre~tment i~ plccipiLdled with antisera against Jak2 and the imm~mnpreci~iLalt;s were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The pLOt~illS were Llal~rellcd to nitrocellulose and Western blotted with the 4G10 monoclonal antibody. Under these conditions the inrl~ tion of a 130 kDa band was readily evident. Stim~ tion was m~xim~l at 5 min and subsequently ~leclinPcl and was not evident at 1 hour.Together the above results intlir~te~l that EPO stimlll~tion results in the rapid and specific lylo~ e phos~llolylation of Jak2, relative to other protein tyrosine kinases, in growth factor dependent cells.           95/03701 21 ~8098 PCT/USg4/08676 EPO ,~ 7tien Activates Jak2 ln Vitro Kinase Activity Tyrosine phosphorylation of protein tyrosine kinases is commonly ~csoc;~l~d with the activation of kinase activity (Hanks et al., Science 241:42-52 (1988)). We tht.~r~ fd the in vitro Jak2 kinase activity in imml~nn~ci~ s. In these e,~elilllell~ cells were stimnl~ted with EPO for 10 -~ s, then cell extracts were ~ altd and illlllllll~leei~i~Led with either normal rabbit serum (NRS) or antiserum specific for Jak2, in vitro kinase assays were performed and the phosphorylated proteills resolved by SDS-PAGE. T.--.-~ ci~itates of eALla~;L~ with normal rabbit serum, from ..  ~ ted or EPO stim~ t~d cells, had no Açtect~hle in vitro kinase activity. In contrast, o~eci~i~Les of extr~rt~ with Jak2 anlise.ul-- from EPO stim~ t~d cells had readily Açtect~le kinase activity. The major product of phosphorylation was a 130 kDa protein that co-migrated with Jak2. Acomparable activity was not AetP-cteA in extracts from ..    ~ t~A cells.The ~ecificily for Jak2 was i"-lir;~e(l by the ability of the peptide to which the Jak2 anlise.~l was raised to block ;.-.. ..~.ecipitation of kinase activity while a peptide to the comparable region of Jakl had no effect.The plilllaly phospho~mino acid in the in vitro kinase assays ~letçcteA. by 2 Aim~n~ional thin layer electrophoresis was A~ t~- . . .;  .~d to be tyrosine. Tyrosine Phosphoryla~on of Jak2 and Activation of In Vitro Kinase Activity Correla~es with Mitogenesis -  Our previous studies (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:48954902 (1991); Miura et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993)) defined a membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain of EP(~R that is ç~sPnti~l for inAl~ction of Iylosille pho~ho,ylation, inA~lction of the eA~ ssion of several immPAi~te early genes and for mitogenesis. It was therefore important to Aet~ ;..P whether the inAIl~tinn of Jak2 WO 95/03701       - ~                                  PCT/US94/08676 6~98       70 phosphorylation required a colllpaldble domain and whether Jak2 phosphorylation could be correlated with these biological responses. We Illelero,~, ex;~ d EPO-in~ ced ly~usille phcsphQrylation m~di~t~d by a series of mllt~t~d receptors. The H mutant of EPOR lacks the carboxyl le~..     i-.~l 108 amino acids but retains complete biological activity (Miura etal., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993)).EPO stimnl~tion of cells e~lcsshlg the H mutant resulted in the ~ylo~ine phosphorylation of a 130 kDa band. It should also be noted that the observed Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation with cells e~lessillg the Hmutant was stronger than with cells e~ lcs~illg the wild-type lec~lor. This could be due to somewhat higher levels of Jak2, as in~ tt-d in the lower panel, or could be due to the removal of a negatively acting domain in the carboxyl region of the lecepLor (D'Andrea et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:1980-1987 (1991)). Also of note in these e~e~ is the pl~;sellce of an inducible 72 kDa phosphoprolein that is detecte~l in the Jak2 ;Illlllllll~l~cipiL~tt;s from extra~t~ of cells e~resSillg the wild-type receptor.This is the size expect~d for EPOR and the possibility that it is EPOR is further supported by the absence of a comparable band in the e~e,illlents with the H mutant in which the carboxyl L~ulca~ion removes the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)). This obs~ Lion showed that EPOR may physically ~oci~te with Jak2.Carboxyl deletiQ~ that extend further than the H mllt~nt such as is present in the S mutant which lacks the carboxyl 146 amino acids of the l~cel,lor, inactivate the receptor for induction of tyrosine phosphorylation, induction of the imm~ te early genes and mitogenesis in DA-3 cells (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:489~-4902 (1991)). No induction of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation was evident following EPO stimnl~tion of cells e~l~,ia~ g this mutant.We also previously demol~LlaLed that the deletion of 20 amino acids (PB mutant) in the membrane proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain 95/03701 21 G8l~98pcT/us94/o8676 inactivates the receptor for all biological activities. No tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was det~cted in EPO treated cells expressing this mllt~nt, Lastly we e~min~-l a point mllt~nt PM4, which contains the S          illa~ dLing mutation W282 to R of the consel ved W residue beLw~ell the box 1 and box 2 regions (Miura et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993)). No Iy~ e phosphory-lation of Jak2 was seen in cells e~lessing this mllt~nt We next ~x~ the correlation belweell in(hlçtion of Jak2 Iyç~sille phosphorylation and m-itogenesis with the ability to activate in vitroJak2 kinase activity. Clones of cells ekples~illg the various mutant cce~lol~ were either not stiml~l~ted or stim~ t~d with EPO for 10 min.The cells were lysed and Jak2 was immllnoplc;~ dted and the ~le~ i~iLdl~s used in in vitro kinase assays as above. Phosphorylations were ~ccç,cced by resolving the ;..     ~.,pleci~ildles by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.As in the previously described results, the major product of phosphorylation ~lçtçctç(l in the reactions was a 130 kDa phosphoproleill that migr~t~s at the position of Jak2. Phosphorylation of Jak2 was evident in cells stimlll~t~(l with EPO that ~ ssed the mitogeni~lly active Hmllt~nt No kinase activity was ~lçtt ct~d in immlmoprecipitates of EPOstimlll~t~d cells-expressing the mitogenie~lly inactive S truncation mllt~tion, the PB deletion mutant or the PM4 point mnt~nt These results demol~Lldle that the me,ll~ e proximal region, which is e.c~enti~l for biological activity, is also required for in~llction of Jak2 tyrosine phospholylaIion and for activation of its kinase activity. Induchon of Jak Tyrosine Phosphoryla~ion in 3T3 Cells E~ s~l,.g EPOR Jak2 is expressed in a wide variety of cell lineages (see Example 1);Harpur et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992)). We therefore ~letertnjn~l WO 95/0371)l 6~09~ ` ~ PCT/US94/08676--whether Jak2 might couple with EPOR and be inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in a non-hematopoietic lineage. For this, we e~min~d the response of 3T3 fibroblasts that had been ~ r~;led with EPOR ex~lession constructs and express high affinity lccept~, for EPO.To initially determine whether EPO stim~ tio n is coupled to lylo~ e phosphorylation in fibroblasts e~ ;,sing the lece~lor, the ability of EPO to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular pl`oleills as well as the receptor was e~ 1.";~-~d When blots of extracts from 3T3(EPOR) cells were probed with a antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, a variety of bands were ~1etect~d and no tlPt~ct~ble differences were seen in cells treated with EPO. However, when the extracts were first i..",-,-.-op,ecipitated with an antiserum against EPOR and the blots were probed for phosphotyrosine c~ i"ii~ pl~oteills, a 72 kDa protein was det~cted in EPO stimlll~t-od cells, consistent with the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of EPOR.When cell extracts were first i.~ oprecipitated with a,llisc;-u,--against Jak2 and then Western bloKed for phosphotyrosine cont~inin~p,vl~i. s or Jak2, the results obtained were as follows. T..     ~ .cipitates from ...~li...lll~t~l and EPO stim~ t~qd fibroblasts contained comparable levels of Jak2 as ~esessed by probing the blots with an antiserum against Jak2 . Following stimlll~tion of the cells with EPO, a 130 kDa band, co-migrating with Jak2, was readily detecte(l by a monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10). A co~ alable band was not detected in control fibroblasts that did not contain EPOR. These data demol~llale that EPORcan functionally couple with Jak2 in fibroblasts and me(li~t~. EPO in~ ed tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2.              Jak2 Associntes with Mitogenically Active RPceptors for Erythropoietin The rapid inrhlction of tyrosine phosphorylation of EPOR and Jak2 showed the possibility that Jak2 physically associates with EPOR. This ~ 95/03701 8 0 3 8 ? r~ S PCT/US94/08676 possibility was particularly inkiguing since previous studies (YOsl~ ula and T~dich, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992)) icl~ntifiPd a 130 kDa protein which could be cross-linked to EPOR and which could be phosphQrylated in vitro. The possibility of an association of Jak2 and S             EPOR was also inriic~tçd in several e~ llelll~ in which a phosphotyrosine cont~ining 72 kDa protein co-;.~ precipi~ted with Jak2.To directly e~ the ability of Jak2 to physically associate with EPO, a series of GST (glutathione-S-transferase)-fusion plolt;i.ls cont~ining the cytoplasmic dom~inc of wild type and mutant EPORs were constructed and e~lc;ssed in b~ct~ri~. The fusion ~lO~ lS were purified by affinity binding to gll~t~thione-s~harose beads and the ~loleins, on affinity beads, were i~ ed with extracts of l-.l~l;---.ll~te-l or EPO stim~ ted DA3(EPOR) cells. The bound pr~teil~c were recovered from the beads, resolved on SDS-PAGE and the gels blotted to nitrocellulose. The blots were subseqlllontly probed with a,llise.à against various tyrosine kinases.A 130 kDa protein was readily ~let.ect~hle when extracts from either ;"..ll~t~d or stim~ t~d cells were used and the blots were probed with an ~lLiseluL" against Jak2. The 130 kDa protein was not llçtçctçd when the ~liselulll was i~ ub~led with an excess of the peptide to which it was raised. A 130 kDa protein was also ~toctç~l with an allliselulll against Jakl, ~ltho~lgh at much lower levels than that seen with antiserum against Jak2. Bands were not detectçd that would be concictçnt with the ~lesence of lyn, c-fes or tec when the blots were probed with the l~,s~eclive ~"li~These results demo~L al~d that among the Iyrosil~e kinases ex~..  ,ill~d, Jak2 ~oci~tçd with the GST fusion protein cont~inin~ the cytoplasmic dom~in of EPOR.If the physical acsoci~tion of Jak2 and EPOR ~lçtect~d above was biologically relevant it might be predicted that mutations which affect the l~)tol~s mitogenic activity would alter binding and, collve~ely, L~ lion~ of the receptor that do not affect biological activity would not WO 95/03701 ~ 74 PCT/US94/08676 affect binding. To explore this possibility, fusion plvlcills were constructed that contained the cytoplasmic portion of the Ll~ Pd, but mitogenically active, H mutant as well as the mitogenically inactive PB and PM4 ".--~ . When cell e~ctr~t~ were in~b~t~d with GST alone bound to gll~t~thione-sepharose and the blots were probed with an antiserum against Jak2, a 130 kDa protein was not detect~d. In contrast, when fusion o~eins c~nt~inin~ either the complete cytoplasmic domain or the carboxyl-L1~ (CC1 cytoplasmic domain of the H mutant were used, a 130 kDa protein was readily ~letect~ble. The 130 kDa protein was not det~cte when extracts were in~ b~t~d with a fusion protein cont~ining the PBmutant deletion. However, the 130 kDa protein was ~letect~d when a fusion protein cont~ining the mitogeni~ ~lly inactive PM4 mutation was used. This may be due to the dirrc.~ ces in the assays to detect functional verses physical int~r~ctions as ~ cl~se~l below. These results show that the membrane proximal domain that is required for mitogenesis also m~ t~s the association of EPOR and Jak2.          Di.~ ion These studies are the first to identify a protein tyrosine kinase that ~scoci~t~s with EPOR and which is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in response to ligand binding. Previous studies have demo,-~l"-~d that EPObill~i~g rapidly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular ~ub~Ll~lcS, as well as EPOR, and that this ability is tightly coupled to the in~ rtion of mitogel~esis (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991); Miura et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1788-1795 (1993)). Thclcrolc there has been considerable interest in idellliryill~ the kinase (or kinases) that couples EPObinding to the biological respollses. Using PCR approaches (Wilks, A.F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:1603-1607 (1989); Wilks, A.F., Meth.Er~mol. 200:533-546 (1991); P~lL~lell et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA87:8913-8917 (1990); Mano et al., Oncogene 8:417424 (1993)), aUclll~L~          95/03701 ~ p PCT/US94/08676 have been made to define the ~e~ ull~ of protein tyrosine kinases that are present in myeloid cells and which might contribute to signal L~ ion Among the kinases ~ressed in IL-3/EPO clPpen~1Pnt cells, there v           has been an interest in Iyn, a mPmher of the src gene family kinase, in S        signal ~ n~ clion. This was based on the demonstration that IL-2 stim~ tion of T cells causes an h~,~ ase in the kinase activity of the highly related lck kinase (Horak et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 1996-2000 (1991)) and the demonstration of a physical association of lck with the cytoplasmic dom~in of the IL-2 receptor ~B chain (Hatakeyama et al., Science 252:1523-1528 (1991)). It should be noted however, that lck associates with a region of the IL-2 receptor ,~ chain which is not required for mitogenesis (Hatakeyama et al., Cell 59:837-845 (1989); Hatakeyama et al., Science 252: 1523-1528 (1991)). A role for Iyn in IL-3 signal tr~n~chlction was i~ d by a report showing that IL-3 stimlll~tion induces an hlcl~ase in Iyn kinase activity (Torigoe et al., Blood 80:617-624 (1992)). However, we have been unable to see a co~ e~ll effect of either I~3 or EPO on Iyn kinase activity in the he",al~oietic growth factor ~epe~ nt cells we have ex~minPd. As illustr~tefl here, we have also been unable to detect any effect of EPO binding on the state of Ly~o~ e phosphorylation of lyn nor have we been able to demo~LI~t~ ~soci~tion of lyn with EPOR.We have also been unable to detect any t~h~nges in tec tyrosine ph~ Jhorylation, activation of kinase activity or association with EPOR.Tec is e~,t:ssed in myeloid cells (Mano et al., Oncogene 8:417-424 (1993)) and its potential importance has been suggested by the identification of highly related kinases in T-cells, itk (IL-2 inducible T cell kinase) and in B-cells BPB/atk (B-cell progel~,Lol kinase, ~g~mm~globlllinl?mi~ tyrosine kinase) (Silicano et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA ~9: 11194-11198 (1992); Tsukada et al., Cell (in press, 1993); Vetrie et al., Nature 361:226-233 (1993)). The BPK/atk gene is tightly linked to X-linked ~g~mm~globl~lin~ (XLA) and kinase activity is reduced or absent in WO ~S/037nl ? ~ -76- ~CT/US94/U8C76 XLA pre-B and B-cell lines (Tsukada et al., Cell (in press, 1993)).Moreover, genPtirAlly acquired mutations that would be predicted to inactivate the kinase have been ~lPtPcted in BPK/atk in patients with ~LA(Vetrie et al., Nature 361:226-233 (1993)). Thelefol~ BPK/atk is likely to S         play a critical role in B-cell si~nAlling. The possibility that tec is involved in a more specialized responses of myeloid cells is ;ul~ell~ly being eYAminPcl We have also not observed evidence for a role for the c-fes gene in EPO signal transducing pathways that regulate cell proliferation. Recent studies have suggested that c-fes may be involved in the terminAl dirrel~llliation of myeloid cells (Borellini et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 15850-15854 (1991)) since the levels of c-fes e~ ,F,sion hlcr~,ase with dirrel~llliation7 introduction of an activated form of c-fes into myeloid cells promotes their dirr~,.cllLiation (Borellini et al., J. Biol. Chem. 266: 15850-15854 (1991)) and c-fes Anti~çrl~e Col~7LluClS interfere with dirrelc;,-liation (Ferrari et al., Cell Growth Differ. 1:543-548 (1990)).In contrast to the results obtained with lyn, tec or fes, the experiments with Jak2 readily demo"~ r-d an effect on tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of kinase activity and the ability to associate with EPOR. Moreover, the results were quite striking in the specificity for Jak2 relative to Jakl. Jakl and Jak2 are highly related and have considerable amino acid sequence identity in both the catalytic domains as well as the amino terminAl region (Harpur et al., Oncogene 7: 1347-1353 (1992); see also Example 1 herein). The amino acid sequence of Jak2 enr.o-les a protein of 1129 amino acids with a r~lrlllAted size of 130 kDa which has 45.5% identity with the murine Jakl kinase.~lthol-gh there was a clear specificity for Jak2 in our studies, Jakl was CO~ .lly ~et~cted in all assays at low levels. This was not due to cross-reactivity of the A~l;sr~il since all the antisera used were against peptides from regions that do not contain ~ ellS7iVe amino acid identity. In addition the lack of cross-reactivity of the antisera has been established by 95/03701 77 . PCT/USg4/08676 eX~",il~inp the l~acliviLy with in vitro tr~n.cl~t~ rol~ills (see Example 1).The dirre~ ce in ,ea~;livily is also not due to dirrelcnces in the levels of the e~l,lLs~ion of the two kinases, since both are e~lc;ssed at comparable levels. Thel~fole, there ~eal~ to be sufficient similarity between Jakl and Jak2 to allow Jakl to associate with EPOR but with a much lower affinity.EPO induction of Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation was ~s~csed by changes in reactivity with monoclonal antibodies against phospho~yl~sine.Il11~01L~11l1Y, Iy~ hle phosphorylation was readily demonstrable with both the 4G10 and PY20 monoclonal antibodies by Western blotting techniques.In addition, Jak2 could be isolated from EPO stim~ t~ cells, but not from tetl cells, by affinity purification with the lG2 anti-phosphulylosille monoclonal antibody coupled to sepharose. These approaches are commonly used to detect cha~es in protein Lylosille phosphorylation.Our results demo~L,ate that EPO stim~ tion activates the in vitro kinase activity of Jak2 and that the primary substrate is Jak2. Previous studies have found it difficult to demol~Llalt: the kinase activity of Jakl. In particular Wilks et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991) were unable to demollsLIalt: protein lyrosille kinase activity in immnn~lcciL~i~t~s of Jakl under a variety of conditions. However, t_ey were able to demo~LIàle protein tyrosine ph(>srhorylation in ba;t~,.ia wit_ an expression construct cont~inin~ a fusion protein with the carboxyl kinase domain of Jakl. A c~mp~rahle fusion protein co,-~;.;"ii-P the amino l~ l kinase-like ~lom~in had no activity. Illl~ gly, relatively few b~rteri~l ~rol~were phosphorylated, sugge~ lg that Jakl may have a le;,~ cl substrate specifi~ity. Our results would show that the inability to detect in vitro Jakl kinase activity is due to lack of a~ iate activation in vivo since the ability to detect Jak2 kinase activity was absolutely dependent upon stimlll~tion of the cells with EPO. In this regard, we have been unable to demo~ ale Jakl in vitro kinase activity although Jakl ap~cal~ to weakly WO 9S/03701 ~,~ 6~g`- ~ PCT/US94/08676 associate with EPOR and is weakly tyrosine phosphorylated following EPOstim~ tion.The plhllaly substrate of tyrosine phosphorylation in the in vitro reactions was Jak2 and specifically no phosphorylation of the S         i~ )globulin heavy chain was ~letect~ This shows that Jak2 may have very specific substrate specificities. Regarding the m~çh~ i--- of Jak2 activation, it is possible that ligand binding promotes Jak2 ~csoci~tion such that intermolecular phosphorylations occur and result in the activation of kinase activity. Activated Jak2 then has the ability to continue such interrnolecular phosphorylations in vitro in immlln()~reeipi~l~;s in a manner that is completely analogous to the receptor protein tyrosine kinases (Ohtsuka et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 10:1664-1671 (1990); Yarden and Sr1~ s!~ cL~ Biochemistry 26:1434-1442 (1987)).EPO stimlll~tion results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the EPOR receptor with kin~tir~s that are comparable to that of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. This inr1i~te~ that Jak2 is the kinase that is responsible for the EPOR phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of EPORoccurs in the membrane distal carboxyl domain, a region that is not required for mitogenesis. This phosphorylation does not occur in ~co--l;~ i--g a 20 amino acid deletion in the membrane proximal region or with the W282 to R mutation in this region. Since both of these mutations also affect Jak2 phosphorylation and kinase activation and the amino acid del~otion ~ s the ability of Jak2 to ~.c.coci~t~ with EPOR in vitro, it is likely that Jak2 is the kinase responsible for EPOR phosphorylation.~ lively, another kinase may ~ccoci~t~ with Jak2 and thereby be brought into the region of the receptor. If so this additional kinase may also be required for the phosphorylation of Jak2.With the exception of Jak2 and EPOR, relatively little is known concerning the substrates of EPO in~ cecl ~yrosille phosphorylation.S..  I.~ ;s of 92 kDa, 70 kDa and 55 kDa have been consisLe;llLly letect~l in our studies (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:4895-4902 (1991)) and 95/03701 6~098 PCT/US94/08676 others have id.ontifi~ similar as well as additional substrates (Damen et al., Blood 80:1923-1932 (1992); Quelle and Wojchowski, J. Biol. Chem.266:609-614 (1991); Quelle et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:17055-17060 Y            (1992); I,inn~l~in et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6237-6241 (1992);Dus~l~,r-Fourt et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 10670-10675 (1992)). It is also hll~olkull to note that there are readily lPtçct~hle suhstr~t~s of inducible Iy~osille phosphorylation of 55 and 70 kDa that co-i"""~ o~-~;ci~ le with Jak2. We have excluded a -umbe. of potentially illl~lci.Lin~, ~ubsLl~les inrhldin~ vav, rat, GAP and SHC. However, we have not ç~min-o~l the ISGF3~ ~lo~hls of 113 and 91/84 kDa which may be sub~Lldt~s of the Jak family kinase Tyk2 and which are involved in the INF~x re~pollse (Schindler et al., Science 257:809-813 (1992); Fu, X.Y., CeU 70:323-335 (1992)). ~ ively~ related ~rolei. s may exist that interact with Jak2 which specifir~lly m.o~i~te the ~ cliplional activation of the genes ~soci~ted with the l~ onse to EPO.Previous studies i~entifi~ a 130 kDa phosph~rol~;i" that associates with the EPOR (yo~l,i.,....~ and Lodish, Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:706-715 (1992)). By cross-linking, it was shown to be ~e.coci~te-l with EPORsuggesting the possibility that it was a subunit of a lec~lol complex comparable to the ~B chain of the IL-3 or GM-CSF receptor or the ppl30 chain of the IL-6 c:ceptor. However, unlike these L,r~,lei. s, the pl30 was not N-glycosylated sugge~l ng the it might be a cytosolic protein. The tyrosine phosphorylation of pl30 was demo..~ t~od by ;~ uprt;ci~ilation with an anti-phospholy..,~i..e antibody. However it was not possible to ~ whether tyrosine phosphorylation was inrlllre~ by EPO bec~use of the ~.ocedu.es used to isolate the EPOR/pl30 complex. Il-especlive, the ~-up~llies of the pl30 are consistent with the hypothesis that it is Jak2.Our results demo~L aL~ that Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation and l-,ceplor associalion requires a membrane proximal region that is essenti~l for mitogcl.esis. This was most strikingly illllstr~t~cl by the deletion mutant (PB) and by the W282 to R point mnt~nt, both of which are mitogenically WO95/1~3701 ~,i6S -80- E~cr/us94l08676--inactive and concomit~ntly fail to couple to Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation or activation of kinase activity. However, only the mutant with the 20 amino acid deletion (PB) lost the ability to physically ~e~oci~te with Jak2.It is likely that the point mutation is s~ffirient to disrupt a functional inter~rtion of EPOR and Jak2 in vivo, but does not s -fflriently lower the affinity of the interaction to elimin~tP physical interaction in vitro at high protein coi~ r,.~ lir,ns.Our results show that Jak2 association with EPOR is independent of ligand binding. Th~cÇulc it can be hypothrsi7ed that Jak2 phosphorylation occurs as a con~eq~lenre of chdllges affecting the ,cce,ulor/Jak2 complex.Conciderable evidence supports the hypothesis that EPO binding induces dimer- and oligol"cl~ion of the lccc~lol and that this is critical for receptor function (Watowich et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2140-2144 (1992)). This is ~u~ullcd by the exi.~tenre of a mutant EPOR (Rl99 to C) which results in col~LiluLive activation of the receptor (YO~llillll~a et al., Nature 348:647-649 (1990)). This mutation requires the cy~Lci le conversion and results in the ability to form rli~ -lfirle-linked oligomers in the ~hsenre of ligand (Watowich et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA-         89:2140-2144 (1992)). In cells c~,c~i..    g this mutation, in the absence of EPO, Jak2 kinase is c~ ivcly Ly~sh~e phosphorylated and has in vitro kinase activity. Based on these data, we would further hypothesize that EPO binding causes oligomrri7~tiQn of the EPOR/Jak2 complexes, bringing the kinase molecules in sl~ffiri~nt proximity to result in intrrmolecular ~y~osille phosphorylations. This model is i(ientir-~l to that proposed for several lccc~Lol protein Lylvsine kinases (Ullrich and sçhlessi~geL~ Cell 61:203-212 (1990)).Studies with the IFNcY .cce~Lor have suggested that high affinity binding may require the association of Tyk2 (Finnh~c1l-Kraft et al., Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990)). This possibility also exists for EPOR. In particular, since Jak2 is ubiquitously expressed, the binding ~fflniti-os of the~lor have not been ,nea~u,~d in the absence of Jak2. Moreover, as J~ 95/03701                                   98 pcTluss4lo8676 demolLsLlal~d here, EPOR can functionally associate with Jak2 in fibroblasts. Th~lc;f~.le it will be nPcecs;..~/ to express the receptor in phylogenPti~ ~lly distant cells which do not contain a Jak kinase with s lffi~ nt homology to associate with the lcc~>Lor. Under such conditions, it should be possible to address the role of Jak2 ~inding on the affinity of the f~ct;ylor.Jak family kinases are ubiquitously e2~yl~,ssed (Wilks et al., Mol.Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991); see also Example 1). The.erole it was important to ~lel~ i"~ wh~,LIle~, in fibroblasts, eA~l~ssion of the EPORwas sufficient to couple to activation of tyrosine phosphorylation. As demol~Ll~ted, tyrosine phosphorylation of both EPOR and Jak2 was ~etPcted following EPO stim~ tion. Due to the high background of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the cells used, we were not able to determine whether EPO stim~ tion resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of other cellular ~ub~Ll~les. However, EPO stim~ ti-)n of serum starved cells, does not induce a mitogenic ~onse sugge~Lillg that some components required for coupling ligand binding to cell proliferation are Illi.~cil~p. Al~l~laliv~ly, insufficient receptors may be eAyr~ssed. In contrast, a recent report (W~t~n~be et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13: 1440-1448 (1993)) demo~L,~ted that a reconctit~tPcl GM-CSF ,ccey~or complex in fibroblasts can tr~n~ lre a growth-promoting signal.The membrane proximal region of the EPO leceylor with which Jak2 ~C~oc;~les contains limited seqllPnre similarity with other helllalopoietic growth factor leceylol~ (Murakami et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.~5         Sci. USA 88:11349-11353 (1991)). In all cases ex~min~tl, this region has been shown to be essential for mitogenesis. Thus it will be important to ~le~ ",i,~ wL~lher other members of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor ~uy~,~r~lily ~soci~t~ with Jak2, or possibly another mPmher of the Jak family of kinases. In this regard, we have found that IL-3, GM-CSF and G-CSF also induce the specific tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. It will be WO 95/03701             ;                  PCT/US94/08676 ~ 68`~g~ ~ -82-important to further explore the role of Jak family kinases in the responses to other cytokines including IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6.The ubiquitous e~ ,;,sion of the Jak kinases further in~ tk~ that they may couple ligand binding to mitogenesis with other non-hematopoietic members of the cytokine lcc~lor ~u~clr~llily. It has been recognized that there exists structural relationships in the extrace~ r domains of endocrine growth hormones, the l1elllalopoietic cytokine l~CC~tOl~ and a more distant possible relationship with the ~cceplols for tissue factor and il,l~;lr~l~,ns (Bazan, J.F., Immunol. Tod~y 10:350-354 (1991); Bazan, J.F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:6934-6938 (1990); De Vos et al., Science 255:306-312 (1992)). If these relationships reflect a divergent evolution of a class of sign~ling rcc~lol~, it is possible that they couple signal tr~n~duction in a similar lll~mer through inter~-~tions with lllClll~e.~ of the Jak kinase family. Thus the INF~ lccepl~r couples -    through Tyk2 while the lcc~l~l~ for IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF and EPOcouple through Jak2. Co..~ r~.l with this we have found that IFN~y induces the Iylosille phosphorylation of Jak2 in a macrophage cell line. In addition recent studies have found that the growth hormone l~cceplor binds to and aclivdLt;s Jak2. It will be of considerable interest to identify which of the Jak kinases other ~ lllbel~ of the cytokine receptor ~ulJtlr~llily associate with and activate.It will also be of interest to determink whtLIl,r the Jak family of kinases utilize similar -.kc~ to affect gene regulation. Col~ide~ble evidence suggests that Tyk2 couples INF~ B bhldu~g to tyrosine phosphorylation of the 113 kDa and 91/84 kDa proteins of the ISGF3a~(hlltlrelull-stim~ ted gene factor 3) complex (Fu, X.Y., Cell 70: 323-335 (1992)). Following phosphorylation this complex associates with the 48 kDa ISGF37~ protein and the complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds the i~ lreLoll-stimlll~te~ es~ollse element and activates gene ~ ,ssion. Recent studies (Shuai et al., Science 259: 1808-1812 (1992)) have demo.,~l...le~1 that IFN-y also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the J~! 95/03701 21 68o,,~8 ` PCT/US94/0~676 91 kDa protein, but not of the 113 kDa protein, and that it migrates to the nucleus and binds a y-activated site. As noted above, Jak2 is inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated following IFN y binding and thus may be the kinase involved. If correct, stim~ tion of cells with EPO, IL-3, GM-CSF or G-CSF may result in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 91 kDa ISGF3~protein or a mPmher of this gene family. In this regard it is important to note that one of the major sllbstr~t~s of lylushle phosphorylation seen in rts~ollse to EPO or IL-3 is a protein of approximately 92 kDa (Miura et al., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:48954902 (1991); Miura et al., Mol. Cell. Biol.13:1788-1795 (1993)). From the above, it can by hypothPci7ecl that members of the cytokine receptor ~u~tlr~llily couple ligand binding to in~ cin~ gene e~ s:iion, in part, by the activation of Jak family kinases by autophosphorylation following ligand binding which results in the phosphorylation of members of the ISGF3 y family which, in turn, ~soci~te with members of the ISGF3cY family of DNA binding pl.)leills, including ICSBP, IRF-l, IFR-2 and c-myb (Veals et al., Mol.

Here we identify Jak2, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, as a GHR-associated tyrosine kinase.Tmmllnological approaches were used to establish GH-dependent complex formation between Jak2 and GHR, activation of Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of both Jak2 and GHR. The Jak2-GHR and Jak2-elyLlll~J~oietin receptor interactions described here and in the acco-ll~allyillg Example 2 provide a molecular basis for the role of tyrosyl phosphorylation in physiological .es~ollses to these lig~n-l~, thus evi~t~nring shared ~ip;n~lin~m~ch~ni~m among members of the cytokine/hematopoietin l~,c~Lor family.           Intro~ io. Although the ability of growth hormone (GH) to promote growth and regulate metabolism has been known for many years (Cheek, D.B. and Hill, D.E., "Effect of growth hormone on cell and somatic growth, " in E. Knobli -           and W.H. Sawyer, eds., Handbook of Physiology, Vol. 4:159-185, Washington, DC (1974); Davidson, M.B., Rev. 8:115-131 (1987)), the molecular m~ch~ ... by which GH bil~dillg to its receptor elicits its diverse responses has rem~in~(l an enigm~ New insight into GH ~ign~ling m~çl~ was lecel,Ily provided by the fl~mon~tration that a Iy,~si"e kinase activity is present in a complex with GH receptor (GHR) plepaled from GH-Wo 95/03701 ~                                  PCT/US94/08676 --treated fibroblasts (Carter-Su., C. etal., J. Biol. Chem. 264:18654-18661 (1989); Stred, S.E. etal., Endocrinol. 130:1626-1636 (1992); Wang, X.et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267: 17390-17396 (1992)). Additional studies in 3T3-F442A cells showing rapid GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of multiple yro~ s~ tyrosyl phospht~rylation of microtubule-associated protein kinases, and stim~ tiQn of microtubule-associated protein kinase activity, as well as the inhibition of these actions by inhibitors of the GHR-associated tyrosine kinase (Campbell, G.S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993)), suggest a central role for a GHR-~oci~t~i tyrosine kinase in sign~lin~ by GH.Recently, a nonrec~lor tyrosyl phosphorylated 122 kd protein was id~ntified in a kinase-active GH-GHR ~lepdla~ion (Wang, X. et al., J. Biol. Chem.268:3573-3579 (1993)). Since autophosphorylation is often a .llanir~L~tion of an activated kinase, it was hypothPsi7~cl that this 121 kd phosphopro~ is the GHR-associated kinase.In this study, we identify Jak2, a 130 kd Iy,osi,le kinase (Harpur, A.G.et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1553 (1992)) as a GHR-associated kinase. Jak2 is a member of the l~celllly described Janus family of Iylosille kinases in~l~l(lin~Jakl, Jak2, and Tyk2. In addition to having a kinase domain, these proteills are ch~r~rterized by the plcsellce of a second kinase-like domain and the ~hs-on~e of Src homology 2 (SH2), SH3, and membrane-~y~ domains (WiLks, A.F. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991); Firmh~rh-Kraft, I. etal., Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990); Harpur, A.G. etal., Oncogene 7:1347-1553 (1992)).Here we show that GH binding promotes a~soci~tion of Jak2 with GHR, activation of Jak2, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of both Jak2 and GHR.-            The i~ ir,~s~lion of Jak2 as a si~n~ling molecule early in the GHR signal tr~n~d~l~tion p~Lllw~y provides important insight into ~i~n~ling by GHR and into the function of Jak2. Work ~lesellled in the accolllyclllyillg Example 2 in-lir~t~s that Jak2 also associates with the lec~Lor for elyLllluyoietin (EPO),and other data intlif ~t~ that at least four other members of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor family (receptors for interleukin [IL]-3), ~ 95103701 ~/ ?~ ~ ~ PCT/USg4/08676 granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimnl~ting factor [GM-CSF], granulocyte colony-stimlll~ting factor [G-CSF], and prolactin) and the more distantly related IFN- y ~ce~)tur activate Jak2 (see acco~ allying Examples). It therefore seems likely that the Jak2-GHR and Jak2-EPO l'eC~)101 interactions S shown herein serve as protoly~es for ~i~n~lin~ through many m~mhers of this large lcc~tor ~u~tlr~nily.           Results GH,St~tnul~fes Tyrosyl Phosphoryla~on of Jak2 On the basis of previous studies establishing the existence of a GHR-associated tyrosine kinase (Carter-Su., C. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:18654-18661 (1989); Stred, S.E. et al., Endocrinol. 130: 1626-1636 (1992); Wang, X. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:3573-3579 (1993); Campbell, G.S. et al., J.Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993)), the GHR-associated tyrosine kinase would be expected; first, to be a protein of ~ 120 kd; second, to be tyrosyl phosphQrylated in response to GH; third, to be present in a complex with GHR; and fourth, to exhibit increased activity in re~o lse to GH.Jak2 is a tyrosine kinase of the correct size (Mr of ~ 130,000; see example 1) to be the GHR-associaL~d kinase and was Ll~ folc tested for its ability to be phosphorylated in response to GH. Solubilized proteins from GH-treated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were immlmnpreci~iL~l~d using antiserum to Jak2 (aJak2) and analyzed by anti-phosph~Ly.vsine antibody (aPY) immnnoblot. Cells were inrllhattod with varying physiological collce-lL-dlions of GH in ~gillg in 10-fold increments from 0.5 ng/ml to 500 ng/ml (the standard co,-r~ Qn used) for 0, 0.5, 5, 50, and 60 mimlt~s.2~   GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of a protein with an Mr (~ 130,000) ~r~,p.iale for Jak2 was clearly evident at times as early as 30 seconds and at physiological co,~r~ ions of GH as low as 5.0 ng/ml (230 pM). Phosphorylation was ~  , being greatly ~limini~hP~l by 60 min after Wo 95/03701 ~ PCT/US94/08676 addition of GH. The 130 kd phosphoproLt;ill was d~t~ctPcl in ~xPYimmlm~blasts of cYJak2 immlln~preei~ilales. The ~pea-dnce of this 130 kd protein corresponded in time course and GH dose response with the appearance in whole-cell Iysates of a tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein ~esign~t~d ppl21 in previous work (Campbell, G.S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993), Wang, X. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:3573-3579 (1993)). The identity of these two proteills is suggested by their co-migration in cell Iysates of tyrosyl phosphorylated ppl21 and Jak2 and depletion of tyrosyl-phosphorylated ppl21 from cell lysates following immlln~precipitation with cYJak2.The 130 kd phosphoproLeill was p,~ci~iLaled specifically by aJak2.Non-immlln~ serum, an unrelated immlln~ serum (~G-LUT-l), and aJak2 preadsorbed with the peptide used to make the antibody failed to U)pl~;cipitate ppl30. Preadsorption of a~Jak2 with the analogous peptide from murine Jakl (see Example 1) did not i"l~rt;,~ with ~eci~ Iion of the 130 kd phosphoproleill by cYJak2. In contrast with these results using cxJak2, immllnoprecipitation of 3T3-F442A and IM-9 cell lysates, ,c~eclively~with antibodies specific for Jakl (aJakl) and Tyk2 (c~Tyk2) revealed little (aJakl) or no (c~Tyk2) GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of a ~ 130 kd protein, despite the ~rt;sellce of these kinases in the ,c;~e~ re cell types.Tyrosyl phosphorylation of the 130 kd protein p,~ ci~i~led from 3T3-F442A cells by ~xJak2 was increased specirlcally by GH. Phosphorylation was not increased by platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor 1. These growth factors stimlll~te ~y~o~i~le kinase activity intrin.cic to their ,ec~lo,~ (Ulrich, A. and Srhl~c~ er, J., Cell 61:203-212 (1990)) and promote tyrosyl phosphorylation of multiple prolei,ls in 3T3-F442A fibroblasts (Campbell, G.S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993)). The inability to stim~ te Jak2 tyrosyl phosphorylation is con.ci~terlt with the previously reported inability of these growth factors to stimlll~te tyrosyl phosphorylation of ppl21 in whole-cell lysates (Campbell, G.S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993)).            vl~s/03701 9S PcTluss4lo8676 Jak2 Associates with the GH Receptor To delt~ whether Jak2 forms a complex with GHR, GH-GHR-                complexes and associated ploLehls were immnn~ cci~iLaled from solubilized, GH-treated 3T3-F442A fibroblasts using antibody to GH (aGH). The S           ~lcsellce of Jak2 in aGH jmmllnnprc~ tes was ~ses~e~ either by immnnoblotting with aJak2 or by ;~ opleci~iL~ting with aJak2 and imml-noblotting with aPY. When material ~lc~ iLatcd using aGH was analyzed, aJak2 was found to immunoblot a 130 kd protein and to immnnoprecipitate a tyrosyl-phosphorylated 130 kd protein that co-migrates with a protein recognized by aJak2, inrlir~ting that Jak2 associates with GH-GHR complexes. When instead of aGH, the initial immlmoprecipitation was ~ ro~ ed with antibody to either the cytoplasmic or extracellular ~lom~in~ of GHR (~xGHR), aJak2 recognized a 130 kd protein only when cells had been incubated with GH. Con~i~te~t with the ~le~cnce of Jak2 in the aGHR ~rcci~iL~le because of its association with GH-bound GHR, no signal was ~letçcte~l in aJak2 immlmoblots of ~GH immllno~cci~iL~Les when cells had not been inrllb~tPd with GH nor when immllnoprecipitation was performed using an unrelated i.,..     ,-t serum (aGLUT-1). These results provide evidence that GH bil1dillg to its ~cce~Lol is n~ce~s~ry to the formation of a complex bcLwcen GHR and Jak2.In addition to the 130 kd phosphoploLeh~ believed to be Jak2, a diffusely mi~r~tin~ phospho~loLeill of ~ 120 kd idçntifie-1 by o~PY ;.-..    -oblot was ~l~ci~iL~Led by aGH, aGHR, and to a lesser extent by aJak2. Col~ cllt with this diffuse band being GHR, its size col-c~nds to that previously reported for GHR in these cells (Schwartz, J. and Carter-Su, C., Endocrinology 122:2247-2256 (1988); Stred, S.E. et al., Endocrinol.130: 1626-1636 (1992)), and it co-migrates with a simil~rly diffuse ~ 120 kd band id~ntifilo~l by aGHR in Western blots of aGH immnn~leci~iL~tcs.

Additional evidence that both Jak2 and GHR are tyrosyl phosphorylated in response to GH is provided by the finding that in a lldlL~rt;cL~d Chinese h~llslel ovary cell line (CHO4) that e~fesses a smaller (84 kd) GHR (Eminer, M. et al., Mol. Endocrinol.4:2014-2020 (1990); Wang, X. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:3573-3579 (1993)), tyrosyl phosphorylation of a 130 kd protein in aGH, o~GHR, and cYJak2 immllnopreci~iLalt;S and a diffusely migrAting 84 kd protein in cYGH and cYGHR i~ ecipiL~les is GH depe~-1Pnt .~n~ on by GH of Jak Kinase Activity Previous studies have established that when cYGH ~ ,iL~tes are ~,eyared from GH-treated CHO4 cells, the addition of ATP results in the tyrosyl phosphorylation of both a 130 kd and a 84 kd protein (Wang, X.et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:3573-3579 (1993)). To d~ P whether the 130 kd and 84 kd prolt;ills phosphorylated in this in vitro kinase assay are Jak2 and GHR, l~,~eclively, GH-GHR complexes and ~oci~trd pluLeills were ple~,iyiL~led from GH-treated and control CHO4 cells using cYGH, inrllb~t~P-l with [~y-32P]ATP, dissociated by boiling in buffer cont~ining SDS, ,~-ml_r~d~lueth~n-l, and dithiothreitol (DTT), and re-~leci~iL~Lt;d using eithercYJak2 or ~GHR. In this e~.".lellL aJak2 was able to ~ ildLe a 130 kd 32P-labeled protein a~f~liate for Jak2, and ~xGHR was able to precipitate an 84 kd 32P-labeled protein appr~liaLe for GHR, inrliratin~ that both Jak2 and GHR incol~olale 32p in the in vitro kinase assay.To verify that Jak2 functions as a GH-dependent Ly,osi le kinase, Jak2 was purified from GH-treated and control 3T3-F442A cells either by direct ci~iLaLion with aJak2 or, to permit a higher degree of purifir~tion, by se~ e~ iL~lion using c~PY followed by cYJak2. When the cYJak2 ;Illllllll~t? complexes were inr~lb~ted with [7~-32P]ATP. 32P-labeled plVlei IS mi~r~tin~ with a Mr (130,000) ~lu~liaL~ for Jak2 were d~otrctrd ~95/03701 216~9 PCT/US94/08676 only when the cells had been inrllb~te~1 with GH, inrlic~tin~ an exquisite se~ ily of Jak2 to activation by GH~ To verify that Jak2 incorporates phosphate into tyrosyl residues, phospho~minn acid analysis was performed on the 32P-labeled 130 kd protein isolated from GH-treated 3T3-F442A cells.32p was found incorporated almost exclusively into tyrosyl residues, con~i~tçnt with Jak2 being a GH-sensitive Iy~osine kinase. However, the incorporation of a small amount of 32p (under 1%) into threonine residues in the aJak2 c~ itate leaves open the possibility that Jak2 is a mixed function threonine/serine/tyrosine kinase.              Discu~;en Idenhfication of Jak2 As a Signaling Molecule for GHR The identifir~ti-~n of Jak2 as a GH-dependent, GHR-associated tyrosine kinase has important implir~ti~n~ for signal tr~n~lurtion by both GHR and Jak2. With regard to GHR, Jak2 is i~lentifiecl as a sign~ling molecule that interacts with GHR and is activated in response to GH binding. Its sensitivity to GH and rapid onset following GH addition make tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak2 among the most sensitive and rapid responses known for GH;activation of Jak2 is an initi~ting step for GH signal tr~n.~ch-~tion.Tyrosine kinases have been shown to elicit responses similar to those attributable to GH, including metabolic responses (e.g., insulin receptor) and dirr~ ialion (e.g., nerve growth factor rec~Lor) (reviewed by Davidson, M.B., Rev. 8:115-131 (1987); Isaksson, O.G.P. et al., Endocrinol.Rev. 8:426-438 (1987); Levi-Montaicini, R., Science 237:1154-1162 (1987);Kaplan, D.R. et al., Science 252:554-558 (1991)). Therefore, Jak2 plays a vital role in eliciting the known responses to GH. Con~i~nt with this, no biological functions, other than binding of GH, have been reported for GHRe~ ssed in cells that have low levels of GHR-associated Lyloshle kinase activity (e.g., COS-7 and mouse L cells; Leung, D.W. et al., Nature Wo 95/03701 ~ - PCT/US94/08676 --~6~ 94-330:537-543 (1987); Wang, X. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:17390-17396 (1992)). In contrast, a variety of biological functions (e.g., insulin synthesisin RIN5-AH cells and protein synthesis, microtubule-associated protein kinase activity, c-fos gene exylession~ and lipid synthesis in Chinese 11A~ I ovary S         cells) can be activated by GH binding when the cloned liver GHR is e~ c;ssed in cells that have reasonably high levels of GHR-associated kinase activity (Bitlestrup, N. etal., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:7210-7214 (1990);Eminer, M. et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 4:2014-2020 (1990); Moller, C., in Aspects of the Mechanism of Growth Hormone Action, Ph.D. Thesis, Karolinska Tn~tit~lte, NO-VUM, ~~ inge, Sweden (1992), pp. 1-9; Wang, X. e~ al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:17390-17396 (1992); Moller, C. et al., J. Biol.Chem. 267:23403-23408 (1992)).FulLh~lnlore, in 3T3-F442A cells, multiple plolei~ls exhibit GH-dependent increases in tyrosyl phosphorylation. Consi~ with activation of Jak2 being required for these phosphorylations, tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak2/ppl21 is simllltAnPous with or precedes tyrosyl phosphorylation of all the ~roLeins exhibiting GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation, at all GHco~ lldtions tested (this work and Campbell, G.S. et al., J. Biol. Chem.268:7427-7434 (1993)).Jak2 serves as a ~ignAling molecule for GHR by phosphorylating other proteil~s. Two proteins have been icleIltifi~d as substrates of Jak2: Jak2 itself and GHR.Studies using ll~ AIrd GHR inrlirAt~ that in the cytoplasmic domain of the GHR, at least 1 of the 4 tyrosyl residues most proximal to the ~lelllbl_lle is phosphorylated in response to GH. Studies are underway to identify which of the 4 tyrosines are phosphorylated by Jak2, as well as to identify ly~ les in the C-terminal portion of GHR that might also be phosphorylated. It is important to d~le-lllilu, the identity and number of lyl~sil~es phosphorylated in Jak2 and GHR, because these sites are likely to be binding sites for SH2-contAining ~vleins (e.g., phospholipase C- y, p85 phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and GTPase-acLiv~thlg protein; Koch, A.A.        Jl~ 95/03701 ~ 6~a~ PCT/US94/08676 et al., Science 252:668-674 (1991)) in intercellular .cign~ling pathways.Sign~ling pathways involving SH2-cont~ining plOlt~illS that bind to phosphorylated Jak2 would be expected to be shared by all ligands that -             activate Jak2, whereas SH2-co~ proleills that bind to phosphorylated tyrosyl residues in GHR could provide specificity to a si~n~lin~ mlorh~nicm that utilizes a kinase (i.e., Jak2) with the ap~alc"~ capacity to service more than one receptor (see below).Jak2 has also been shown to be activated following the binding of EPOto its ,eceptol (Example 2). Other data in-lir~te that IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, IFN-7~, and prolactin also activate Jak2 ( see Example 1). Thus, Jak2 serves as a kinase for multiple members of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor family. Since each ligand elicits a separate co~ctell~tion of responses, kinase activation alone cannot account for specificity. As mentioned above, a set of responses dependent upon phosphorylation of the rec~l(,l could provide the specificity. Additionally, specificity could be obtained by interaction between multiple cign~ljng patl,way~ or by the expression of only one receptor type in a particular cell type. This latter mechanism is suggested by the ability of GH, G-CSF, and EPO to stimulate proliferation of IL-3-dependent cells L,al~recl~d with the cDNA from the a~p,u~liadle receptor (F lh-n~, R. et al., EMBO J. 10:2855-2865 (1991); Tchi7~k~-Ikeda, E. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA 90:123-127 (1993); Yoshimura, A. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U~ 87:41394143 (1990)).The commonality of Jak2 activation suggests that there will be shared pathways activated by the ligands that bind Jak2-coupled receptors. Of particular interest for gaining insight into regulation of gene transcription byGH is a lJ~Lhw~y initi~ted by IFN- y. In response to IFN-~y, the 91 kd protein of the ISGF-3 (IFN-stim~ ted gene factor 3) complex undergoes tyrosyl phosphorylation and then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to DNAat the ~y-activated site (Shuai, K. etal., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992)).Tcl~ iril ~lion of the 90 kd protein phosphorylated in response to GH(Campbell, G.S. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7427-7434 (1993)) as the 91 kd WO 95/03701 5~ -96- PCT/US94/08676 protei~ of the ISGF-3 complex or a family member would implicate one pathway by which GH might elicit some of the effects on gene Llallscli~Lion.   Achvation of Jak2 by GH The exact meçh~nicm by which GH activates Jak2 is not yet known.Earlier studies using an exogenous substrate (poly Glu, Tyr) established that more Iylosi~le kinase activity is present in a complex with GHR when GHRis prepared from GH-treated cells than from control cells (Stred, S.E. et al., Endocrinol. 130:1626-1636 (1992)). The present study shows that this GH-in~ ced increase in kinase activity results from both an increase in affinity ofGHR for Jak2 and an increase in Jak2 activity. Jak2 appears to bind directly to GHR, since only two ploL~ills, migrating with sizes a~propliàte for Jak2 and GHR, are vicl~li7~d when highly purified kinase-active GH-GHRcomplexes are isolated from GH-treated 35S-labeled 3T3-F442A fibroblasts by sequential immlmoprecipitation using c~PY and then either o~GHR or ~GH(Stred, S.E. et al., Endocrinol. 130:1626-1636 (1992)). The m.och~nicm by which GH promotes association of Jak2 with GHR and Jak2 activation is likely to require dimerization of GHR, since GH-in~ ced tyrosyl phosphorylation of cellular proteills appears to require dillltl~lion of GHR(Silvâ, C.M. et al., Endocrinol. 32:101-108 (1993)). An important role for receptor dimerization in si~n~ling via Jak2 is further suggested by work relating Jak2 activation to EPO lcc~lol dilllel~a~ion ~licc~lsced in Example 2.The results reported herein provide evidence that binding of GH by GHR results in the formation of a ligand-bound GHR dimer capable of binding Jak2. Recruitment of Jak2 leads to the formation of a GH-GHR-Jak2 complex, stim~ tion of Jak2 tyrosine kinase activity, and tyrosyl phosphorylation of Jak2, GHR, and p-c~ulllably other ~rolt~ s. Whether acliv~l~d Jak2 is present only in a complex with GHR or can dissociate from -               GHR and phosphorylate pr~leills that are physically distant from GHR is ~;ullclllly being investig~ted Also under investi~~tinn is the possibility that ~ 95/03701 21 6~D 9~ PCT/US94/08676 GHR can form complexes with kinases other than, or in addition to, Jak2.Obvious c~n~ te kinases include other members of the Jak family. In 3T3-F442A and IM-9 cells"~l,e~;Li.rely, Jakl and Tyk2 do not appear to associate -            with GHR to the same extent as Jak2. However, they or other as yet llni-ientifiled Jak kinases may do so in other cell types or under different physiological conditions.In ~ .y, the e~ ents p~esenLed here, in combination with the similar ~lntling~ for the EPO receptor presented in Example 2 and other r~ct~tol~, for IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, prolactin, and IFNJy (see Example 1), inflic~te that the activation of Jak2 kinase activity by GH and EPO by a "~Pr~ "~ involving a Jak2-receptor complex is a prototype for si~n~ling by many members of the cytokine/hematopoietin family receptors. The finding that GHR shares an important and early sign~ling molecule with other members of the cytokine/hematopoietin receptor family shows that GH, IL-3, EPO, prolactin, GM-CSF, G-CSF and IFN-~ are likely to share some sign~ling pathways. However, specificity could still be achieved, since phosphorylation of each r~c~Lol offers ~i~n~ling capabilities unique to each ligand. The variable expression of individual receptors, the potential presence of only a subset of all possible ,cign~ling pathways in dirrc.~ cell types, and regulation of the ~ign~ling molecules in these paLllw~y~, by other stimuli pellniLs an additional level of specificity. This finding is likely to lead to the idel.lir~ lion of new actions for GH as well as for these other cytokines.

Rev. Biochem.56:727-777 (1987)). There are three major antigenic types of human IFN:         95/03701 21 68a98 PCT/US94/08676 alpha (~), beta (,B) and gamma ( y). Gene induction by IFNs-a~ and IFN- y is through sepalate l~ceplol~. The existence of a minor IFN-,l~ specific LecepLor cannot be exch~le~l (Pellegrini, S., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:4605-4612 (1989)) and the multiplicity of IFN-ol subtypes shows that the interaction S         of these with the IFN-o~B .cce~tol(s) is likely to be complex.The isolation of ~ ; affecting both the IFN-a~ and the IFN-~y signal tr~n~ ction pathways has intlir~t~l that common factors are involved (John, J., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:4189-4195 (1991); McKen~lry~ R., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:11455-11459 (1991)). One such factor (p91, below and Example 4) has recently been identified (Schin~ller, C., et al., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992); Shuai, K., etal., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992)). IFN-binding components have been cloned for both major receptors (Aguet, M., et al., Cell S5:273-280 (1988); Uze, G., et al., Cell 60:225-234 (1990)). Signal tr~n.cd~ction subunits have yet to be isolated, but the p48, p84, p91 and pl 13 polypeptide co~ o~ of the ~ lal.y transcription factor ISGF3, activated in response to IFNs-~x and -,B, have been cloned and cha~a.;lel~d (Veals, S.A., etal., Mol. Cell. Biol. 12:3315-3324 (1992);Schindler, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7836-7839 (1992);Schindler, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:7840-7843 (1992)).There is rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine of p91, p84 and pl 13 in response to IFN-cY and of p91 and p84 in response to IFN- y (Shuai, K., et al., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992)). In addition, comple...~  tion of mutant UlA (11.1) which was isolated from cells e~l~,ssing a drug-selectable marker under the control of the predo~ ull~ly IFN-a~-responsive 6-16 gene promoter, has revealed a role for the protein tyrosine kinase Tyk2 in the IFN-~ response pal~lwày (Vel~ 7., L., etal., Cell 70:313-322 (1992)). Here, using an iv~ selection technique, complem~-nt~tion of a mutant in the IFN~y response by Jak2, another member of the same family of protein tyrosine kinases (WiLks, A.F., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991); Harpur, A.G., et al., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992); Firmb~ch-Kraft, I., et al., Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990); Example 1), is reported.      Wo 95/03701 ~ 104- PCT/US94/08676--Results The 9-27 gene promoter is inducible by IFN- y as well as IFNs-~ and -,B (Reid, L.E., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA ~6:840-844 (1989)).Signifir~nt constitutive expression from this promoter precluded a drug selection protocol. Accordingly a clone of cells (2C4) expressing the simple cell-surface marker CD2 (normally ex~l~;ssed only on T-cells) under the control of the 9-27 promoter was derived and the fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) used to screen for loss or gain of IFN- y inducibility. IFN-inducible expression of endogenous Class I and II HLAs was also monitored.In 2C4 cells good induction of all three antigens by IFN- y and of CD2 and Class I by IFN-~ was observed.Mutant~y-1 was isolated by mutagenesis of 2C4 and several rounds of sorting. To enhance the isolation of trans rather than cis mllt~ntc and of ",."~ in the plilnal.y rather than secondary IFN-~y response pathways, the final two sorts were on both CD2 and Class I. Mutant ~-1 is defective in the response to IPN-~y but not to IFN-~ or IFN-,B. Transfection of this mutant with a murine Jak2 e~lession construction (Example 1), however, restored the IFN-~y response of all three cell surface markers in an enriched population and clones of transfectants. Transfection with murine Jakl, in the same construct, was without effect.The ~ ssion of a spectrum of IFN-~y-inducible mRNAs was also monitored by RNase protection. For all eight IFN-inducible mRNAs tested the positive IFN-(x response (minim~l for IRF1 and GBP) was the same for 2C4, mutant ~y-1 and the y-1/Jak2 transfectants, whereas for IFN~y the response observed in 2C4 was lost in ~y-1 but restored in the ~y-1/Jak2 transfectants. A gamma activation sequence (GAS) motif has l~cellLly been identified as me~ ting the primary IFN-y response of the GBP and ITF1 genes through p91 (see Example 1; Decker, T., et al., EMBO J. 10:927-932 (1991), Kanno, Y., et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:3951-3963 (1993)). The DNAelements and/or factors governing the pLilllal,y IFN~y response of the ~ 95/03701 21~80 PCT/US94/08676 -105~ rem~in~er of the genes tested have yet to be rigorously established. The fact, however, that all of the genes tested are affected is consi~lelll with the defect in mutant ~y-1 being in the primary IFN-?~ response pathway.In all cases the IFN-~ response was restored by Jak2 and the IFN~y dose response curves for the wild-type 2C4 and y-1/Jak2 transfectants were esse"l ;~lly i~lentir~l: a clear response was seen at 10 IU/ml and an appro~ ing m~xim~l response at 100 IU/ml. No restoration of IFN-y response was observed on transfection of ~y-l cells with a functional Tyk2 expression clone and, in an inverse e~el unent, Jak2 did not complement the defect in Tyk2 in a Ul mutant.The defect in mutant ~y-l cells does not reflect the absence of Jak2 protein since levels colllpal~ble to wild-type were observed on we~Çel as was the case for Jakl and Tyk2. The anti-peptide antibody used to illl.llunopl~cipitate Jak2 and to probe the w~sLt;lll transfer was cle~ignlo~l to distinguish between Jakl and Jak2 and has high specificity for Jak2 (see Examples 1-2). The mutation in y-l may, therefore, reflect point or other minor mutations affecting the function but not the production of Jak2.~ltern~tively, the m-lt~tion could be in an up~Llc:alll component which, once mllt~tecl, fails to interact productively with normal levels of endogenous human Jak2, but is rescued by high levels (see Example S) of the transfected murine Jak2.It will require substantial additional work before one can be certain of the precise nature of the mutation involved. The defect in mutant y-l is, however, without any appar~.lt major effect on the biding of IFN-~y to its lc;cel~tor. Essentially i(l~ntir~l binding was reproducibly observed with wild-type 2C4 and mutant ~y-l cells. This is in contrast to the situation with mutantUlA (originally coded 11.1) in which the defect in Tyk2 results in loss of high affinity lecep~.r binding for IFN-o~ (Pellegrini, S., et al., Mol. CeU.Biol. 9:4605-4612 (1989)). It will be of interest to determine whether this dirr~ ce reflects the absence of Tyk2 but not Jak2 protein in UlA and ~y-l r~eclively, or a more fi~nrl~mental difference in the pre~ ive interaction WO 95/03701        ?,~.6o       -106-                  PCT/US94/08676 of the two kinases with their le~ecli~e receptor complexes. The Jak2 protein, like Tyk2, does not appear to be signi~lc~ntly inrluce(l in response toIFNs ~y or -~ in the wild-type cells.          Dis~ n Here it is shown that a mutant human cell line, defective in the IFN- y ollse of all genes tested, is complemP.n~d by murine Jak2. Example 5 shows: (1) direct evidence that the defect in mutant ~y-1 is early in the y~ al y response ~)al~lW~; (2) that Jak2 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IFN-~; and (3) results consistent with the rapid activation and (auto)phosphorylation of Jak2 in response to IFN-y in wild-type but not mutant cells.Irrespective of the precise nature of the mutation in y-1, these data intlic~te an ess~ role for Jak2 in the ~ llaly IFN-7~ response. The availability of antibody to Jak2 and of .,..,l~ in additional complementation groups in the IFN- y response pathway should prove invaluable in ~ e~ ",;";i~g the number and nature of the co-llp~l~elll~ involved in this response.

Data was genPr~t~ocl for an enriched population and a clone of y-1/Jak2 transfectants using FACSCAN (BECTON DICKINSON) analyses (3000 data points, Consort 30). Cells were plated at 5 x 105/10 cm dish and treated the following day with 103 IU/ml of a highly purified ~ lule of c~-IFNs (WELLFERON 1.5 x 108 IU/mg protein, kindly supplied by WELLCOME RESEARCH LABORATORIES, Beckenh~m, UK) or recombinant human IFN-~ (4 x 107 IU/mg protein, obtained from Dr. Gunter 95/03701 j ~ 809~ PCT/US94/08676 Adolf, Ernst Boehringer Institut fur Al,llei~ lelfolschullg, Vienna, Austria, and c~ llel-;ially or readily available).Cells (106) were stained for 30 min at 0C with R-phycot;ly~llh~--            conjugated murine monoclonal antibody to human CD2 (DAKO-CD2 MT910,DAKO A/S Denmark) or HLA DRA (clone L243, Becton Dickinson), or FITC-conjugated murine monoclonal antibody to human HLA ABC (shared ~l~L~I ...i"~nt, clone W6/32, SERALAB, UK) and fixed in 1 %paraform~ yde. Clone 2C4 was derived by stable co-transfection of human HT1080 cells with pDW9-27CD2 and pTKNco and FACSCAN analysis of G418-resistant clones. pDW9-27D2 is a mo~lifir~tion of PJ3Omega (Morgaenstern, J.P. et al., Nucl.

USA86:840-844 (1989)) and which carries a full length CD2 cDNA (Sewel, W.A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:8718-8722 (1986)) in the EcoRI site of the polylinker.Mutagenesis (~lve rounds) with ICRl91 was as previously described (McKent11y, R., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:11455-11459 (1991)).Cells not responsive to IFN~y were "selected" using a FACSTAR Plus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). 5 x 107 mutagenized cells were treated with 500 IU/ml of recombinant human IFN-~ for 48 h, resuspended and stained with phycoclyll~ conjugated antibody to CD2 and (in the last two sorts) FITC-conjugated antibody to HLA Class I (above) and sorted imm~ t~ly. The bottom 5 % of fluort;scillg cells were collected.After six rounds of sorting clone ~y-1 was isolated by limiting dilution of the enriched population. It showed a novel IFN-~ a+-,~ phenotype distinct from other IFN-y ~ previously described (Loh, J.E., et al., EMBO J. 11:1351-1363 (1992); Mao, C., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The ~urolllycin-resi~Ldlll population of stable tran~reclallL~ were treated with recombinant IFN~y, FACSsorted and the top 7 % of responder cells were collected and analyzed. Clones of ~y-1/Jak2 L ~re~;L~d cells, obtained by limitinp dilution of the enriched population, were also analyzed, for which full ~ Luldtion of the IFN-~y response was observed.IFN-inslu~ihle gene ~Al,res~ion in wild type 2C4, ~ 1 and ~ 1/Jak2 transfected cells: mRNA expression in response to IFNs-~x or -~y was monitored by RNase protection using probes to detect the IFN-inducible mRNAs of: the 9-27, 6-16, 2-5A synthPt~e and ISGF3 y genes and the p91 and p84 alternatively spliced products of the p91/84 ISGF3~x gene and the IRF1 and GBP genes. The protection of ~y-actin mRNA served as an internal loading control. Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from monolayer cells by NP40 lysis and phenol/chloroform extraction (Porter, A.C.G., et al., EMBO J. 7:85-92 (1988)). RNase protection was with RNA probes labeled with 32p UTP to 2-5 x 108 cpm/~4g of input DNA (Melton, D.A., et al., Nucl.Acids Res. 12:7035-7056 (1984)). One to 3 x 105 cpm of each probe and 10 ,ug of RNA were used in each assay.Expression of Jak2 in wild-type 2C4, ~      -1 cells and ~ ..t ~-1 cells transfected with murine Jak2 (~y-lJak2tr): Jak2 protein was ;"~",l~" plt;ci~iLdl~d from precleared whole cell extracts (107 cells) with antiserum to Jak2 (Example 1) and protein A SEPHAROSE (PHARMACIA;John, J., et al., Mol.

For the mutant ~y-1 cell extracts illlllllli~)pl~cipitation was carried out in the absence (no peptide) or pLesence (30 ~g/ml) of the Jak2 peptide to which the antiserum was raised (Jak2 pept) or, as a non-specific control, an unrelated Jakl peptide (Jakl).            95/03701 ~0~ PCT/US94/08676 Rinrlin~ of l25I-labeled I~ to 2C4 and ~ y-1 cells: l25I-IFN-~y (667 Ci/mMole, Amcl~halll International, UK) L,cdLIllcnt was of triplicate samples of 106 cells for 90 min at 0C. Non-specific binding was -         subtracted. It was d~le~ ed in parallel in the presence of a 200 fold excess of unlabeled IFN-~y and represented approximately 40% of the total radioactivity bound. In a parallel antiviral assay versus EMC virus 1 fmole of l25I-IFN- y was equivalent to 0.15 IU. Specific binding at the highest IFN-~yconcentration here corresponded to about 6000 receptors per cell. On dilution of the IFN to a lower specific activity satuMtion binding was observed at approximately 10,000 lect;yLol~ per cell. Example 5: Activation of the Protein Tyrosine Kinase Jak2 in Response to Interferon-~y Sun1~nry Mutant ~y-1 cells respond normally to h~ relolls-~x and -~B but are defective in the l~yollse of all genes tested to hl~._.r~ ron -~y. The ~ can be complemented by the protein tyrosine kinase Jak2 (Example 4). In wild-type cells the Ll~ns~;,iytion factor p91, which plays a central role in the plinldl~y interferon- y signal tr~n~luction pathway, is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to illlt:l~roll-~. No such phosphorylation occurs in mutant ~y-1 cells, but it is restored on complement~tion of ~-1 cells with Jak2.Moreover, Jak2 is itself rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to il~te,re,ol,-y in wild-type cells. Interferon-~y dependent phosphorylation of Jak2 is also observed in in vitro kinase assays of immnnopreci~ilates from human and mouse cells. No such phosphorylation is seen in mutant ^y-1 cells or in lc~o,lse to hlLt:lr~n~ . These results in~ te a role for Jak2 early in the plillldl~ interferon-~y signal tr~n~clnction pathway. -d WO 95/03701    ~1. ~ PCT/US94/08676 6Qo~ o-Results Interferons (IFNs) -a, -,B and -~y induce overlapping sets of genes through distinct receptors (Pestka et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem. 56:727-777 (1987)). There has been rapid recent progress in the underst~nrlin~ of the signal tr~n~ ction paLl,w~ys involved. Central to this has been the re~ tinn that p91, a component of the complex IFN-a,B-inducible ll~nsc~ ion factor ISGF3, plays a dual role in the IFN-a,~ and -7~ ollse pathways.        p91 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to either type of IFN (Schindler etal., Science 257:809-813 (1992); Shuai etal., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992)). Conci~tPnt with this, p91 is required for the IFN-~y response of a wide spectrum of genes. It appears to correspond to the gamma activation factor (GAF) which was first identified as being n~cess~ry for the activation of Ll~l scli~ion of the GBP gene (Decker et al., EMBO J. 10:927-932 (1991)) and has since been implicated in the activation of a number of additional genes in response to IFN-~y through a common DNA motif (Shuai et al., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992); Pearse et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA 90:4314-4318 (1993); Kanno et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:3951 (1993)).Mutant ~y-l was, Lhclcrc rc, assayed for phosphorylation of p91.Phosphorylation of p91, monitored by incorporation of 32Pi, occurs rapidly in wild-type 2C4 cells. No such phosphorylation was observed in mutant -y-1.Phosphorylation of p91 did occur in 7~-1 cells complemented by Jak2 as monitored by incorporation of 32p; or with antibodies to phospholylosi-le.Normal lcevels of p91 were present and, hlLclc~Lillgly, phosphorylation of the p91 and pll3 components of ISGF3a by IFN-a was normal in the mutant cells (Phosphorylation of the p84 component of ISGF3a in response to IFNs -a or y is always lower and frequently .liffl~-llt to detect (Schindler et al., Science 257:809-813 (1992); Shuai et al., Science 258:1808-1812 (1992)).In addition, y-1 cells are not complementable by a functional p91 ~A~l~ssion construct. The defect in ~y-1 cells is, therefore, upstream of p91.Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was monitored by immllnoprecipitation with specific antibody followed by we~Lclll L~ rer ~ 95/03701 6809~ PCT/US94/08676 analysis of the; ~ P precipitates with antibody to phosphotyrosine. On this basis, Jak2 is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to IFN~y in wild-type but not in mutant ~y-1 cells. No such phosphorylation of Jak2 was -             obsened in response to IFN-~ under conditions identical to those under which phosphorylation of Tyk2 by IFN-~ is readily detPctPd.Tyrosine phosphorylation of p91 in response to IFN-~ and of p91 and pll3 in response to IFN-c~ were monitored in parallel as internal controls both for IFN activity and dt?t~Pction of phosphotyrosine using a mixture of Py-20 and 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. On reprobing the same Llallsrel with antibody to Jak2, comparable levels of Jak2 protein were detected in wild-type and y-1 mutant cells. The defect in ~y-1 is, therefore, in the phosphorylation/function rather than the production of Jak2 (see Example 4).A priori the aypalclll phosphorylation of Jak2 could be of an immllnologically cross-reacting protein. The antiserum used, however, was raised against a Jak2 peptide which is not conserved in Jakl and has high specificity for Jak2 (see Examples 1 and 2). Consistent with this, phosphorylated protein was not recovered when the immnnP plc;ciyiL~tion was carried out in the presence of the ~pl~,iate co~ e~ g peptide.In ~y-1/Jak2 transfectants there is a high "background" level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the overexpressed exogenous murine Jak2 even in the absence of IFN~y tre~tmPnt. The basis for this is not known. Against this background a variable increase in total tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 is seen in l~s~onse to IFN-~y in the complemented cells. In~ele~Lil.gly, however, even in experiments in which no obvious increase in Jak2 phosphorylation was observed in the ry-1/Jak2 Lld~rec~llL~ when assayed, a s~1bst~nti~l response to IFN-r was consistently observed in parallel in vitro kinase assays (see below).Tla-~r~;c~ed Jak2 can, therefore, be phosphorylated in response to IFN- y. It is re~on~ble to conclude that the phosphorylation observed in wild-type cells in l~,~onse to IFN- y is due to Jak2.Activation of protein tyrosine kinases in lesponse to growth factors cl~c~ir~lly results in kinase activity which can be det~Pcted in an immlmP      Wo 95/03701 PCT/US94/08676 ~6~9~ -112-plecipi~te of the activated enzyme. Jak2, activated in response to IL3 (Example 1) and ~lylh~opoietin (Example 2), shows similar ~par~ in vitro kinase activity. This is also the case for Jak2 in response to IFN- y. IFN~y-dependent kinase activity was observed upon assay of Jak2 immllnoprecil~i~les from wild-type 2C4 or mutant y-1/Jak2 transfected cells. No such activity was observed in response to IPN-~ or when the immlm~precipitates were prepared from mutant 7~-1 cells or from wild-type cells in the presence of Coll~ g Jak2 peptide. Phosphorylation of Jak2 is not restricted to human HT1080 derived cells, and is also seen in response to IFN~y but not -cY in other human and a variety of mouse cell lines, including mouse L-cells.          Di.~~ on The results pleselllt:d here together with those in Example 4 in(~ t~that Jak2 is activated in response to IFN-^y and such activation plays a role early in the primary IFN~y response pathway. Granted that p91 is phosphorylated at the same site (Tyr 701) in response to IFN-c~ and ~y (Schin-ller et al., Science 257:809-813 (1992); Shuai et al., Science 258: 1808-1812 (1992)), the normal phosphorylation of p91 in the y-l mutant in response to IFN-~x is of interest in this regard. One can conclude either that Tyk2 or Jak2 can each carry out phosphorylation of the same tyrosine or, more intriguingly, that there is an additional kinase(s) involved.Turning to the activation of Jak2, in the case of ~ hl~poietin this appears to occur through direct interaction of Jak2 with the ~_ly~opoietin receptor (Example 2). It will obviously be of considerable interest if there is a similar interaction in the case of the IFN-~ ~a~lw~y. The common activation of Jak2 by elylllropoietin, IL3 and a number of other cytokines (see Examples 1-3) raises obvious questions. A major thrust of future work will be to identify the nature of the ~roleills int~r~cting with Jak2 and the factorsd~   g the specificity of the re~onse.      J~ 95/03701     21 ~ ~ O 9 ~ .

A~ed to be present only in m~mm~ n cells which have been treated with an a~l~liate cytokine, such as erythropoietin (EPO) or interleukin-3 (IL-3).Thus, activation of the Jak2 catalytic activity is correlated with the biological activities of these cytokines.This correlation is further supported by studies using the tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitor known as gelle~Leill. Genestein is known to inhibit the ability of EPO to stim~ t~ cell growth.Inclusion of genestein at 0.1mM in the in vitro kinase assay described above results in a 2-fold reduction in the tyrosine kinase activity of Jak2.Thus, the inhibitory effect of gen~stein on EPO-in~l-lced cell proliferation canbe explained by its inhibition of Jak2. Exa nple 7: Production of a Constituhvely Active Jak2 Kinase From Insect Cells Since the active form of Jak2 may be isolated from m~mm~ n cells only after s~im~ tion with an a~ploplia~e cytokine, we have developed a system for the expression of catalytically active Jak2 which does not require wo 95/03701 ~ , ' PCT/USg4/08676 ,3r~9~ -116-cytokine stim~ tion. Speci~lcally, when expressed at high levels in insect cells Jak2 is col~liluli~ely in an active state. This expression was accomplished by insertion of the Jak2 cDNA between the NotI and SmaI sites of the baculovirus ~ srel vector pVL1392 (PHARMINGEN, San Diego Ca).This Jak2/vector construct then was co-transfected into insect cells with a defective baculovirus DNA (BACULOGOLD DNA, PHARMINGEN, San Diego, CA).Example 8: Cloning, Expression and Activi~ of Jak3 Many cytokines regulate growth and dirrelel,liation through interaction with lecepto,~ of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Although lacking catalytic domains, cytokine receptors couple ligand binding to induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Recent studies have shown that one or more of the Jan~s kinase (Jak) family members associate with cytokine receptors and are tyrosine phosphorylated and activated following ligand binding. None of the reported Jak family members have yet been implicated in IL-2 or IL-4 .~ipn~lling. Here we describe a new Jak family kinase, Jak3, and demonstrate that Jak3, and to a lesser extent Jakl, are tyrosine phosphorylated and Jak3 is activated in the responses to IL-2 and IL-4 in T cells as well as in myeloid cells.Janus kinase (Jaks) DNAs have identified by low stringency sw~;el,i,lg (Firmh~ch-Kraft, etal. Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990)) and by polymerase chain amplification (PCR) approaches (Wilks, A. F., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A. 86:1603-1607 (1989); Pal~ en et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA87:8913-8917 (1990)). A variety of cytokines induce the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Jaks. Jak2 is activated by ~ l~Lll.~opoietin (EPO) (Witthuhn et al., Cell:227-236 (1993)), growth hormone (Artgetsinger et al., Cen 74:237-244 (1993)), prolactin hormone (Campbell et al., Proc.Natl. Acad. Sci. USA in press, (1993)), granulocyte-specific colony stim~ ting factor (G-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Silvennoinen, Proc. Natl.Acad. Sci. USA 90:8429-8433 (1993)) and granulocyte-macrophage colony ~ 95/03701 21 6809~ PCTIUS94/08676 stimnl~tin~ factor (GM-CSF) (Quelle et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. su~mitt~d, (1994)). InLclreroll (IFN)-~/,B responses activate and require Jakl and another family member, Tyk2 (Velazques et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992); Muller et -           al., Nature 366, 129-135 (1993)); while Jakl and Jak2 are activated and required for the response to IFN-y (Muller et al., Nature 366, 129-135 (1993); Watling et al., Nature 366, 166-170 (1993)). Lastly, cytokines that utilize a common gpl30, or gpl30 related subunit, including IL-6, onrost~tin M, leukemi~ inhibitor factor (LIF) and ciliary llc:uloll~hic factor (CNTF) activate Jakl and Jak2 and to some extent Tyk2 (Stahl et al., Science 263:92-95 (1994); Narazaki et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, in press, (1994)).Notably, no activation of Jakl, Jak2 or Tyk2 has been reported in the responses of IL-2 or IL-4, which also utilize receptors of the cytokine receptor~u~.~rllily. We therefore looked for additional Jak family members that might be activated by IL-2 and IL-4.Previously P(~R approaches were used to identify protein tyrosine kinases in breast cancer cell lines (Cance et al., Int. J. Cancer 54:571-577 (1993)) from which a cDNA fragment was obtained that encoded a novel Jak family ember. The same kinase was recently ~letectecl by PCR in rat hippoc~mp~ t;ul~ulls (Sanchez et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91: 1819-1823 (1994)). Using the fragment from breast cancer cell lines, we obtained four overlapping cDNA clones from a murine B-cell cDNA library. The longest cDNA was 3.8 kb and contained a long open reading frame which would encode a protein with 1099 arnino acids and a predicted size of 122.6 kDa. The predicted sequ~nre (Fig. 6) is highly related to the Jaks and was 2~        termed Jak3. Murine Jak3 is 47%, 36% and 36% iclentic~l to amino acids in murine Jak2, murine Jakl and human Tyk2 respeclively. Jak3 contained atypical protein Iylvsille kinase catalytic domain as well as an amino ~ermin~l kinase-like domain. In addition, there are blocks of similarity between Jak3 and the other Jak family members in the amino tennin~l region.Translation of the Jak3 cDNA in vitro (Fig. 7A-B) gave a 120 kDa product. Comparison of the in vitro translation products of cDNAs for murine 2 ~ 6 8 0 9 PCT/US94l08676 Jak1, murine Jak2 and human Tyk2 demo~ dt~d that each could be distinguished by size; Tyk2 migrates the slowest followed by Jakl, Jak2 and Jak3 consistent with their predicted sizes. The in vitro tranc1~t~d ~rot~ s were used to determine the specificity of anti-peptide antisera (Fig. 7B).S         Allliselu,ll against a kinase domain peptide of Jak3 i,.,,,,l,.~l)precipitated Jak3 (lane 2) but not Jakl, Jak2 or Tyk2. This precipitation was not seen with pre-immnnP serum (lane 1) and was competed by the i"""""i,i,.g peptide (lane 3) but not an irrelevant peptide (lane 4). Similarly, anti-peptide antisera againstJakl orJak2 (Silvennoinen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8429-8433 (1993)) were specific and did not immlml precipitate Jak3. Lastly, an anti-peptide antiserum against a region of Tyk2 from between the kinase domains was made. Unlike the others, this antiserum was cross-reactive and recognized Jak3 and Jakl as well as Tyk2 but only weakly immlmnprecipitated Jak2.However, a cornmercially available anti-peptide antiserum against Tyk2 (Santa CRUZ BIOTECHNOLOGY Inc.) was specific and did not cross-react with Jakl, Jak2 or Jak3.Jakl, Jak2 and Tyk2 are ubiquitously expressed (Firmbach-Kraft, et al.Oncogene 5:1329-1336 (1990); Silvennoinen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA90:8429-8433 (1993); Harpur etal., Oncogene 7:1347-1353 (1992); Wilks etal., Mol. Cell Biol. 11:2057-2065 (1991)). To determine if Jak3 was ~imil~rly eA~ ssed, a series of cell lines and mouse tissues were e~minPd for ion by Northern blot analysis. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the highest levels of Llansc,i~L~ were cletect~d in an IL-2 dependent cytotoxic T-cell line (CTLL) which contained a single 4 kb lrallsc~ t. A comparably sized Llal~CIi~ was ~letectecl at somewhat lower levels in IL-3 dependent myeloid cell lines. However, Jak3 Lldns~ L~ were not detected in fibroblasts or a glioblastoma cell line. Among tissues, transcripts were det~cted at the highest levels in spleen and to lesser extent in liver, kidney, lungs and heart but werenot d~t~cted in brain or testes. Consistent with the initial PCR amplification results (Cance et al., lnt. J. Cancer 54:571-577 (1993)), Jak3 is also expressed breast tissue derived cell lines. Therefore, unlike other Jak family ~ 95/03701 216~9~ PCT/US94/08676 members, Jak3 expression is much more restricted and one of the sites of expression is the hematopoietic lineages.To assess the role of Jak3 in sign~llin~, the ability of several cytokines to induce Jak3 Lylosine phosphorylation was ex~mine-l by immlmoprecipitation and w~ ,., blotting with a monoclonal antibody against phospho~ylosille. In a series of IL-3 dependent myeloid cell lines, no co~ uLi~re or inducible ~ylo~ e phosphorylation of Jak3 was seen with EPO, IL-3, GM-CSF, G-CSF, I~N-~x, IFN-~y or IL-6. However, Jak3 was tyrosine phosphorylated in IL-2 or IL-4 stim~ tPd CTLL cells (Fig. 9A-D). In CTLL cells, IL-2 and IL-4 in-hlced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular L)lo~eills including aprotein doublet of 120 and 130 kDa, consi~l~"L with recently published results (Kirken et al., J. ~iol. Chem. 268:22765-22770 (1993)). As illustrated in Fig. 9A, IL-2 and EL-4 in~llre~l tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 (aJak3) which migrated at the position of the major 120 kDa substrate. IL-2 and IL-4 also in-lllre(l tyrosine phosphorylation of Jakl (c~Jakl) which co-migrated withthe 130 kDa substrate. No tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 or Tyk2 was detPete~l with Jak2 or Tyk2 specific antiserum. Lastly, the Jak3/Jakl cross-reactive antiserum against Tyk2 did not precipitate a tyrosine phosphorylated protein of the size of Tyk2 but did immlln~reci~ e tyrosine phosphorylated ~loleills that migrated at positions comparable to Jakl and Jak3, consistent with the results with the specific antiserum. Phosphorylation of the Jaks in response to IL-2 or IL4 was (letPct~hle within one n~inute following stimlll~ti-)n, peaked at 20-30 "~i"~es and subsequently declined similar to the pattern seen in phosphorylation of Jak2 by growth hormone, IL-3 or EPO(Witthuhn et al., Cell:227-236 (1993); A,L~e~ ger et al., Cell 74:237-244 (1993); Silvennoinen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8429-8433 (1993)).Cytokine in~ ce~l tyrosine phosphorylation of other Jaks activates their in vitro kinase activity (Witthuhn et al., CeU:227-236 (1993); Artgel~i"gel et al., Cell 74:237-244 (1993); Silvennoinen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA90:8429-8433 (1993); Muller et al., Nature 366, 129-135 (1993); Stahl et al., Science 263:92-95 (1994)). We therefore eY~minP~I the effects of IL-2 or IL-4 Wo 95/03701 2~ 9~ PCT/US94/08676 Jakl or Jak3 kinase activity. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Jakl was not associated with the activation of demonstrable kinase activity in immllnoprecipitateS conlparàble to the response seen to EPO (Witthuhn et al., Cell:227-236 (1993)). However, tyrosine phosphorylation of Jakl in the response to IL-6 or CNTF is associated with activation of kinase activity (Stahl et al., Science 263:92-95 (1994); Narazaki et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.Sci. USA, in press, (1994)). Jak3 kinase activity was not ~Ptectçci in immlmoprecipitates with the Jak3 specific anti-peptide antiserum. However, this anlise~u~ is against a peptide cont~ining the putative autophosphorylation site (E~DYY) which may hl~e~re~c with kinase activity as well as immlln~,precipitation. We therefore assayed imm~m~ precipitates obtained with the Jakl/Jak3 cross-reactive antiserum against Tyk2. Activation of in vitro kinase activity was readily tlPtect~hle in immlm~lt;ci~i~ates from cells stimlll~ted with either IL-2 or IL-4 (Fig. 9B). Moreover, there was a single phosphorylated protein in the Jaks size range which co-migrated with Jak3.No detect~ble phosphorylation of a protein migrating at the position of Jakl was seen, consistent with the results obtained with the Jakl specific antiserum.Amino acid analysis of the in vitro phosphorylated protein in~ tPd that phosphorylation occurred exclusively on tyrosine.The cytoplasmic domains of the EPO receptor and the IL-,Bchain have considerable homology (D'Andrea, Cell 58:1023-1024 (1989)).We therefore ~ses~ed the specificity of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 in cells that ~,c;ssed the EPO receptor. CTLL cells, transfected with the full-length, wild-type EPO receptor, express levels of high affinity EPOrec~Lo,~ culllpalable to transfected myeloid cells. Although the cells do not proliferate in response to EPO, EPO induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (Fig. 9C). However, neither IL,2 nor IL-4 inrl~lcecl tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. Conversely, while IL-2 in-h~ce~l tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3, EPO had no effect on Jak3 phosphorylation.An IL-3 dependent cell line, 32Dc13(IL2RO, ~ C;S~illg the human IL-2 ~ceptor 16 chain were also e~c~min~-l (Fig. 9D). These cells proliferate 95/03701 2 1 6~ PCT/US94/08676 in response to human IL-2 comparable to IL-3. IL-3 in~ ced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 but not Jak3. Nor was there detect~le Iylosille phosphorylation of Jakl or Tyk2 in IL-3 stiml-l~te~l cells. Stim~ tion with IL--            2 resulted in the Iy~osille phosphorylation of Jak3 but no ~etect~kle tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 or Tyk2. I1llPG1L~ Y, there was also no ~let~ct~ble tylu~il~ phosphorylation of Jakl. Thus, IL-2 and IL-4 cause the specific and consi~.Lelll tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak3 but not of the other Jak family members. Previous studies have shown that the acidic region of the IL-2 receptor chain is required for association and activation of the pS611'Ck (Hatakeyama et al., Cell 59: 837-845 (1989)). We therefore e~minPd 32Dc13 cells lla~recled with an IL-2 ~cep~or,~ chain cont~ining an internal, 70 amino acid deletion of the serine rich region. This mutant is the previously characterized A mutant which ~llppoll~ mitogenesis but not p56'ck activation (Hatakeyama et al., Science 252: 1523-1528 (1991); Hatakeyama et al., Cell 59:837-845 (1989)). Stim~ tion of cells expressing this mutant resulted in induction of Jak3 Ly~o~.ille phosphorylation comparable to that seen in cells e~ es.sillg the wild-type receptor.The result demol~.Llate that, among the cytokines e~min~, Jak3 is specifically tyrosine phosphorylated and activated in the cellular responses to IL-2 and IL~. IL-2 also increases the kinase activity of p56~ck, p59fyn, or p53/56'Yn (Taniguchi, T. & Minami, Y., Cell 73:5-8 (1993)). However, activation of the Src kinases requires the acidic ~1Om~in of the IL-2 receptor ,~chain, which is dispensable for mitogenesis and for the activation of Jak3.Thus the role for activation of Src kinases has been unclear. In contrast, the mclllblane proximal, serine rich domain of the IL-2 P chain, which contains the box 1/box 2 motifs is required for mitogenesis. A similar region of the EPO receptor is lc~ hed for association with Jak2 and for mitogenesis (Witthuhn et al., CeU:227-236 (1993)). E~elimcllLs are ~;ullcnLly in progress to assess the requirement for this region for Jak3 activation.IL-2 intluces the lylosil~e phosphorylation of a 116 kDa protein which could be cross-linked to the ,~ chain (Kirken et al., J. Biol. Chem. 26~:22765-Wo 95103701 ~,~6~ ~ PCT/US94/08676 22770 (1993)). These studies are similar to t_ose which identified a 130 kDa phospho~ ein cross-linked to the EPO receptor (Yoshimura & Lodish, Mol.Cell Biol. 12:706-715 (1992)) which was subsequently shown to be Jak2 (Witthuhn et al., Cell:227-236 (1993)). Based on the role of the box 1 and box 2 regions in association of other receptors with Jaks, we would hypothesi_e that Jak3 associates with the IL-2 rec~tor ,~ chain. Experiments are ~;ull~lllly in progress to assess this hypothesis.The activation of Jaks is often associated with the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the DNA binding activity of members of the _ignal tr~n~ducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family. In particular, IFN-cY activates STAT1 (p91) and STAT2 (pll3), IFN~y activates STAT1 (Pellegrini & Schindler, Trends in Biochemical Sciences 18:338-342 (1993)), IL-6 activates a new family member termed APRF or STAT3 (Akira et al., Cell in press, (1994)) and IL-3 activates a protein with plo~ellies of anovel STAT protein (Lamer et al., Science 261, 1730-1733 (1993)). In this regard, IL-4 induces the tyrosine phosphor,vlation of a DNA binding activity with ~,~pellies of another novel STAT protein (Kotanides & Reich, Science 262: 1265-1267 (1993)). A similar DNA binding activity is in~nre~l in CTLLcells by IL-2. It will be important to ~iet~nninp whether the IL-2/IL4 in-luce~STAT like p,oleins are members of the STAT family and co~ iLule specific substrates of Jak3. Nevertheless, it can be hypoth~ i7~o~1 that cytokine in~ cecl activation of Jaks and STATs may be a very general m~c~ "- by which cytokine binding is coupled to the regulation of gene expression.Recombination events bc~Lween the derecLive baculovirus DNA and the Jak2/vector DNA results in DNA encoding a viable baculovirus which will co~ ively express Jak2. Infection of insect cells with this recombinant baculovirus results in the high level e~lession of active Jak2 which may be purified by immlln~pl~,ci~iLaLion with Jak2-specific antisera. This source of active Jak2 will be useful in the study of biochPn ir~l propelLies of this enzyme, and can also be used in assays for inhibitors of Jak2 kinase activity based upon the in vitro Jak kinase assay described herein.     ~ 95103701 PCT/US94/08676 2l63o9~ Example 9: ActLvatLon of a Jak by IL,3 and II,5 demonstrated in huII~5Ro~        transfected Ba/F3 and FDCP-I cells Similarly as plt:sellted in the above examples, Ba/F3-huIL-5Ra and FDCP-I-huIL-5R~ cells deprived of growth factor for 16 hrs were either ~"~;"~ ted or stim~ te~l with either IL3 or IL5 for 10 min.

IL3 and IL5 stimnl~tion resulted in specific tyrosine phosphorylation of a band thatco-migrates with Jak2. The tyrosine phosphorylated band above Jak2 is attributable to the association of Jak2 with the commo~ beta subunit shared b~lween IL3, GM-CSF and IL5. ~rn~r~e 10: ActZvation of Jak3 by II~7 in the preB-cell line by IL~7 Similarly as p.csellLed in the above examples, DlF9 cells deprived of growth factor for 16 hrs were either ~nl~ ted or stimlll~te(l with IL7 for 10 min.

Biol Chem. 268: 7628-7631 (1993), gpl30 (Davis et al., Science 260:1805-1808 (1993), Jakl and Jak2 (Silvennoinen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1993 (in press) have been described. The rabbit alllise,L~", against Tyk2 was raised and purified against a portion of Tyk2 expressed as a gllltAthinne-S-L~a~sfe~se (GST) fusion protein (VelA7ql-P7, et al., Cell 70:313-322 (1992)). Expression plA~mi/l~~op-iale for COS expression of epitope-tagged LIFR,~ and gp130 were previously described (Davis et al., Science 260: 1805-1808 (1993), except that the LIFR,~ coding sequence was modified to contain 3 succe~sive copies of the myc epitope to i~ove selectability. Full length cDNA for murine Jakl and Jak2 were provided in the plasmid pRK5.                   Methods Cell lines were passaged and mAintAinrd as previously described (Ip et al., Cell 69:1121-1132 (1992). COS cell trAn~fectinns were carried out by a DEAE protocol (Davis et al., Science 260: 1805-1808 (1993)). Plates of cells were starved in serum-free RPMI mrt~ m for 2-4 hours, then stim~llAted with 50 ng/ml of the inrlir,~trll factor for 5 mimltrs. Cells were harvested and lysed as previously described (Stahl et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:7628-7631 (1993)), except that 1 % Brij 96 (Sigma) or 1 % NP-40 (Boehringer) was used as in~1ir~ted. Tmmlm~lcci~ ion, electrophoresis, and anti-phosphotyrosine immllnnblotting with monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology) and detection via enh~nre~l chemilllmi,.Pscellce (Alllel~ll~ll) was carried out as wo 95/03701 ~6~ -128- PCT/US94/08676 previously described (Id). For in vitro kinase assays, the washed beads were inrl-bat~d for 15 min at room temperature in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 10 mMMnC12, 30 mM sodium orthovanadate and 10 MCi of (g-32P)ATP (NENDUPONT). Electrophoresis sample buffer was added and the samples were boiled, ~ulJjecled to SDS PAGE, and electroblotted to PVDF. The membrane was then inr~lb~t~d in 1 M NaOH at 65C for 60 min to destroy serine and threonine phosphate before autoradiography.                   Results CNTF-~n~ e~l Responses are Associated with a 130kDa Protein Following addition of CNTF, a lecepLor complex forms that consists of CNTF, CNTFRa, gpl30, and LIFR,B. Tmmllnnprecipitation (IP) of the cce~lor complex with antibodies against LIFR~ (Figure 10) or gpl30 (not shown) following cell lysis in the delel~,e-ll Brij 96 results in the co-purification of a 130 kDa protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated. LIF and OSM, which also bind to and heterodimerize gpl30 and LIFR,B (Gearing et al., Science 260: 1434-1437 (1992); R~llm~nn et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268:8414-8417 (1993); Davis et al., Science 250: 1805-1808 (1993)), also show association and tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with an i~lPnti~appealdllcc (Figure 10). The purified lccel)lor complex also shows associated protein tyrosine kinase activity in vitro giving rise to tyrosine phosphorylation of both gpl30 and LIFR~, as well as the associated 130 kDa protein.Tyrosine kinase activit,v is also associated with LIFR~ in the absence of CNTF, although the 130 kDa protein is either not present or not ~i~nific ~ntly phosphorylated in the absence of the factor. Other experiments showing that this in vitro kinase activity has the same sel~iLivily to ~uros~olille as that observed upon addition of CNTF to intact cells suggested that this associated lylosille kinase activity is relevant to that which is required in the cell to ~P~ t~ CNTF-in~ red responses. Fu~ llllore, the 130 kDa protein appears ~ 95/03701 65G~ ? PCT/US94/08676 to be a good c~ntlid~te for this kinase since lysis of the cells in NP-40 does not give co-pl~rifi~ti~ n of either the 130 kDa protein or tyrosine kinase activity (not shown). CNTP and RP~te~ Pactors Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of S          Jakl, Jak2 and Tyk2 Experiments using specific antisel~ raised against portions of Jakl, Jak2, or Tyk2 reveal that all 3 of these kinases can become tyrosine phosphorylated following stim~ tion by CNTF, LIF, OSM, and IL6. Figure 1 lA shows that CNTF induces ~ylusille phosphorylation of both Jakl and Jak2 in EWl cells, and these yl`ul~ S appear to co-migrate with 130 and 131 kDa vL~hls that cû-purify with the receptor complex immlmoprecipitated with a-LIFR~. Fu~Lhtllllore, the addition of IL6 + sIL6R~x (Figure 11B), as well as LIF and OSM (not shown) to EW-1 calls also results in phosphory-lation of Jakl and Jak2 but not Tyk2. In contrast, IL6 stimlll~te~l U266 cells give Iyro~ e phosphorylation of Tyk2 and Jakl without a~al~lL change in the phosphorylation status of Jak2. OSM treated SK-MES cells reveal tyrosine phosphorylation of primarily Jak2, with smaller changes in Tyk2 and Jakl.In each of these cases, tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jaks or Tyk2 is associated with an increase in their in vitro tyrosine kinase activity (not shown). These results stand in contrast to previous results showing that stimn1~tion with GM-CSF, EE'O, G-CSF, IFN-~y, or IL-3 only result in Iyiusine phosphorylation of Jak2 ((Argetsinger et al., Cell 74:237-244 (1993);Silvennoinen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (in press; 1993); Witthuhn et al., Cell 74:227-236 (1993)). We conclude from these experiments that the CNTF family of factors can activate Jakl, Jak2, and Tyk2, although there is some variability in which Jak/Tyk family member is activated in a particular cell.         WO9S/~370~ 6~~ -130~ /US94/~8676--The Jaks Associate with CNTF ~B Receptor Components Transient ~ Çeelions in COS cells were used to determine whether the Jaks could associate with the ~ ,Cé~Lol cO~ ull~llL~ in the absence of factors. These e~ ~lents used carboxyl l~ lly epitope-tagged versions of LIFR~ cont~ining the 10 amino acid portion of c-myc that is recognized by the monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Davis et al., Science 253:59-63 (1991)). COScells were co-LIdl~recled with ~plopridte e,.~ression vectors encoding full length versions of LIFR~ and Jakl or Jak2, and Brij 96 lysates were immllnnprecipitated with 9E10 and then blotted with the antisera against either Jakl or Jak2 (Figure 12). These experiments show that either Jak can associate with LIFR,B in the absence of any added ligand. Furthermore, a ~!II.r~t~d version of LIFR~ which retains only the first 76 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain is fully capable of binding to Jakl and Jak2 as well. This implicates the membrane proximal region of LIFR,B as the Jak binding dom~in, which is co~ enL with the homology be~ween ~is region of the receptor with those in gpl30 and EPOR that have been shown to be required -              for signal tr~nc~ rtion upon factor binding (Mllr~k~mi et al., Science 260:11349-11353 (1991); Witthuhn et al., Cell 74:227-236 (1993)). Co-Transfection with R~eptor ,~-Components and Jaks Results in Ligand Induced Functional Response Further è~e~ lents in COS cells were undertaken to establish whether co-transfection of the receptor ~-components with the Jaks could reconstruct a ligand-in~ ced functional re~ e. Epitope-tagged gpl30FLAG and IL6 were chosen for these e~ ,ents, since gpl30 homodimerizes and becomes Iylu~ e phosphory-lated in response to IL6 + soluble IL6R~x, obviating the need for co-llal~re~;lion with LIFR,B (Murakami et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.USA 88:11349-11353 (1993); Davis et al., Science 260:1805-1808 (1993)).Following stim~ tion with IL6 + sIL6Ra, neither mock transfected (lane 1) ~ 95/03701                              2 ~ 6 8 0 9 8   PCT/US94/08676 nor gpl30FLAG Llal~rcclcd COS cells (lanes 2-3) revealed subs~llial tyrosine phosphorylation of gpl30 following i..   ,..     ~,precipitation with anti-FLAG and a-PTyr immnnoblotting (Figure 13). In contMst, co-i~ re-;Lion with either Jakl (lanes 4-5), Jak2 (lanes 6-7), or both Jakl and Jak2 (lanes 8-9) gives riseS          to a substantial increase in the in-lured tyrosine phosphorylation of gpl30 upon stimlll~tion with IL6 + sIL6Ra.     Di~l~ssi~n Altogether, these results in~lic~te that the Jaks can associate with the CNTF receptor ,B components, and become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to CNTF, LIF, IL6, or OSM, with concomitant activation of the tyrosine kinase. This most likely occurs through transphosphorylation as ligand-in-lnced hetero- or homo-dimerization of the ~B components brings their bound Jaks into close apposition (Stahl and Yancopoulos, Cell 74:587-590 (1993)). The filnrtion~l reconstruction in COS cells of ligand-in~ ed tyrosine phosphorylation of gpl30 upon co-LIa.~r~;Lion with either Jakl or Jak2 is co~ with the notion that Jakl, Jak2, or Tyk2 can function as the first kinases activated inside the cell upon ~eceplor ,l~ subunit dimerization, thus placing the Jak family of kinases as the most proximal intracellular step in ~n~ g signal tr~n~(luction of the CNTF family of factors.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
