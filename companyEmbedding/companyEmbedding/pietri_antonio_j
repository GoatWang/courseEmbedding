Good afternoon. My name is Sherilyn and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aspen Technology Fourth Quarter 2016 Fiscal Year Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Karl Johnsen. Please go ahead, sir.
Karl E. Johnsen - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016 results for the period ended June 30, 2016. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call today is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO.
Before we begin, I will make the usual Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ material from such projections or statements. Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2016, which is now on file with the SEC. Also, please note that the following information is related to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, August 11, 2016. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.
The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the quarter and then I'll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year and our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2017 before we open up the call for Q&A.
With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Karl and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We delivered solid results in the fourth quarter that reflected a strong execution by the AspenTech team in a macro environment that remains challenging. Looking at our financial highlights for the quarter, total revenue was $113.7 million, at the high end of our guidance range of $111 million to $114 million.
GAAP operating income was $49 million and non-GAAP operating income was $52.4 million, which represents a non-GAAP operating margin of 46%. GAAP earnings per share was $0.41 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.44, both of which were $0.04 above the high-end of our guidance ranges. Free cash flow was $47.5 million and we returned $75 million to shareholders by repurchasing 2 million shares.
For the full fiscal year 2016, we delivered total revenue of $472.3 million, GAAP earnings per share of $1.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.87, both of which were above the high end of our guidance ranges. GAAP operating margin of 44.8% and non-GAAP operating margin of 49.3%, up 420 basis points year-over-year. Free cash flow of $165.1 million, annual spend of $441 million, up 5.3% year-over-year and we returned $180 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 4.8 million shares.
We're pleased with our fourth quarter performance which enabled us to achieve the upper end of our 3% to 6% annual spend guidance for the full year. During the quarter, we saw broad-based demand from downstream and chemicals customers who continued to make investments to improve the efficiency and productivity of their assets. We were encouraged that the deal flow and customer dynamics around completing transactions in the quarter more closely represented historical patterns, reflecting the value customers realize from our solutions.

However, we have yet to see customers believe that oil prices have stabilized which would continue to weigh on overall demand. During our Q3 earnings call, we referred to some sizeable transactions in our Q4 pipeline. We're pleased to have closed significant transactions in the fourth quarter with two of the largest oil and chemical companies in the world. These transactions expand AspenTech's footprint across these customers' assets portfolio and demonstrate the positive impact of our business from the R&D investments made in recent years across our product suite.
In particular, in the PIMS-AO advanced optimization planning product, the DMC3 adopted advanced controlled product and in the aspenONE Process Explorer client data visualization product as well as in our engineering products. We believe these two transactions are a testament to the value we deliver to customers and our ability to grow our business in a challenging economic environment.
Our fourth quarter performance was achieved despite the fact that the three Latin American NOC transactions referenced on prior earnings calls did not renew. The macro environment in certain countries in this region remains challenging. And while we continue actively engage with these customers, the timing for any of these transactions to close is unclear at this time. We do not intend to provide further progress updates on these transactions going forward, but we will inform investors, if any of these transactions closes.
Turning to engineering and construction and upstream energy, this vertical markets continue to be under pressure, though we did experience a second quarter of positive growth for the SMB E&C group. The rebound in oil prices during the second calendar quarter was a positive development. Though we have yet to see price stability in the oil market, as we've consistently said, we believe price stability in a comfortable range for producers is a necessary step before customers in this vertical will have the confidence to step up investment in their businesses.
Looking at our performance in Q4, we saw a solid performance in our North America, Middle East, Russia and Global Accounts regions. These regions were also the primary growth drivers for the full year. From a product perspective, for the year, our engineering business represented 8% of our overall annual spend growth with the MSC business representing the other 92%. We were pleased with the performance of our engineering business considering that its growth was impacted by the macro environment impacting the E&C and upstream verticals.
Our install base of business at the end of the year on annual spend basis is split 67% engineering and 33% MSC. Our three core verticals of energy, chemicals, and E&C contributed 49%, 40% and 5% of our growth in annual spend during the year respectively.
Our attrition rate for fiscal year 2016 was around 6% which compares to approximately 3% in fiscal year 2015. The attrition rate is a new metric that we introduced to investors during our Investor Day in early June to measure the retention rates for our contracts on a dollar basis against our total base of annual spend. This is consistent with the number we shared at Analyst Day and reflects the impact from the challenges facing our E&C and upstream customers.
It is our current intention to update investors on this metric on a yearly basis. Karl will review our overall guidance later, but I wanted to take a moment to discuss our annual spend outlook for fiscal year 2017. We're reiterating our target of 3% to 6% growth in annual spend. This outlook assumes no impact from the Latin American NOC transactions that has not renewed and no improvement in the demand environment we experienced in fiscal year 2016.

As you know, annual spend growth can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of customer contracts and renewals, but overall, we feel confident about our ability to deliver another year of growth in fiscal year 2017.
Turning to the fourth quarter; energy, engineering and construction and chemicals once again represented greater than 90% of our business. Energy was the largest vertical contributor followed by chemicals. E&C was a negative contributor to growth in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our 10 largest transactions in the quarter, there was again a mix of engineering and manufacturing supply chain transactions. I would like to provide some color on this quarter by highlighting the following transactions. First, a global oil company signed a sizeable transaction with AspenTech to extend its use of our petroleum supply chain solutions after piloting our PIMS-AO solution and determining the significant incremental margin expansion potential from its use in their operations.
Second, a global producer of industrial gases decided to expand use of our Aspen Capital Cost Estimation product in its North American operations after evaluating ACCE against a competing product. This decision not only quadrupled this customer's token entitlement, but also opened up usage of the aspenONE Engineering suite. In particular, this customer sees an opportunity to realize significant value from the pressure relief valve sizing and flare analyzer functionalities in Aspen Plus, which further validates the benefits from the breadth of functionality available in this suite.
Third, a long-term customer, a global chemicals company renewed its engineering and MSC agreement while increasing entitlement and annual spend. The renewal will lead to increased deployment of AspenTech's supply chain management solution across many of their plants to improve operations through the use of our scheduling solution.
Finally, a large Russian refiner expanded use of AspenTech MSC solutions by implementing our Aspen Petroleum Scheduler solution in their scheduling organizations at their refineries, that we were able to grow token entitlement with this customer despite the difficult macro environment in Russia, reflects the incremental value a customer expects to realize by leveraging the synergies between our scheduling and engineering solutions.
At our recent Analyst Day, we outlined our future product vision that will be built around asset optimization. We have a comprehensive product roadmap that we believe will significantly enhance our leadership in asset design and asset operations, as well as expand our market presence to include asset maintenance.
A key element of our strategy is to leverage the large amounts of operational data and asset models in the aspenONE platform with a purpose-built analytics solution.
During the quarter, we announced the general availability of aspenONE Version 9, including exciting early analytics capabilities for column analysis inside HYSYS and Aspen Plus, which will help drive energy savings of up to 20% for distillation columns. Other innovations in Version 9 include the integration of the BLOWDOWN depressurization solution and Sulsim sulfur recovery technology that we previously acquired.
We have seen strong customer interest in this acquired safety and environmental technologies, which highlight the value of our tuck-in M&A strategy can produce. The Version 9 release has been received in the marketplace with positive customer feedback and strong interest and demand. We will continue to use M&A to augment our internal product development efforts.
During the quarter, we made another tuck-in acquisition of The Fidelis Group, a leading provider of asset reliability software used to help owner-operators predict and optimize asset performance as part of their risk analysis process. Fidelis' solutions are a great addition to the aspenONE platform and will help accelerate execution of our asset optimization strategy. AspenTech's highly scalable business model generates significant free cash flow, which we can deploy to support M&A and return capital to shareholders via share repurchases.

During the fourth quarter, we repurchased another $75 million of stock bringing our cumulative share repurchases to over $740 million since fiscal year 2011. As we announced last call, it is our intention to repurchase $400 million of stock in fiscal year 2017 based on current market conditions and business outlook. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow are a strategic asset for the company and we intend to continue to deploy capital prudently to support our growth initiatives and share repurchase program to produce significant shareholder value.
Before I close, I would like to welcome the newest member of our board of directors, Halsey Wise. Halsey has nearly 30 years of technology and leadership experience, most recently as the Chairman and CEO of MedAssets, a healthcare technology company. He also has a strong engineering software background from his time as Chairman, President, and CEO of Intergraph, a leading engineering and geospatial software company. Halsey's extensive operational and financial experience will be a strong addition to our board and I look forward to his contribution.
To summarize, AspenTech ended fiscal 2016 on a strong note. Our ability to generate over 5% growth in annual spend in a year that has seen significant disruption in several of our key markets underscores the resiliency of our business and a significant value we generate for customers. We're executing well in a challenging environment and believe we're well-positioned to deliver another year of growth and profitability in fiscal year 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl?
Karl E. Johnsen - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 beginning with annual spend. Annual spend which is a proxy for the annualized value of our recurrent term license and maintenance business at the end of each period was approximately $441 million at the end of the fourth quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 5.3% on a year-over-year basis and 2.5% sequentially.
Now let me turn our financial results beginning on a GAAP basis. Total revenue was $113.7 million for the fourth quarter and compares to $114.2 million in the prior year period. Looking at revenue by line item, subscription software revenue was $106.7 million for the fourth quarter, an increase from $105.6 million in the prior year period and down from $111.7 million last quarter. Services and other revenue was $7 million compared to $8.5 million in the year ago period, and $7.5 million last quarter. As a reminder, we recognized approximately $3.9 million of non-recurring revenue during the third quarter and did not have any similar revenue during the fourth quarter.
Turning to profitability. Gross profit was $101.9 million in the quarter with a gross margin of 89.7%, which compares to $101.6 million and a gross margin of 88.9% in the prior year period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $53 million compared to $54.7 million in the year ago period. Total GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue, are $64.7 million which is down from $67.3 million in the year ago period and down from $68.5 million last quarter. For the full year, total expenses were $261 million which was slightly below our guidance range of $262 million to $266 million. Striking the appropriate balance between making targeted investments for growth and maintaining strong expense management has been and will remain a core focus of our management team.
Operating income was $49 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $46.9 million in the year ago period. Net income for the quarter was $33.3 million or $0.41 per share compared to net income of $30.8 million or $0.36 per share in the fourth quarter fiscal 2015.

Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisition, acquisition-related expenses and non-capitalized acquired technology, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of $52.4 million representing a 46% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $50.5 million and 44% respectively in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income was $35.5 million or $0.44 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 based on 81.6 million shares outstanding, which was $0.04 above the high end of our guidance range. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $33.1 million or $0.39 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 based on 85.6 million shares outstanding.
For the full fiscal year, our revenue was $472.3 million and was in line with our guidance range. GAAP operating income of $211.4 million was an improvement from $179.8 million in fiscal 2015 while non-GAAP operating income of $232.7 million improved from $198.4 million in fiscal 2015.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. The company ended the year with $321.3 million in cash and marketable securities compared to $105.9 million from last quarter. The increase reflects the return of approximately $252 million of net cash that has been held in escrow related to our KBC bid.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our stock for $75.5 million, bringing us to a total of $178.6 million in buybacks for fiscal 2016. Looking at our deferred revenue balance, it was $282.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter representing a 2.4% decrease compared to the end of the year ago period. On a sequential basis, deferred revenue increased $17.3 million. The year-over-year decline reflects the continued impact of approximately $8 million in non-recurring revenue recognized over the past year that had been included in deferred revenue combined with lower levels of deferred services revenue.
From a cash flow perspective, the company generated $44.8 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter and $153.7 million for the full fiscal year. For the full fiscal year 2016, free cash flow was $165.1 million. This year's free cash flow is down from the $223.6 million generated in fiscal 2015 due to the fact that we became a U.S. corporate taxpayer at the beginning of fiscal year 2016. Adjusting for the approximately $69 million in cash taxes paid during the year, free cash flow grew approximately 3%. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website.
I'd now like to close with our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2017. We are reiterating our full fiscal year guidance that we initially provided at our Investor Day this past June. We continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $470 million to $477 million and continue to expect subscription software to comprise greater than 90% of revenue with our services and other revenue representing the remainder.
From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $268 million to $273 million. Taken together, we continue to target GAAP operating income in the range of $199 million to $206 million for fiscal 2017, with GAAP net income of approximately $126 million to $131 million. We expect GAAP net income per share of $1.56 to $1.62. From a non-GAAP perspective, we are reiterating our non-GAAP operating income guidance of $217 million to $224 million, and expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $1.71 to $1.76.
The increase in our GAAP and non-GAAP income per share guidance reflects the impact of our share repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. With respect to annual spend growth in fiscal 2017, as Antonio has already indicated, we are maintaining our guidance of 3% to 6% annual spend growth in fiscal 2017. From a free cash flow perspective, we are reiterating our fiscal year guidance of $160 million to $165 million that was initially provided at our Investor Day. Our fiscal 2017 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $65 million to $70 million.

From a timing perspective, we would expect to pay 50% of our cash taxes in the second quarter with remaining 50% paid equally in the third and fourth quarters.
As it relates to the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $115 million to $117 million, non-GAAP operating income of $54 million to $56 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 to $0.44 per share. On a GAAP basis, we expect operating income of $49 million to $51 million and income per share of $0.39 to $0.40.
In summary, we're pleased with our fourth quarter performance. We are executing well in a challenging market, which together with our strong expense discipline, is generating solid profitability and cash flow.
With that, we're now happy to take your questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair.
Matthew C. Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, want to dig-in a little bit on the large deal that you closed in the quarter that, I assume, drove some of the upside there with the annual spend number. So was this just that you had closed the deals for more than you had originally expected or factored in the guidance, or I guess what drove the upside? Because given you're maintaining your guidance for fiscal 2017 for annual spend, it doesn't seem like they were pulled forward or anything.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. I mean, look, when we had our Q3 earnings call, we talked about some sizable transactions in our Q4 pipeline. We've been working on these deals and we knew there was a good probability that it would close in the Q4 quarter and we managed to do so. It's more than one, but in general, as I said in my commentary, we also saw a broad-based demand for our products with our owner-operators in refining and chemicals. So it wasn't just one transaction. There was more than one sizable transaction, but there was also a good solid demand for our products in the quarter.
Matthew C. Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. And then with respect to the fiscal 2017 annual spend guidance, you commented that there's not an expectation of closing some of the national – those two Latin American or three Latin American oil company contracts during fiscal 2017. Was this the expectation all along or is this different in respect to what you've factored into your expectations for the annual spend for fiscal 2017?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, the annual spend guidance for fiscal 2017, what it says and I stated is that those Latin American NOC deals are not included in the 3% to 6%. So that doesn't mean that we don't expect them to close, but based on the dynamics that we saw over the last three quarters, we feel it is a safe or conservative thing to do not to bake them into the guidance. We'll continue to engage with those customers and we'll see if they close in fiscal 2017.
Matthew C. Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
All right. Great. That's it from me, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, the annual spend guidance of 3% to 6%. Maybe can you talk about how do you think the growth is between E&C, chemicals and energy industries baked into the guidance?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well Monika, the basic assumption that we've made about fiscal 2017 is that it will look a lot like 2016. We don't believe, based on where we are today and what we've seen, that the dynamics have changed in the marketplace. So we told you that almost 85%, 90% of our growth came from really energy and chemicals and that's really refining chemicals a little bit from E&C and some other from other industries, the rest, about 5% to 6%. So we would expect the same dynamic for 2017.

Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities
Got it. Thanks. Then your non-GAAP margins came in at 49.3% points in fiscal 2016, but you're guiding to 46% to 47% for 2017. So why so much margin compression or are you being conservative?
Karl E. Johnsen - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer
So Monika, it's Karl. I think when you look at 2016, you have to factor in the one-time revenues that we've talked about, about $10 million which brought them up. So you could kind of factor those in and then we are making a investment in 2017, but we are expanding our expenses that we talked about on Investor Day. So we're making some targeted investments into the marketing with digital platforms, R&D and a little bit of the back office.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities
Then Antonio, oil has recovered from the somewhat low prices we had seen. Could you maybe talk about, you have seen any changes in tone with your customers or how the customers are viewing the market?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I mean look, I think overall including customers, it was nice to see oil move up to $45 to $50 and stay there, even north of $50 for a while. But as you've also seen in the last few weeks, oil got down to $40 and now it's been back up a little bit to $45 or so. When we talk to customers, they feel that – they're just waiting to see what the bottom is really for oil. As I've met with investors and also you, Monika and other analysts. What I've said is that we need to see oil prices stabilized at a level that creates confidence in our customers for them to then plan to invest when their next budget cycle comes around in September, October, November for calendar year 2017.
But when you have oil prices still moving up and then down, and up again, it sort of gives a sense that things are not yet fully stable as far as the supply-demand equation. But there's a positive outlook. If you read the analysts' commentary, looks like oil is already coming into balance, and probably the supply will be outstripping demand towards the end of the calendar year. And that should be positive, but at the moment, I don't think there's enough there for customers or us to change how we feel about the current market.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities
Thank you so much.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.
Jackson E. Ader - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi, guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Jackson.
Jackson E. Ader - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. How are you? You called out that North America and Middle East and Russia were all positive regions in the quarter. I was just wondering if we can get an update maybe on Europe.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No look, Europe – Central Europe has a big chemicals industry and as such we saw good demand on chemicals out of Europe. At the same time, the E&C company space in Europe faced the same dynamics that everyone else did in the E&C space. The refining business in Europe has always been more challenged from a margins perspective than the rest of the world because of the dynamics there with really a contracting refining base. Nonetheless, we saw good demand out of Europe, but the combination of upstream E&Cs, they make Europe the standout that these are the regions that we called out were.
Jackson E. Ader - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then just a quick follow-up. As you look out into 2017, are there any large renewals? And I know you've talked about not anything past that are going to slip, but are there new large renewals that are coming up in 2017? And if so, what quarters do you expect them to come up for renewal?

Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Well, I mean look, as you would expect, every year we have a whole new set of renewals that come up because – since it's a six-year contract and they are distributed over those six years. We do have renewals, some of size and most of not great size, but the thing about the last 12 months is that we've also learned a lot about the dynamics in the market. We believe we understand better how customers are thinking about their businesses both in chemicals, refining, E&Cs, and upstream and going into 2017, I also feel that we're better prepared to work with customers on these renewals, but there's nothing there that we would call out like we have done for the Latin American NOCs.
Jackson E. Ader - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay, great. That was all for me. Thank you.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you.

The next question comes from Mark Schappel with Benchmark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking my question here. Antonio, with respect to the two large transactions with the large oil and chemical customers in the quarter, were those deals with the NOCs or were they with the independents?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, independents.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Independents. And then building on a prior question, in fiscal 2016 I believe the company had a higher than usual concentration of contract renewals – up for renewal with the national oil companies. And I was just wondering if you can give us an idea of what fiscal 2017 looks like, just generally, with respect to the NOC contract renewals. Is it above average? Is it below average? Average?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, but let me look – yeah, there's a lot of NOCs out there. The thing about 2016 is, there was a concentration of NOCs in a specific part of the world that we called out, and we also felt that the other two contracts, we needed to call them out. But the profile of our NOC business, understanding what it takes to renew business with different NOCs because not all NOCs are equal, it's not the same. 2017 looks different than 2016 and that's why we haven't called out anything specific to our renewals in 2017.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Operator
Your next question comes from Michael Morosi with Avondale Partners.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Michael.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
First off, you're obviously seeing a lot of strength in the downstream segments, your owner-operators in the chemicals. Could you talk just a little bit more about the sources of that. Is that some of the products that you brought into that market. Is it macro, is it some of the other things you're doing to educate customers, just so we can understand those drivers a little better?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Well, let me look. I stated in my commentary that certainly I believe that the investments that we have made in our products over the last few years and really five years or so, is starting to pay off. We've enhanced the capabilities, the optimization algorithms, not to get too technical here. We've re-platformed some products and done a lot to them, and introduced new, completely new products such as Adaptive Process Control and I think that's all paying off. DMC3 and Adaptive Process Control, it's in its third year, but now it's getting more traction in the market. We've done certain things to PIMS-AO that have improved our product and create much greater value for our customers than PIMS does and there's a series of PIMS.

In addition, even though the environment for refiners and chemical producers have been positive, I still think that there's always that pressure to continue to optimize and drive efficiencies out of their assets. And that's what you see in what these customers are doing. Look, we're also getting better. I like to think that some of our focus on digital marketing and how we're reaching out to customers and the messaging around our value propositions is having an impact. So when you see something like this, it's a combination of multiple factors, including a testament to the leadership of the company in the marketplace and our relationship with customers. So it takes a lot of factors but it's a good outcome, and we're very happy about it.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
That's great. Thanks a lot for that. And then, with respect to the annual spend, we appreciate the color on growth by segment, but how about by region? Are there particular pockets of strength that you're seeing?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, when I mentioned North America, Russia, the Middle East, Global Accounts, those are regions that showed strength in growth and better than expected, in some cases. In others, they delivered growth that was commensurate with what we would expect in a normal environment out of those regions. So some of those regions exceeded our expectations and others just delivered to what they should deliver on a normal environment. So you should take those four regions as regions that showed a solid growth.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
And then finally, it's good to hear that we saw sequential improvement again in the SMB portion of the E&C market, but you're still pretty cautious overall on that segment. How do you kind of square those two developments? And when do you think that strength in the kind of the more volatile end of the market will flow through to the broader market?
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Look, if you look at the metrics that we released, you will conclude that our E&C business was actually positive for the year when we had stated and felt that it was going to be slightly negative a couple of quarters ago. I think part of it is a turnaround that we've seen in the SMB business in Q3 and Q4. I like to wait until I see the spending patterns in calendar 2017, because I think the budgeting that will take place towards the end of this year for calendar 2017 will be telling about how that will flow through the overall E&C market.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
That's great. Thanks for the questions.
Antonio J. Pietri - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Done?

But again, thanks again for joining, and we look forward to meeting you on the road in September when we go out there to meet with investors and analysts. Thanks.

Good afternoon. My name is Namdi, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Aspen Technology Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.
Karl Johnsen, CFO, you may begin your conference.
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us to review our third quarter fiscal 2017 for the period ending March 31, 2017. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call today is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO.
Before we begin, I will make the usual Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections and other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and in our Form 10-Q for the third quarter fiscal year 2017, which is now on file with the SEC. Also, please note that the following information is related to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, May 2, 2017. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information.
The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the quarter and then I'll review our financial results for the third quarter and our guidance for the fourth quarter, as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2017 before we open the call up for Q&A. Antonio?
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Thanks, Karl, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon. We delivered a solid third quarter financial performance with revenue and profitability that exceeded our guidance.
Looking at our financial results for the quarter, annual spend was $452 million, up 4.9% year-over-year. Total revenue of $119.3 million was above the high end of our guidance range. GAAP operating income was $52.3 million and non-GAAP operating income was $57.4 million, which represents a non-GAAP operating margin of 48%. GAAP EPS was $0.47 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.52, both of which exceeded the high-end of our guidance ranges. Free cash flow was $56.2 million, and we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $100 million.
We're pleased with our financial performance considering that the spending environment remains challenging due to the market dynamics we have experienced over the past two years. Engineering and construction and upstream customers are focused on being profitable in a $45 to $55 per barrel oil environment that they expect to continue for the foreseeable future. They remain closely focused on cost controls and reducing their operating expenses after rightsizing their businesses to match the engineering personnel head count to the lower CapEx spend, which is about 40% lower than its peak in 2014 according to published reports.
In addition, the Latin America business environment with a major state-owned enterprises continues to be a net negative as the region on oil sector continued to struggle to recover from their macro environment and operational challenges. Positively, our owner-operator customers in the chemicals and downstream energy sectors continue to generate growth in the quarter. Similarly to last year, the growth from our owner-operator customers is offsetting the weakness and headwinds we're seeing from E&C and upstream customers. The continuous strength of owner-operator demonstrates the significant value AspenTech delivers to customers every day, as they increase their focus on operational excellence and asset reliability.

We did have a number of transactions with owner-operators a slip out of the quarter. As we have experienced over the past couple of years, the current environment puts a premium on sales focus and execution. For example, contract negotiations are more challenging and transactions experience greater scrutiny from customers before approvals are obtained.
As we enter the fourth quarter, we currently expect to achieve annual spend growth for fiscal year 2017 towards the lower end of our 3% to 6% guidance range. The guidance assumes a projected attrition rate in line with fiscal 2016 and is supported by the amount of new growth that the company will generate.
As we stated at the beginning of the fiscal year, the challenges in some of our end markets made possible a wider range of outcomes. We're facing the most disruptive oil price environment in an generation and are still generating growth, which we believe is a testament to the mission-critical nature of our products and the strategic relationships we have with customers. While we're focused on driving higher growth, when you consider the macro environment we're operating in, we feel good about our financial performance and the discipline we've maintained in running the business while making important investments in new areas.
Looking at fiscal year 2017, there are two primary factors we've seen in the market. First, now that we're a quarter into calendar 2017, it has become clear that the 2017 budget cycle for E&C customers will reflect the rightsizing of their business that took place in 2016 calendar. These customers are facing a year of flat to slight increase in backlogs, materially reduced engineering head count and significant cost pressures. Feedback we have gotten from customers indicate this environment could persist through calendar 2018. We're evaluating how to position AspenTech for improved growth in this market over time.
The second dynamic we're seeing is related to large deal activity for our MSC suite. Relative to last year, we have signed fewer larger deals and the ones we have signed have not been as large. Overall, we continue to see good demand from owner-operators, but we're coming off of two very strong years of growth in MSC and customers are absorbing the significant amount of new token capacity they've acquired in order to generate the value expected through the implementation of our technology. As we have long said, there are limits to how much new technology, our customers can absorb at any given time. We believe this is a temporary phenomenon and would expect to see better growth from this group in fiscal year 2018.
We will provide a specific guidance on our growth outlook for fiscal year 2018 at our Investor Day on June 8, but I want to provide some high level commentary on our expectations. Overall, we would expect to see growth improve from fiscal year 2017 levels due to the positive impact of the Asset Performance Management or APM suite. The customer response we have seen in the first few months since the launch of APM has been very exciting and it is translated into a strong pipeline of opportunities. In fact, APM opportunities represent about 15% of our pipeline at this point. In the rest of the business, we currently anticipate engineering will perform in line with this year and MSC will show a slight improvement due to the dynamics I just described with our owner-operator customers.
We remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity in our core markets and for AspenTech overall. We have been making significant investments across our product portfolio and we believe we'll further extend our market leadership and position us for improved growth when the spending environment improve.
The reason for that optimism was on display last week as we held our Biennial OPTIMIZE User Conference, which was attended by over 800 customers and prospects and was more than double the size of our last OPTIMIZE. This year's conference focused on our asset optimization strategy and the substantial progress we have made in bringing that vision to reality since we first introduced it at OPTIMIZE 2015.

As we have discussed in the past, asset optimization is a holistic approach to asset management that focuses on an asset's design, operation and maintenance in order to drive the highest possible financial return over its entire life cycle. By implementing best practices and realizing efficiencies across all three of these areas, we believe customers will improve the reliability of their assets and maximize their long-term value.
Our product vision is to bring all three areas together, so customers can leverage the vast amounts of data they already have to drive better, more informed decisions on how they manage their assets. AspenTech's leadership in asset design and asset operations provides a strong foundation to expand into asset maintenance with the APM suite. APM represents a major step forward in the market, starting with reliability analysis to better understand how to improve the overall reliability of a system of assets, an asset or equipment. This leverages analytics and machine learning capabilities proactively to improve the degradation pattern or breakdown of this asset.
We believe APM represents another significant area of opportunity for customers to generate incremental efficiencies and improve on their operational excellence programs. Ultimately, a customer does not benefit from the true value of asset optimization if they have designed and are operating a plant for peak efficiency, but the physical plant itself experiences a failure that shuts down production.
Despite decades of investment in preventive maintenance according to ARC, 82% of the failures and unplanned downtime are not addressable by this investment. We believe that addressing these vital issues for customers represent a significant expansion of the value creation AspenTech can provide to customers, as well as a meaningful expansion of our TAM. We look forward to providing greater insight into this potential opportunity at our Investor Day in June.
Finally, there are two other aspects of APM that provide us with the confidence that it will become a greater component of our growth mix in the future and support faster growth over time. First, the APM suite is mostly targeted at our owner-operator customers in the downstream and chemicals markets, where AspenTech solutions are used daily as part of their operating expenses. By increasing the mix of our business in markets that are not exposed to the cyclicality of CapEx investments, we would expect to see more predictability in our performance.
Secondly, we believe APM is more broadly applicable and can provide value in any industry, where equipment reliability and uptime are critical business issues. We continue to see interest from new customers in these industries as our existing customers further rollout the machine learning capabilities from Mtell and our existing OEM partner takes Mtell's products to market in this industry. In addition, reliability is a top priority in any of these industries and the opportunity to improve it through analytics technology, be it machine learning, multivariate analysis or root cause analysis will be a growth driver.
Now turning back to our third quarter performance, energy, engineering and construction and chemicals, once again represented greater than 90% of our business. Energy was the largest vertical contributor, followed by chemicals and engineering and construction. I will now provide some color on a few notable transactions signed during the quarter.
First, a global oil company continued their rollout of our Adaptive Process Control technology, DMC3, by upgrading existing controllers to the latest version of our technology. This customer will continue to expand the value created from multivariable control applications through this deployment. Second, a global E&C company that had been performing RAM studies, those are reliability, availability, maintainability studies on a reactive ad-hoc basis decided to adopt our Fidelis Reliability product in one of their Canadian offices as a new source of revenue by: one, creating the ability to offer RAM studies to their customers proactively; two, making available to project teams, an effective means of review and scope of deliverables and ensuring competitive bids and three, maintaining client engagement through both the CapEx and OpEx investment cycles.

Third, our global chemical customer decided to expand their use of Mtell's machine learning capabilities in one of their largest U.S. site, and expects to rollout the Mtell product to all their chemical sites in the United States. This decision was based on the long-term success of the Mtell technology coupled with AspenTech's technical and financial capacity.
Finally, a Latin American producer of chemicals that was a first customer in the region to implement our DMC3 technology in its chemical operations, is expanding the use of DMC3 based on the incremental value captured from it, and the reduction in time and resources to implement it. While we're making investments to extend AspenTech's reach into new markets and product areas, we continue to run the business with a focus on expense discipline. We believe our ability to make incremental investments for growth while maintaining the strong levels of profitability is a core component of our business model.
As Karl will detail later, our strong year-to-date profitability performance enables us to raise our fiscal 2017 non-GAAP operating income. Our substantial free cash flow is a strategic asset for the company that we continue to deploy in ways that deliver value for shareholders. In the third quarter, we returned another $100 million to shareholders by repurchasing 1.7 million shares. Our buyback program, which has been in place since 2011 hit a milestone during the quarter, as we have now returned more than $1 billion to shareholders since the plan's inception. It is our intention to continue to buy back shares as long as market and business conditions are favorable.
Before I turn the call over to Karl, I wanted to provide an update on our Executive Management team. Effective July 1, we're promoting Michele Triponey, currently AspenTech's Senior Vice President of Customer Success to Executive Vice President of Field Operations. In this role, Michele will be responsible for overseeing all global sales and services. Michele has been a valued member of the AspenTech team since 2005 and has a deep understanding of our customers, the industries we serve and the value our products deliver for customers every day. Michele and I have worked closely together since 2010, as she took on increasing levels of responsibility within our global sales and services organization. I look forward to partnering with Michele in her new role and believe her experience will enhance the company's ability to execute on our growth initiatives in this environment. Bill Griffin, who has served as Executive Vice President of Field Operations since January of 2016 has left the company in order to pursue other opportunities. I like to thank Bill for his efforts at AspenTech and wish him well in the future.
In summary, AspenTech continues to deliver positive growth and significant profitability in a challenging spending environment. We're focused on using our financial strength to extend our product portfolio and market leadership to better position the company for faster growth. Customer reaction to our product innovation has been terrific and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for the company.
With that, let me turn the call over to Karl.
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 beginning with the annual spend. Annual spend, which is a proxy for the value of our recurring term license business at the end of each period, specifically the annualized value of our term license and maintenance revenue was $452 million at the end of the quarter, which is an increase of 4.9% on a year-over-year basis and 0.3% sequentially.
Let me now turn to our quarterly financial results beginning on a GAAP basis. Total revenue of $119.3 million was consistent with a $119.2 million in the prior year period and was above the high-end of our guidance range of a $116 million to $118 million. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2016, we recognized $3.9 million of non-recurring subscription and software revenue.

Breaking this down further, subscription and software revenue was a $111.7 million for the third quarter, which is consistent with a $111.7 million in the prior year period and compares to a $112.9 million last quarter. When looking at sequential comparisons, remember that we recognized subscription revenue on a daily basis and the third quarter has two fewer days than the second quarter, which equates to approximately a $2.5 million sequential decline. Services and other revenue was $7.6 million compared to $7.5 million in the year ago period and $7 million last quarter. The timing of services revenue can fluctuate between periods based on customer demand.
Turning to profitability. Gross profit was $107 million in the quarter, with a gross margin of 90%, which compares to a $107.2 million and gross margin of 90% in the year ago period. Operating expenses for the quarter were $54.7 million compared to $56.5 million in the prior year period. Total GAAP expenses, including cost of revenue were $67 million, down from $68.5 million in the year ago period and up from $63.9 million last quarter.
As a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we had approximately $4.2 million of acquisition-related expenses. Operating income was $52.3 million for the third quarter fiscal 2017, representing an operating margin of 44%, which is an increase compared to $50.7 million or 43% operating margin in the prior year period. Net income for the quarter was $35.8 million or $0.47 per share compared to net income of $33.2 million or $0.40 per share in the third quarter fiscal 2016.
Turning to our non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisition, acquisition-related expenses and non-capitalized acquired technology, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $57.4 million, representing a 48% non-GAAP operating margin compared to a non-GAAP operating income and margin of $59.3 million and 50% respectively in the year-ago period.
Non-GAAP net income was $39.4 million or $0.52 of non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 based on 76.2 million shares outstanding compared to non-GAAP net income of $40.9 million or $0.49 of non-GAAP EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 based on 83.4 million shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $101.7 million in cash and marketable securities, a decrease of $38.3 million from the end of last quarter. During the third quarter we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $100 million under our stock-repurchase program. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, we have returned 6 million shares or $300 million to shareholders, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value through our capital allocation strategy.
Our deferred revenue balance was $268.5 million at the end of the third quarter, representing a 1% increase compared to the end of the year ago period and 11% increase on a sequential basis. As a reminder, our deferred revenue balance is heavily influenced by the timing of invoices and over the course of the year, we expect deferred revenue growth to generally be in line with the underlying growth in the business. However, there can be some quarter-to-quarter variability.
From a cash flow perspective, we generated $55.6 million of cash from operations during the third quarter and $56.2 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses.
A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website.

I'd now like to close with thoughts regarding our updated financial outlook for fiscal 2017 as well as guidance for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $118 million to $120 million. Non-GAAP operating income of $51 million to $53 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 per share to $0.44 per share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fourth quarter operating income of $46 million to $48 million and EPS of $0.38 per share to $0.40 per share.
Turning to the full year, we're raising our revenue guidance and now expect revenue to be in the range of $477 million to $479 million, which compares to our previous guidance of $473 million to $477 million. From a mix perspective, we continue to expect subscription software to comprise greater than 90% of revenue, with our services and other revenue representing the remainder.
From an expense perspective, we're adjusting our assumption for total GAAP costs and expenses to $268 million to $270 million, which compares to our previous guidance of approximately $270 million to $273 million. We expect GAAP operating income in the range of $209 million to $211 million, net income in the range of $137 million to $138 million and GAAP EPS of $1.76 per share to $1.78 per share. This compares to our previous guidance of GAAP operating income of $201 million to $206 million, net income of $127 million to $131 million and GAAP EPS of $1.63 per share to $1.67 per share.
From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of $230 million to $232 million, which is up from our previous guidance of $218 million to $224 million for the full year fiscal 2017. This would lead to non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.93 per share to $1.95 per share, which is an increase from our previous guidance of $1.79 per share to $1.83 per share for the fiscal year. With respect to annual spend, as Antonio mentioned, we expect to deliver full year growth towards the lower end of our 3% to 6% guidance range. In terms of free cash flow, we are reiterating our free cash flow guidance of a $165 million to a $170 million for the year.
In summary, AspenTech's third quarter performance demonstrates our ability to deliver positive growth, and strong earnings and cash flow in a difficult environment. At the same time, we're making significant progress on a strategic priority that we believe will deliver long-term growth and additional shareholder value.
With that, we are now happy to take your questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau.
Matthew Charles Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Antonio...
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Hi, Matt
Matthew Charles Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hey, just wanted to start out with digging in a little bit to the preview you gave for fiscal 2018, and with respect to the APM suite potentially helping accelerate revenue growth. So it sounds like in terms of the pressure you've seen in 2017, some of it has been on the E&C side, but then also a bit on the MSC suite as well in terms of not as many large deals or maybe more work in terms of getting some of those deals pushed across. But maybe you can parse out the difference of getting these APM deals across versus maybe some of the issues that you have seen with some of these MSC deals?
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Well, I mean look, I won't get into specifics of deals, what I will say though is certainly we did close a handful of APM-related deals, both with reliability analysis software and machine learning and we're happy about that. We're also very excited about the reaction that we got at OPTIMIZE last week from our customers.

With regards to our engineering and MSC business, in general, what I'll tell you is look I think over the last two years in order for us to deliver the performance that we have delivered both financial performance and growth performance, it has required tremendous focus on our details, both on how we manage the business and how we execute in our sales organization. And in Q3, we hit a bump in the road with respect to our sales execution, but I don't expect that that will be the case going forward so.
Matthew Charles Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it, okay. And then wanted to touch on the guidance a little bit Karl. I'm trying to parse out the difference between revenue guidance going up for the year and then being more towards the lower end of the annual spend guidance, what's sort of the difference there between the two?
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
So, it's really just the timing of how the annual spend comes in during the year. And for this, our revenue for the year is already baked because of the annual spend that we close in Q4 won't have an impact to revenue until Q1. So, it's a little bit of seeing that, also we've talked in couple other calls, we've accelerated a little bit of the cash basis revenue, and we've seen that come in and it's been a little bit of a benefit for that.
Matthew Charles Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Okay, got it. And then in terms of the reduction in the expense guidance, any changes there in terms of spending plans or hiring plans that is impacting that guidance?
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
I mean a little bit of it is, just in Q3, we're a little bit behind the expenses due to hiring which you can't make that up, because some people got hired later in the quarter and some got pushed to Q4. So, it's a little bit of that. It's not a change in the investment strategy of how we're deploying it, it's just a little bit of timing and then it's also how we see the people coming in and those investments being made in Q4 being pushed a little bit. So, not a change in the strategy of how we're investing, but maybe a little bit more in kind of the timing piece of it.
Matthew Charles Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay. I'll pass it along. Thanks for taking my questions guys.
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg.
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Hi, Monika.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest
Hi, Antonio. Thanks for your time. Thanks for taking the questions. First is, we have seen some improvement in oil prices end markets right, but not really improvement in the annual spend and especially the way you're guiding for the year would be modestly lower annual spend growth year-over-year. Maybe could you talk about what we need to see to pick up in the annual spend from here and maybe touch upon kind of the sales execution in Q3 what you little bit talked about?
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Okay. Well, I mean look, as probably you have seen, oil companies are reporting increased earnings in the last week or so, and that's as a result of oil being around $50 a barrel for the past few months. Now in those same articles what you hear and I attended CERAWeek in Houston in early March and heard it directly from the CEOs of these oil companies that attended that conference, and that they are also very focused on expense management, cost controls and running their businesses very lean. The CEO of TOTAL was very proud of having become the most profitable oil company in the last quarter, and there was a lot of bragging around that. So, there was a lot of bragging about their ability to produce oil profitably at $50 a barrel, which emphasizes the point on expense management and control, and just in general bill tightening. But very little announcements about new projects in upstream, which is really where the CapEx investment starts being generated.

I've also read an article in the Wall Street Journal, where they talked about the five largest western oil companies taking on $214 billion of debt over the last two years, three years to finance their dividends. So, I think, some of this profitability ends up going to address or delever those companies, and just in general builder cash portfolios.
What do I think is going to take for CapEx spend and eventually annual spend to grow in the engineering business, I think it's for the oil supply and demand balance to get more skewed towards higher demand and supply or the supply shrinking to a level where it signals to oil companies that if they're going to invest in new projects, there's going to be a market for that oil. Of course the dynamic right now at $50 is shale producers getting back into the game, because they are the most profitable operators and they are driving oil production, and therefore mitigating the rise in the oil price and that's why you see oil prices bouncing between $45 a barrel and $55 a barrel. And there's also an opinion that, that will continue for longer, but I think it's about the supply and demand balance coming much more into balance, and a signal to oil producers that they can go ahead and invest in this bigger projects. When that will happen, if I had that answer for you, I'd probably make a lot of money.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest
Thanks. Then you talked about 15% of pipeline is in APM, how to think about pipeline translation to revenue? What I'm trying to understand is, is your pipeline like 12 months of revenue or a year of annual spend, so kind of to gauge quantitatively the 15% of pipeline in the APM?
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Well, I won't talk about the specific, but we do look at our 5-quarter pipeline as a metric that we've always tracked here, even before I became CEO, as a Head of Field Operations is a metric that I used to track. And that metric is – the pipeline is in line with the metric, our historical performance is bounced up and down a little bit over the 6 months to 18 months. But it's also the velocity of conversion of that pipeline, and that sometimes what we experience in Q3 and not only our largest transaction for the quarter moved out of the quarter, but also a number of other deals. And I think there's a combination of factors, but certainly I don't like to make excuses and we're here to deliver outcomes and sales execution is what we focus on. So we'll correct that going forward and get back on a more healthy growth path.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest
Got it. Then Karl, you announced an acquisition of rights to OTS software in April, so is there any revenue you are baking in for the FQ4 guidance from this deal?
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
No, so the deal was really to just acquiring rights to technology, so it didn't come with customers or contracts or anything else, just literally buying the technology.
Monika Garg - Pacific Crest
All right. And just the last one, deferred revenue growth year-over-year was just kind of modestly up 1.5%, maybe could you walk through that or is it kind of just a factor of annual spend growth?
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
No, it's a factor of two different things. The first is when you look at the deferred revenue, we give the whole amount, but you really need to focus on just the current, the long-term is a kind of a hangover for some single-pays and some OPS deals that were linked to licenses that are just kind of amortizing down, so if you look at the long-term deferred revenue, you see that kind of coming down ratably over time.
So when you look at just the current piece, it had an increase of about – I think it was around 3%, Q3 over Q3, which is more in line with what you'd expect. But the second piece that influenced it was, we had a couple of large renewals at the end of quarter that closed in Q3, but because of the payment didn't do until the next quarter, because they get 30 days, what ends up happening is it comes out of what normally would have been in deferred revenue and it doesn't go back in until Q4. And if you kind of factor those and you'd be more at that 5% or 6%, 6.5% year-over-year growth in deferred.

Monika Garg - Pacific Crest
Got it. Thank you, so much.
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Yeah.
Operator
Your next question come from the line of David Hynes.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Thanks guys. So, maybe we could start with annual spend attrition. And I know it's a metric that you share only annually, but can you give us an update on how that's tracking at least relative to what we saw last year? I think last year you said it was 6%, I mean is it going to be more or less in line or we're going to see an uptick in attrition, what should we expect when Q4 comes around?
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Well, I think that's what we've mentioned. We haven't been able to make inroads into that attrition rate that is basically mostly driven by the E&C business. We've put in place initiatives in fiscal 2017 at the beginning of the year to see if we could mitigate that attrition rate of 6% last year. And what we're finding is, as I mentioned in my notes or in my script that the dynamic is one where these customers have right sized their businesses to a number of engineering personnel head count. There is a certain amount of entitlement that they need for our software to match that head count, and that's what the discussions end up being. Certainly there has been some cases where we've been successful expanding usage of the products, but what we're finding like with the oil companies, there is a strong focus on cost control and expense management and that's what's coming through.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yeah, okay. And then moving on I guess to the sales head transition, maybe some color, kind of when did this happened how extensive of a search did you guys go through? I mean you're putting somebody with largely a services background at the head of your sales team when you guys are embarking on a pretty major new effort with APM. So curious, the thought process behind that and any additional color you could share on – Michele and how you're thinking about that team?
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Yeah, certainly. Look, I won't talk about the specifics of when Bill departed the company or the reasons for it, but as an Executive Officer of the company, we have certain requirements to report and that probably will give you the answer. With respect to Michele, look Michele has been a member of not only my executive team as CEO, but my predecessor's executive team as well. She is also the executive sponsor for some of our large accounts in the company and she engages with customers on a regular basis. In her role as a SVP of Customer Success, she has to understand and drive her organization to engage with customers in order to make sure our products are being implemented, the adoption of those products implemented is sustained and in general provide support, in addition to just being exposed on a daily basis to our sales organization.
So I have no concerns whatsoever with Michele's capabilities and experience to step up into that role. Especially in the context of the environment that we're dealing with and that it is an environment that requires a strong focus on execution and that really means a strong focus on details, a strong knowledge of our products, a strong institutional knowledge, understanding of our customers, our customers deploy our products and how they get value from those products.
So if you look at the current environment and you look at Michele's experience, capability, skills and qualifications, I think Michele is actually a perfect fit for this environment. We did not conduct a search. I was happy to select Michele to step into the role. She has worked for me for about seven years. I know her very well. She is a grinder and I know she'll come in and play that role. In addition, I will partner with her to make sure that not only she is successful, but the company is successful going forward. So...

David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yeah.
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
...I'm very happy for Michele. She deserves a promotion. She was the best qualified person for that job considering what the company is going through. And with respect to APM, Michele has been involved in our APM strategy helping put words to the strategy, involved with some of the acquisitions and in the overall process, including setting up a professional services team, customer support and so on. So she will have no problem. There's also other decisions and actions that we're taking around our APM business that we'll ensure that's a business that will launch and taken care of so. Hope that answers your question DJ.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
No, that does. And look forward to engaging with her at the Analyst Day here coming up. Maybe one last question for Karl, free cash flow. Typically there's some pretty big seasonality, right. I mean, I look back to my model, which goes back to like 2008, 2009 and Q3 has always been kind of the highest free cash flow quarter of the year, sometimes quite noticeably. And to get to the midpoint of your reiterated guidance implies that Q4 cash flow is actually going to be better than Q3. So is there something unusual going on this year, why is it different than the previous, whatever it is seven or eight years?
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Yeah. So, we feel comfortable about the guidance and we're on track for hitting it. What really happened in Q3, DJ, was for our international customers we need to get a certificate from the IRS beginning of each calendar year, and this year the IRS was about four weeks to six weeks behind in schedule and getting those out. And so, by the time we got them to our customers, it delayed them paying us. So we pushed off – probably about $8 million to $10 million got pushed off out of the quarter into Q4. I think we've gotten almost all of it by this third week of April. So, we're back on track. It was really just the IRS slow, because they had a hiring freeze in the service. So, they just got backlogged in getting us certificates, but not that it will impact the year-to-date or the full year.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. That makes sense. Okay, great. Thanks for all the color guys.
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel.
Antonio J. Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Hi, Mark.
Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC
Hey, hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question here, I want to come back to Karl. And Karl, I'd like you to go back to an earlier question regarding the annual spend. And could you just go through one more time the divergence between the lower than expected annual spend and the higher revenue guide?
Karl E. Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.
Sure. So, the easy way to look at it, if you look at our year-to-date results and then you can walk forward from that for the Q4 revenue to get to the kind of the full year guide. And what you do is we're going to have to pick up a day of revenue in the fourth quarter, which is probably about $1.2 million, $1.3 million and then you get the annual spend from Q3 that comes in. So, that's the easy way to do the math to get there and then you kind of get a little bit of fluctuation around the services revenue. But the overarching view is that, it's how the annual spend comes in during the year. So, if annual spend comes in closer to the front of the year, you get more of that revenue throughout the year. If it's spread towards the back-end, you get less of it.
So, it's a little bit of the timing of where we were at the beginning – our initial viewpoint at the beginning of the year when we were looking at forecasting revenue, annual spend has come in a little differently. And then the last piece is really, we got a little bit of a benefit from cash basis, customers may have a little bit of good viewpoint into those in the fourth quarter that kind of rounds out the answer to that. So, it's really those three legs to the stool.

Mark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC
