Our History



While TreeHouse Foods, Inc. was formed in 2005, the history of one of our key operating companies, Bay Valley Foods, LLC, dates back to 1862 with the formation of Alart and McGuire, pioneers in the pickle industry. Bay Valley Foods has experienced many changes and expansions throughout the years. It was previously known as Dean Specialty Foods, a division of Dallas-based Dean Foods Company.
In 2005 Dean Foods Company incorporated TreeHouse Foods, Inc. to spin off certain speciality businesses. Later that year, TreeHouse began operating as an independent entity after completing the spin-off, and our TreeHouse has been growing ever since.
We proudly acknowledge the acquisitions that make our TreeHouse what it is today.


2005
Aseptic products, non-dairy creamer and pickles


2006
Private label soup and infant feeding business


2007
Fruit spreads, jams, preserves and pie fillingMexican sauces and salsa


2010

Sturm Foods is a subsidiary company that manufactures dry groceries under private label brands and distributes them to the foodservice industry and grocery suppliers throughout the world. Sturm Foods' origin was a dairy farm operation begun in 1905 by Arthur Sturm and his four sons. The boys began buying eggs from local farmers and shipping them to relatives in Chicago for sale there. This small business eventually expanded into other commodities during the 1930s, such as sugar, seed, twine, potatoes, flour, coal and gasoline. World War II helped increase the business, at that point known as A. Sturm & Sons. The company began manufacturing for the first time bulk amounts of dried food products, such as eggs and powdered milk, to be delivered to American servicemen on the battle fronts. The company entered the private label distribution market in the early 1970s and continues this business model to the current day. The business flourished throughout the eighties and nineties with a broadening product line and employment increasing from 150 to 500 employees. In May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by the LLC and private equity firm HM Capital Partners.
Monday, December 1, 2009 HM Capital announced that Sturm Foods was sold to Treehouse Foods for approximately $660 million. The purchase price is made up of $400m in new debt issuance, $100m in equity stock, with the remainder funded by TreeHouse’s existing revolving credit facility. With this purchase the US soup-to-salad dressings firm has made a move to further expand its dry grocery offerings. For the 12 months leading to September 30, 2009 Sturm generated sales of $340m. Following the acquisition, TreeHouse has estimated that it will have pro-forma sales of around $1.9bn and adjusted EBITDA of over $275m. The company also expects the transaction to be more than 16% accretive on an annualised basis following the acquisition, adding $0.38 to $0.40 in earnings per share.
Business model[edit]
The company's primary business strategy is to acquire producers of private-label products in Canada and the U.S.[24] It services both the retail grocery[9] and the foodservice distribution channels.[25][26] In addition to private brand non-dairy creamers, single-serving coffee pods,[27][28] baby foods, salad dressings, marinades, dips, soups,[29] sauces, dry mix pasta dinners, jams, spreads, and cereals[16] the company also maintains several brand name products including McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Cremora[1] non-dairy coffee lightener, Second Nature egg substitutes, and Nature's Goodness baby foods.[4]

Sturm Foods is a subsidiary company that manufactures dry groceries under private label brands and distributes them to the foodservice industry and grocery suppliers throughout the world. Sturm Foods' origin was a dairy farm operation begun in 1905 by Arthur Sturm and his four sons. The boys began buying eggs from local farmers and shipping them to relatives in Chicago for sale there. This small business eventually expanded into other commodities during the 1930s, such as sugar, seed, twine, potatoes, flour, coal and gasoline. World War II helped increase the business, at that point known as A. Sturm & Sons. The company began manufacturing for the first time bulk amounts of dried food products, such as eggs and powdered milk, to be delivered to American servicemen on the battle fronts. The company entered the private label distribution market in the early 1970s and continues this business model to the current day. The business flourished throughout the eighties and nineties with a broadening product line and employment increasing from 150 to 500 employees. In May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by the LLC and private equity firm HM Capital Partners.
Monday, December 1, 2009 HM Capital announced that Sturm Foods was sold to Treehouse Foods for approximately $660 million. The purchase price is made up of $400m in new debt issuance, $100m in equity stock, with the remainder funded by TreeHouse’s existing revolving credit facility. With this purchase the US soup-to-salad dressings firm has made a move to further expand its dry grocery offerings. For the 12 months leading to September 30, 2009 Sturm generated sales of $340m. Following the acquisition, TreeHouse has estimated that it will have pro-forma sales of around $1.9bn and adjusted EBITDA of over $275m. The company also expects the transaction to be more than 16% accretive on an annualised basis following the acquisition, adding $0.38 to $0.40 in earnings per share.
Business model[edit]
The company's primary business strategy is to acquire producers of private-label products in Canada and the U.S.[24] It services both the retail grocery[9] and the foodservice distribution channels.[25][26] In addition to private brand non-dairy creamers, single-serving coffee pods,[27][28] baby foods, salad dressings, marinades, dips, soups,[29] sauces, dry mix pasta dinners, jams, spreads, and cereals[16] the company also maintains several brand name products including McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Cremora[1] non-dairy coffee lightener, Second Nature egg substitutes, and Nature's Goodness baby foods.[4]

Sturm Foods is a subsidiary company that manufactures dry groceries under private label brands and distributes them to the foodservice industry and grocery suppliers throughout the world. Sturm Foods' origin was a dairy farm operation begun in 1905 by Arthur Sturm and his four sons. The boys began buying eggs from local farmers and shipping them to relatives in Chicago for sale there. This small business eventually expanded into other commodities during the 1930s, such as sugar, seed, twine, potatoes, flour, coal and gasoline. World War II helped increase the business, at that point known as A. Sturm & Sons. The company began manufacturing for the first time bulk amounts of dried food products, such as eggs and powdered milk, to be delivered to American servicemen on the battle fronts. The company entered the private label distribution market in the early 1970s and continues this business model to the current day. The business flourished throughout the eighties and nineties with a broadening product line and employment increasing from 150 to 500 employees. In May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by the LLC and private equity firm HM Capital Partners.
Monday, December 1, 2009 HM Capital announced that Sturm Foods was sold to Treehouse Foods for approximately $660 million. The purchase price is made up of $400m in new debt issuance, $100m in equity stock, with the remainder funded by TreeHouse’s existing revolving credit facility. With this purchase the US soup-to-salad dressings firm has made a move to further expand its dry grocery offerings. For the 12 months leading to September 30, 2009 Sturm generated sales of $340m. Following the acquisition, TreeHouse has estimated that it will have pro-forma sales of around $1.9bn and adjusted EBITDA of over $275m. The company also expects the transaction to be more than 16% accretive on an annualised basis following the acquisition, adding $0.38 to $0.40 in earnings per share.
Business model[edit]
The company's primary business strategy is to acquire producers of private-label products in Canada and the U.S.[24] It services both the retail grocery[9] and the foodservice distribution channels.[25][26] In addition to private brand non-dairy creamers, single-serving coffee pods,[27][28] baby foods, salad dressings, marinades, dips, soups,[29] sauces, dry mix pasta dinners, jams, spreads, and cereals[16] the company also maintains several brand name products including McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Cremora[1] non-dairy coffee lightener, Second Nature egg substitutes, and Nature's Goodness baby foods.[4]

Sturm Foods is a subsidiary company that manufactures dry groceries under private label brands and distributes them to the foodservice industry and grocery suppliers throughout the world. Sturm Foods' origin was a dairy farm operation begun in 1905 by Arthur Sturm and his four sons. The boys began buying eggs from local farmers and shipping them to relatives in Chicago for sale there. This small business eventually expanded into other commodities during the 1930s, such as sugar, seed, twine, potatoes, flour, coal and gasoline. World War II helped increase the business, at that point known as A. Sturm & Sons. The company began manufacturing for the first time bulk amounts of dried food products, such as eggs and powdered milk, to be delivered to American servicemen on the battle fronts. The company entered the private label distribution market in the early 1970s and continues this business model to the current day. The business flourished throughout the eighties and nineties with a broadening product line and employment increasing from 150 to 500 employees. In May 2005, Sturm Foods was acquired by the LLC and private equity firm HM Capital Partners.
Monday, December 1, 2009 HM Capital announced that Sturm Foods was sold to Treehouse Foods for approximately $660 million. The purchase price is made up of $400m in new debt issuance, $100m in equity stock, with the remainder funded by TreeHouse’s existing revolving credit facility. With this purchase the US soup-to-salad dressings firm has made a move to further expand its dry grocery offerings. For the 12 months leading to September 30, 2009 Sturm generated sales of $340m. Following the acquisition, TreeHouse has estimated that it will have pro-forma sales of around $1.9bn and adjusted EBITDA of over $275m. The company also expects the transaction to be more than 16% accretive on an annualised basis following the acquisition, adding $0.38 to $0.40 in earnings per share.
Business model[edit]
The company's primary business strategy is to acquire producers of private-label products in Canada and the U.S.[24] It services both the retail grocery[9] and the foodservice distribution channels.[25][26] In addition to private brand non-dairy creamers, single-serving coffee pods,[27][28] baby foods, salad dressings, marinades, dips, soups,[29] sauces, dry mix pasta dinners, jams, spreads, and cereals[16] the company also maintains several brand name products including McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Cremora[1] non-dairy coffee lightener, Second Nature egg substitutes, and Nature's Goodness baby foods.[4]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
