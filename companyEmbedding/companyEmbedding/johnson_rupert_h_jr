Rupert H. Johnson, Sr. 1921


Cullum No. 6825 • Mar 12, 1989 • Died in Bal Harbour, Florida
Interred in Mount Herbon Cemetery, Upper Montclair, NJ

Rupert H. “Johnny” Johnson, Sr. was a proud member of the “Oriole” class—those who entered West Point in November of 1918. He was born 15 August 1899 on a farm in Anson, Texas; his parents were Mary Esther Morrow and Albert Washington Johnson. He attended Hardin-Simmons College until the outbreak of World War I in 1917. Johnny immediately enlisted and was serving in France in 1918 when he received an appointment to West Point.

		On 2 November 1918, the date of his arrival at West Point, the Corps consisted of one class—the plebes who had been cadets for only a few months. Early graduation of the senior classes had virtually decimated the Corps. Because Johnny’s class was scheduled to be commissioned after only a few months training, he and his classmates were issued enlisted men’s uniforms with one major exception—the hat band was of a bright, orange color; hence the nickname “The Orioles,” a name proudly borne to this day.

		After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the two fourth classes became one Corps of Cadets. Fourth Class A became the upper class and Fourth Class B, the plebes. And that’s the way it was until 1 July 1919, when the new class arrived at West Point. The members of Fourth Class A graduated in 1920 and the members of Johnny’s Fourth Class B in 1921 and 1922.

		We, who were cadets with Johnny, recognized that he possessed those qualities which would assure his success in life. He was dedicated to the high principles of West Point, and he was determined to excel. His competitive spirit remained with him throughout his life. It motivated him to become an outstanding success in the financial world. He demonstrated his athletic ability in baseball, basketball, polo, and boxing (Welterweight Champion).

		Following his graduation in 1921, Johnny attended, and was graduated from, the Infantry Officers School, Fort Benning, Georgia. Then he was stationed at Governors Island, New York. During this tour he met several successful New Yorkers. He decided to resign his commission and enter the business world where he enjoyed outstanding success.

		Within a few years, he founded R.H. Johnson and Company, a general securities firm and investment banking house. He founded in 1947 the Franklin Group of Mutual Funds, now one of the largest mutual fund organizations in the United States. In the operation of his business, Johnny always gave top priority to the client’s best interests. This “Spirit of Service” provided the foundation on which he built a successful and prosperous business. During those years his preferred activities were big game hunting all over the world and golf. He founded the Eastern Seniors Golf Association.

		Although he retired from active business in 1956, he continued to enjoy a vigorous, energetic life. He was president of the St. Andrew’s Society; member of the Explorer’s Club of New York; Siwanoy Country Club, Bronxville, New York; the Indian Creek, La Gorce and Surf Clubs of Miami Beach; and Montclair Golf Club. He served on the Board of Trustees of the Biblical Seminary of New York City and was a member of the Committee of One Hundred of Miami Beach, Florida.

		He established the Rupert Johnson Cadet Loan Fund at West Point, and donated to Hardin-Simmons University School of Business, the Albert W. and Mary E. Johnson Building.

		He is survived by his wife Amybelle Siler Johnson and seven children: Mary Frances Furlong of Montclair; Florence Marie Jacobson of Verona; Andrew R. Johnson of San Mateo, California; Charles B. Johnson and Rupert H. Johnson, Jr., both of Hillsborough, California; Bonnie Lee Sacerdote of New York City; and Suzanne Olden Razor of Salt Lake City. In addition, Mr. Johnson’s second daughter was the late Dorothy Elizabeth McGuire, a life-long resident of Upper Montclair.

		He also leaves thirty-three grandchildren, eighteen great-grandchildren, three sisters: Mrs. Audrey Martin of Dallas, Texas; Mrs. Mary Behrens of Abilene, Texas; and Mrs. Margaret Hancock of Long Beach, California; and a brother, Albert W. Johnson, Jr., of Texas.

		Services were held Thursday, 16 March 1989, at the Church by the Sea, Bal Harbour, Florida. Interment was in Mount Hebron Cemetery, Upper Montclair, New Jersey.

		Johnny’s love for West Point increased with the years. He attended every class reunion. His enthusiastic, fun loving presence will be missed.

History of Franklin Resources, Inc.







 
1940s1950s1960s1970s1980s1990s2000s2010s







1940s
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street. He named the company for US founding father Benjamin Franklin because Franklin epitomised the ideas of frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing. The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.











1950s
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million. Franklin was swimming against the tide because insurance companies dominated the middle class investing markets, but Charlie was convinced that he had a good story to tell.











1960s
By the early 1960s Charlie and his team's persistence was paying off and the company was growing albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles. A decade of extreme bull and bear cycles, the 1960s was an exciting time to be in the industry.











1970s
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organisation had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund (not available to UK investors) began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's tremendous asset growth in the 1980s.











1980s
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986 under the ticker symbol "BEN". In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds). Not one to rest on their laurels, management was concerned about Franklin's heavy emphasis on fixed income investments that had become the company's bread and butter.











1990s
Strategic acquisitions in the 1990s helped Franklin diversify its investment management capabilities beyond fixed income and also expand its global footprint throughout Europe and Asia. In 1992, after striking a deal with famed global investor Sir John Templeton for the acquisition of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd., Charlie was named Fund Leader of the Year for spearheading what was then the largest merger of an independent mutual fund company in history. Templeton gave the company a strong portfolio of international equity funds as well as the expertise of emerging markets guru Dr. Mark Mobius, who currently leads a team of emerging markets analysts and manages emerging markets portfolios. Dr. Mobius has spent more than 40 years working in emerging markets all over the world. Then in 1996, in an effort to broaden its line of domestic equity products, Franklin Templeton bought Heine Securities Corporation, investment adviser to Mutual Series Fund, Inc., from Wall Street icon Michael Price.











2000s
Several more key acquisitions solidified the company's position as a premier global investment management organisation: Bissett in 2000, Fiduciary Trust in 2001 and Darby in 2003. In 2005, Gregory E. Johnson (Greg), Charlie's son, became chief executive officer, assuming overall responsibility for leading Franklin Templeton Investments. Greg had grown up in the business and worked his way through the organisation beginning on the trading desk at age 24 in 1985. Charlie retained his role as chairman and continued to provide guidance to Greg and his leadership team.











2010s
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia, Mexico, the UK and US that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. In 2012, the acquisition of K2 Advisors, a provider of integrated hedge fund and alternative investment products and solutions, combined Franklin Templeton’s world class retail knowledge, distribution capabilities and brand together with K2’s 20 years of hedge fund expertise, which resulted in a very strong entry into the multi-alternative mutual fund business.
To meet the evolving needs of investors, Franklin Templeton entered the exchange traded fund (ETF) market in 2014 with the launch of the Franklin Liberty Short Duration U.S. Government ETF. And in 2016, we extended our suite of ETFs by launching a global ETF platform, Franklin LibertyShares™. LibertyShares offers simple and efficient options, including active and strategic beta ETFs, to help investors seek better outcomes.
In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman. During his distinguished career, Charlie successfully navigated Franklin Templeton through more than 50 years of growth and change. Charlie believed that success is built on hard work, dedication and persistence in service to our clients.
Greg Johnson is currently chairman of the board and CEO. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in over 30 countries and clients in more than 170.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.[citation needed] He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.[3] The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.
By the early 1960s the company was growing, albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles.
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).
In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.[4]
In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.
Fiduciary Trust Company, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.[5] 87 employees died in the collapse.[6][7] Ann Tatlock, the CEO of Fiduciary Trust Co. International was at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha for a charity event hosted by Warren Buffett.[8][9][10]
The firm specializes in conservatively managed mutual funds. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.
As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide.[11] In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies.[12]
In April 2007, USA Today listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982.[13] In February 2009, Barron's Magazine called Franklin Templeton "King of the Decade" among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.[14]
The company sponsored a tennis tournament, the Franklin Templeton Classic.
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia and the UK, that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in 35 countries and clients in more than 150. In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman and Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.
Mutual funds[edit]
Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.
Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets[when?]), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets).
The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category and "large/value" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).
Regulatory issues[edit]
In 2004, Franklin Templeton paid fines to the State of California, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle issues regarding questionable practices including market timing. The plan for distribution of settlement monies of $50 million[15] was completed in September 2006, and all distributions have been completed as of December 2008.[16]
A settlement was also completed with the Ontario Securities Commission concerning Bissett Funds in September 2005.[16]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.[citation needed] He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.[3] The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.
By the early 1960s the company was growing, albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles.
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).
In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.[4]
In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.
Fiduciary Trust Company, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.[5] 87 employees died in the collapse.[6][7] Ann Tatlock, the CEO of Fiduciary Trust Co. International was at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha for a charity event hosted by Warren Buffett.[8][9][10]
The firm specializes in conservatively managed mutual funds. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.
As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide.[11] In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies.[12]
In April 2007, USA Today listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982.[13] In February 2009, Barron's Magazine called Franklin Templeton "King of the Decade" among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.[14]
The company sponsored a tennis tournament, the Franklin Templeton Classic.
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia and the UK, that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in 35 countries and clients in more than 150. In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman and Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.
Mutual funds[edit]
Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.
Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets[when?]), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets).
The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category and "large/value" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).
Regulatory issues[edit]
In 2004, Franklin Templeton paid fines to the State of California, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle issues regarding questionable practices including market timing. The plan for distribution of settlement monies of $50 million[15] was completed in September 2006, and all distributions have been completed as of December 2008.[16]
A settlement was also completed with the Ontario Securities Commission concerning Bissett Funds in September 2005.[16]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street.[citation needed] He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing.[3] The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million.
By the early 1960s the company was growing, albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles.
Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield & Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organization had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's significant asset growth in the 1980s.
Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986. In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds).
In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith & Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm.[4]
In November 1996, Heine Securities Corporation, known for the Mutual Series of funds, merged into the Franklin Templeton complex. In October 2000, Franklin acquired Bissett Funds to increase its Canadian presence, and Bissett remains a key brand from Franklin in the Canadian market. The Fiduciary Trust Company was acquired by Franklin Templeton in April 2001.
Fiduciary Trust Company, a member of the Franklin family, maintained an office of over 650 employees in Two World Trade Center during the September 11 attacks in 2001.[5] 87 employees died in the collapse.[6][7] Ann Tatlock, the CEO of Fiduciary Trust Co. International was at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha for a charity event hosted by Warren Buffett.[8][9][10]
The firm specializes in conservatively managed mutual funds. It offers products under the Franklin, Templeton, Mutual Series and Fiduciary brand names. Like other large investment companies, the firm offers a wide variety of funds but is traditionally best known for bond funds under the Franklin brand, international funds under the Templeton brand, and value funds under the Mutual Series brand.
As of July 31, 2008, Franklin Resources, Inc. managed over $570 billion in total assets worldwide.[11] In April 2007, Franklin Resources was 445th in the Fortune 500, and 7th overall among securities companies.[12]
In April 2007, USA Today listed BEN stock as the top stock pick for the last 25 years based on returns, claiming it is up 64,224% since 1982.[13] In February 2009, Barron's Magazine called Franklin Templeton "King of the Decade" among fund families over the ten-year period ending in 2008.[14]
The company sponsored a tennis tournament, the Franklin Templeton Classic.
The firm continues to make strategic investments and acquisitions, including asset managers in Australia and the UK, that further broaden and diversify its capabilities. Today, Franklin Templeton is one of the largest independent global asset management firms in the world with offices in 35 countries and clients in more than 150. In 2013, Charlie Johnson retired as chairman and Greg Johnson became chairman of the board, CEO and president.
Mutual funds[edit]
Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin.
Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets[when?]), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets).
The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's "conservative allocation" category and "large/value" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%).
Regulatory issues[edit]
In 2004, Franklin Templeton paid fines to the State of California, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to settle issues regarding questionable practices including market timing. The plan for distribution of settlement monies of $50 million[15] was completed in September 2006, and all distributions have been completed as of December 2008.[16]
A settlement was also completed with the Ontario Securities Commission concerning Bissett Funds in September 2005.[16]
