TIG Advisors, LLC Recognized By Absolute Return

Mar 03, 2015, 12:43 ET
		  		  					
						 from   TIG Advisors, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, March 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TIG Advisors, LLC's securitized asset strategy, which started in October 2012, was recognized in the 2014's Best Fixed Income & Mortgage Backed Securities Fund category by Hedge Fund Intelligence's Absolute Return awards. The awards ceremony was held in New York City on February 26, 2015.
Winners of the Absolute Return awards were announced at Gotham Hall, recognizing the best performing US hedge fund managers. In their research, Absolute Return emphasized the quality of returns more than the quantity. Stuart Lippman and David Liu, co-founders of the strategy, accepted the award. 
"An Absolute Return Award is a prestigious industry accolade which we're proud to accept," said David Liu, co-founder of the securitized asset strategy at TIG. "Our receiving an award for the second consecutive year is truly an honor. Being named by Absolute Return is especially pleasing as their criteria emphasize, not just overall returns, but risk-adjusted returns." 
TIG's securitized asset strategy was selected from a group of nominees based on data included in Absolute Return's comprehensive Database of US Funds. The winners were chosen on the basis of various quantitative factors, including Sharpe ratio, performance and assets.
"Our strategy builds upon TIG Advisors' 35 years of investing experience," said Stuart Lippman. "We look forward to continuing to apply our methods in order to strive to generate steady and attractive returns in 2015 and beyond."  
TIG's securitized asset strategy was started by Stuart Lippman and David Liu, who together have more than three decades of experience investing in structured products. The strategy has a relative value focus, seeking to profit from both market fundamentals and dislocations created by regulatory changes, policy issues and market technicals focusing on RMBS/CMBS/ABS securities.
About TIG AdvisorsTIG Advisors, LLC ("TIG") is an SEC registered investment adviser. Founded in 1980, the firm is engaged in the active management of alternative asset funds and their underlying businesses. The company seeks to partner with experienced and talented managers that it believes have proven and repeatable investment processes.

TIG Advisors, LLC Wins Award for Best ABS Fund

Jun 15, 2015, 09:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   TIG Advisors, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, June 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TIG Advisors, LLC and its securitized asset strategy (TSAF) won an award for Best ABS Fund for 2014 at the GlobalCapital's US Securitization Awards Dinner on June 10, 2015 at the Pierre Hotel in New York City. The award was determined by an industry wide poll in which over 80 different firms in the securitization industry participated.  "We are honored to be recognized for the second year in a row.  The award is particularly gratifying in that we were chosen by our peers and counterparties in the industry. None of this could have been achieved without the contributions of our team members and the support of the dealer community," said Stuart Lippman, chief investment officer and co-founder of the strategy at TIG.  "TSAF's performance is a testament to our team's ability to identify asymmetric opportunities, quickly enter and exit such opportunities, and use proprietary analytics to identify broader themes," said David Liu, chief strategist and co-founder of the strategy. "We will continue to strive to provide our investors long-term value by taking advantage of market dislocations within the structured credit markets."
TSAF was launched with $50MM on October 1, 2012. Today, the combined AUM of TIG's structured credit strategy is approaching $1B. The growth in AUM was driven by steady inflows and strategy performance. 
The TSAF team welcomes newest member - on June 1, Nirjhar Jain joined the TIG team as a Senior Portfolio Manager with primary focus on the CLO market. Most recently, Mr. Jain was a Managing Partner at Plus Funding Group, a specialty finance company that he co-founded and built. Prior to that, he was Head of US Securitized Credit Trading at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Jain also spent six years at Deutsche Bank where he traded various products including European Securitized Credit, ABX, Consumer ABS  and CLOs. He started his career at Lehman Brothers on the CLO Trading desk.

Strategies


TIG Advisors’ investment strategies offer proven and repeatable processes that have been applied through multiple market environments.





Each portfolio manager has the autonomy to maintain the culture, philosophy, and research capability that is distinct to their investment discipline, while drawing on the institutional infrastructure of TIG Advisors.
TIG Advisors currently manages two distinct investment strategies:


Event-Driven Global Merger Arbitrage Strategy


This strategy focuses on 0-30 day events within the merger process. The team looks to uncover complicated situations where their primary research process provides an edge and generates alpha.


Securitized Asset Strategy


This strategy focuses on relative-value trading in near-dated themes within RMBS, CMBS and ABS. The team employs three core principles of active trading, low leverage and consistent hedging in order to be agnostic to directional market trends.

TIG Advisors, LLC Recognized By Absolute Return






Mar 3, 2015, 12:43pm EST














NEW YORK, March 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TIG Advisors, LLC's securitized asset strategy, which started in October 2012, was recognized in the 2014's Best Fixed Income & Mortgage Backed Securities Fund category by Hedge Fund Intelligence's Absolute Return awards. The awards ceremony was held in New York City on February 26, 2015.
Winners of the Absolute Return awards were announced at Gotham Hall, recognizing the best performing US hedge fund managers. In their research, Absolute Return emphasized the quality of returns more than the quantity. Stuart Lippman and David Liu, co-founders of the strategy, accepted the award. 
"An Absolute Return Award is a prestigious industry accolade which we're proud to accept," said David Liu, co-founder of the securitized asset strategy at TIG. "Our receiving an award for the second consecutive year is truly an honor. Being named by Absolute Return is especially pleasing as their criteria emphasize, not just overall returns, but risk-adjusted returns." 
TIG's securitized asset strategy was selected from a group of nominees based on data included in Absolute Return's comprehensive Database of US Funds. The winners were chosen on the basis of various quantitative factors, including Sharpe ratio, performance and assets.
"Our strategy builds upon TIG Advisors' 35 years of investing experience," said Stuart Lippman. "We look forward to continuing to apply our methods in order to strive to generate steady and attractive returns in 2015 and beyond."  
TIG's securitized asset strategy was started by Stuart Lippman and David Liu, who together have more than three decades of experience investing in structured products. The strategy has a relative value focus, seeking to profit from both market fundamentals and dislocations created by regulatory changes, policy issues and market technicals focusing on RMBS/CMBS/ABS securities.
About TIG AdvisorsTIG Advisors, LLC ("TIG") is an SEC registered investment adviser. Founded in 1980, the firm is engaged in the active management of alternative asset funds and their underlying businesses. The company seeks to partner with experienced and talented managers that it believes have proven and repeatable investment processes.

Our two strategies operate with separate and autonomous investment teams in order to maintain the culture and research capability distinct to their investment philosophy. At the core, TIG Advisors’ structure provides centralized investor relations, risk management, legal and compliance, technology, global trading, treasury and collateral management, operations and accounting services.





We are committed to a culture of high integrity, transparency, and being a leader in industry best practices.





Our tenured experience of “managing the businesses of hedge funds” provides crucial insights to the strategic decisions that arise during the life cycle of a hedge fund. This teamwork allows our managers to focus on portfolio management rather than business management.
We have a diverse investor base by both geography and client type. We are dedicated to addressing the ever-changing complexities of institutional, intermediary, and high net worth investors.
