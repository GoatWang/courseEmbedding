Creating largest integrated entertainment platform for the global airline industry
Combined Company to be Renamed Global Eagle Entertainment Inc.

Leading institutional investors committing $71.25 million equity backstop
Transaction valued at 6x projected consolidated 2014 Adjusted EBITDA*
Investor conference call scheduled for 4:30pm, Thursday, November 8, 2012

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8, 2012 /PRNewswire/  Global Eagle Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ: EAGL; EAGLW; EAGLU) (Global Eagle) today announced the signing of definitive agreements under which Global Eagle will acquire Row 44, Inc. (Row 44) and approximately 86% of the issued and outstanding shares of Frankfurt-listed Advanced Inflight Alliance AG (DVN1.DE) (AIA) to create the largest entertainment and connectivity platform for the worldwide airline industry. AIA is the leading supplier of games, movies, general entertainment and applications to the airline industry, serving more than 130 airlines worldwide. Row 44 is a leading satellite-based broadband service provider to the global airline industry, with its inflight entertainment connectivity system currently installed on more than 400 aircraft that operate over land and sea worldwide. Global Eagle is a special purpose acquisition company which raised approximately $190 million in its initial public offering in May 2011. Global Eagle's founders, Harry Sloan and Jeff Sagansky, believe that this marriage of content, connectivity and capital will create a superior platform to exploit the rapidly expanding global airline industry as it increasingly focuses on the in-cabin entertainment experience and other ancillary revenue opportunities. Following the closing, Global Eagle will own 100% of the equity of Row 44 and approximately 86% of the issued and outstanding shares of AIA, and be renamed Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. Global Eagle intends to apply to list its shares of common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol "ENT."Global Eagle is purchasing the AIA shares from PAR Investment Partners, L.P. (PAR), which is also a major shareholder of Row 44. AIA separately will retain its listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (with trading of its shares in Deutsche Borse's Xetra trading system), with approximately 14% of the shares held by public shareholders.In support of this transaction, Global Eagle has arranged for leading institutional investors, including PAR, to purchase 7.125 million shares of common stock of Global Eagle to the extent any public stockholders of Global Eagle redeem their shares. In the event there are no redemptions or less than 7.125 million public shares are redeemed, the backstop investors also have an option to purchase up to a total of 7.125 million shares. The shares of common stock that PAR will receive pursuant to the Backstop Agreement may include shares of voting and non-voting Global Eagle common stock.In making the announcement, Harry Sloan, Chairman and CEO of Global Eagle, stated, "By combining AIA's access to the installed inflight entertainment market with Row 44′s WiFi to mobile device capability, Global Eagle has potential access to 100% of the airline passenger experience, creating an addressable market as large as the global airline industry. This is exactly the kind of worldwide digital media opportunity we've been seeking for Global Eagle since our IPO; and this is also a platform for Jeff and me to utilize our media and content relationships and experience to drive expansion and enhancement of inflight content and programming around the world. "Edward L. Shapiro, a partner of PAR Capital Management and Chairman of the Board of Row 44 and Chairman of AIA's Supervisory Board, who will become Chairman of Global Eagle Entertainment after the closing, stated, "We are extremely excited about this business combination. Row 44 and AIA are leaders in their respective industries and have highly complementary products and customer bases. With this transaction, not only will the two companies be able to enhance their offerings, but they will gain access to additional capital and relevant entertainment industry experience." Shapiro added, "I have had the privilege of working closely with the very talented Row 44 and AIA management teams and I look forward to continuing this work as we enter this next phase of accelerating industry adoption of wireless content delivery. I have known both Harry and Jeff for more than ten years and am eager to have them as partners as we build Global Eagle Entertainment into a leading global media company."All the members of Row 44 and AIA senior management teams, including John LaValle as CEO of Row 44 and Louis Belanger-Martin as CEO of AIA, will continue in their current positions under the new ownership structure.Summary of Business Combination TransactionUnder the terms of the proposed business combination, Global Eagle will become the owner of all of the equity of Row 44 pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement entered into today. In addition, Global Eagle will become the owner of approximately 86% of the issued and outstanding shares of AIA pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement also entered into today with PAR.Under the AIA Stock Purchase Agreement, Global Eagle will issue approximately 14,368,000 shares of non-voting common stock to PAR Capital for its 20,464,581 shares of AIA, representing a purchase price of EUR 5.50 per share and assuming a Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.27655.Pursuant to the Row 44 Merger Agreement, at the closing, Global Eagle will issue approximately 25 million shares of common stock to the equity holders of Row 44 representing a total enterprise value consideration of $250 million, subject to adjustments as defined in the Merger Agreement. Preliminarily, these adjustments are expected to result in the issuance of approximately 22.5 million shares to the equity holders of Row 44 at closing, a payment of approximately $12 million in cash to PAR, as the first party to commit to a backstop agreement, and the assumption of certain warrants. PAR currently owns approximately 86% of the issued and outstanding shares of AIA and more than 40% of the issued and outstanding equity of Row 44. AIA currently owns approximately 13% of the issued and outstanding equity of Row 44.Assuming no redemptions of Global Eagle stock by its public stockholders, the current stockholders of Global Eagle, the current owners of Row 44 (excluding PAR Capital and AIA), PAR and AIA (approximately 86% of which will be owned by Global Eagle) will hold approximately 39%, 17%, 39% and 5%, respectively, of the issued and outstanding shares of Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. common stock immediately following the closing. The cash currently held in Global Eagle's trust account will be used to fund any redemptions by public stockholders of Global Eagle of their common stock, accrued expenses and transaction expenses and fees, with any remaining cash being used for working capital and capital expenditures to facilitate growth and industry consolidation initiatives and other general corporate purposes.The boards of directors of Global Eagle and Row 44 have unanimously approved the Row 44 Merger Agreement and the board of directors of Global Eagle and PAR have each approved the sale of PAR's AIA shares. Completion of the transaction, which is expected to occur in January 2013, is subject to approval by Global Eagle and Row 44 stockholders, the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, any applicable non-U.S. antitrust approvals and other customary closing conditions.Citigroup is acting as lead capital markets advisor to Global Eagle, and BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup are providing financial advisory services to Global Eagle. RBC Capital Markets is providing advisory services to AIA. Seabury Group, LLC is providing advisory services to Row 44. Legal counsel to Global Eagle is McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Legal counsel to PAR are Goodwin Procter LLP and SJ Berwin. Legal counsel to Row 44 is Strategic Law Partners, LLP.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $150,000 as described in this prospectus. These 
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering 
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.35% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $5,025,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $5,812,500 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters 
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price 
    of the target business or businesses in our initial business combination or 
    for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of 
    operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
    interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
    The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the
    deferred underwriting commissions.

(4 These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
   of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
   we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates 
   in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based 
   upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we 
   identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific 
   regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due 
   diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our 
   staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of 
   consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not 
   anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
   fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
   fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
   category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
   the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
   account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately
   $60,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the
   trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering; however, we
   can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an
   interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current yields of securities in
   which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance
   transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, 
   our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and   
   directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we
   complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts
   out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans
   would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event
   that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
   the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
   but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned
   amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the
   post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option
   of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants  
   issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliates of our
   sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors, if any, have not been
   determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
   expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or its affiliates as we
   do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
   waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The NASDAQ rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
approximately $150.0 million (or approximately $172.5 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $5,025,000
(or up to $5,812,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in
full) of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $60,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the
principal or interest held in the trust account, except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay
our taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the
trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.
Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the
trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support beginning with the closing of this
offering. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor may loan us up to an
aggregate of $150,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
December 31, 2016 or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid
upon the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that
has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated
transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business
combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to
engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for
any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make
any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public
information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by
Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such
purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer
rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the
going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine
at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules,
the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported
pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such
purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to
which it has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder
shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial
business combination. In addition, our initial stockholder has agreed to waive
its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
its founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.

We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated on May 9, 2016 as a
Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital
stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses. We refer to


 such a business
combination throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. To
date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as
activities related to this offering. We have not identified any acquisition
target. We have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any discussions,
directly or indirectly, with respect to identifying any acquisition target. We
have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect that we will
generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business
combination.

We currently intend to concentrate our efforts in identifying businesses which
provide services to the healthcare industry, with particular emphasis on
businesses that align with several key themes: the aging of America and the
growing need for better, more efficient care for the elderly; the shift from
fee-for-service to value based care payment models; and the increasing
importance and involvement of consumers in healthcare. We are not, however,
required to complete our initial business combination with a healthcare services
business and, as a result, we may pursue a business combination outside of that
industry. We will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are
fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic
or managerial redirection to maximize value. We do not intend to acquire
start-up companies or companies that are not profitable.

Our executive offices are located at 595 East Lancaster Avenue, Suite 300,
Radnor, PA 19087 and our telephone number is (610) 229-9070.

Double Eagle Acquisition Corp (NAS:EAGL)
Accounts Receivable
=GURUF("NAS:EAGL","Accounts Receivable")

$0.00 Mil (As of Mar. 2017)
Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's accounts receivables for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 was $0.00 Mil.
Accounts receivable can be measured by Days Sales Outstanding.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0/0*91


=



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Double Eagle Acquisition Corp's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=0.007-496.922+0.75 * 0+0.5 * 0


=-496.92



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

We are offering 48,000,000 units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit. We
estimate that the net proceeds of this offering together with the funds we will
receive from the sale of the private placement warrants will be used as set
forth in the following table.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this   
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out 
    of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts   
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.                     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of           
    approximately 3.833% (or 4.05% if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full) of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and         
    concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination, up to 
    $18,400,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up
    to $22,360,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in   
    full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust     
    account. The remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay 
    all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with 
    which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness 
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the 
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will 
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting 
    discounts and commissions.             

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the $489.75 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or approximately
$561.75 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
$480 million ($10.00 per unit), or approximately $552 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will
be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and $9.75 million will be used to pay expenses in
connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following
this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $48,000
per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year. We expect that the
interest earned on funds placed in the trust account will be sufficient to pay
our income taxes. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
income taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered
in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, or
(iii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject
to the requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $15,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are
utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2015 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Each warrant would be exercisable for one-half of one Class A ordinary share.
Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of Class A ordinary shares. No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon
exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional
interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole
number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.
As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell
any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional
interest that will not be issued.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers,
advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in
privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of
our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated 
herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such 
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase 
shares or public warrants in such transaction. If they engage in such 
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession 
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider
trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing our
securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of
any material non-public information and (ii) clear all trades with our legal
counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders
will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent
upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such
purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such
purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not
necessary.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a
closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business
combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met.
The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the
number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters
submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial
business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the
completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our
Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial
holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to
maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that
such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed 
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with 
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination 
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust 
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial 
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands
exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to


 throughout this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not selected any
business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf,
initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business
combination target.

We will seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and
operating expertise of our management team to select, acquire and operate media
or entertainment businesses, including providers of content, with high growth 
potential in the United States or internationally, although we may pursue 
acquisition opportunities in other sectors. Our amended and restated memorandum 
and articles of association prohibits us from effectuating a business 
combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal 
operations.
