Avant made me feel like a valued customer and I feel empowered to chart my own path after receiving my loan through Avant. Many many thanks.

Mark W., Summerville, SC





The experience with Avant was great, very easy to apply and the customer service individual that helped me with the process was outstanding.

— LMae A., Jackson, SC





Avant allows a loan to be paid early with no additional penalties. Thats really unheard of. Thanks again!

— Brian S., San Diego, CA





I was impressed with the convenience and very helpful customer service. The approval process was streamlined and not complicated. I had been declined by my local bank for a personal loan, I am very grateful to Avant!

— Gladys F., Los Angeles, CA





The process was smooth and I received my funds the very next business day. I would highly recommend Avant to anyone looking for financial assistance.

— Daryl D., Lynn, MA





Avant was very nice, very efficient, very quick and very reasonable with the interest rate.

— Patty T., Wharton, TX







Very user-friendly service and quick response time. The agent on the phone stayed with me until my application was complete. This expedited the process and gave me confidence. He was well equipped to answer my questions. Also, my loan was paid out the next day. That was fabulous. Again, a no hassle experience!

— Heidi I., Chicago, IL





The customer service rep that I spoke to was awesome. He verified my identity and the money was in the bank the very next morning. It was an easy and awesome experience. Thank you for being there for me.

— Irma I., Bryan, TX





Recently I had a emergency and needed to get help quick. I went to their website which was clear and informative, filled out the quick and easy application and their representative were courteous, quick, and very helpful. In no time at all I had the check in my account. Thank you Avant for being there.

— Lois M., Chicago, IL





We are using the money to pay for the expenses involved with adopting a sixteen year old daughter who came from a very troubled family. It was certainly something we hadn't budgeted for but when we heard her story we knew what we had to do. The loan through Avant allowed us to cover the costs of furniture, lawyers, and everything else necessary to complete the adoption.

— David S., Queen Creek, AZ

Loans for Many Purposes | Avant



































































Loan Uses












A personal loan through Avant can be used for almost any situation. Whether you are looking for a simple way to consolidate your debt, planning a home improvement project or dealing with an unexpected life event.  Avant may be able to help, right when you need it the most.

Debt Consolidation
Debt Consolidation Loans
Consolidate one or more unsecured debts – such as your credit card balances – into one, easy-to-manage monthly payment. Unlike some other products, loans through Avant have a fixed interest rate and a set term.
Home Improvement
Home Improvement Loans
When you have loans through Avant, you don’t have to use your savings, or even the equity in your home, to fund your home improvement projects. You are free to make whatever repairs or renovations your home needs.
Unexpected Expenses
Emergency Loans
Avant may make it easier to deal with the unexpected. While there are things no one can plan for, receiving a loan through Avant and having the funds deposited directly into your bank account can help ease your burden during times of emergency.

Avant Diagnostics, Inc. Key Developments

Avant Diagnostics Enters into Option Agreement with Genetic Health Solution
Jul 12 17
Avant Diagnostics, Inc. has entered into an exclusive option agreement with Genetic Health Solution for the patient-delivery technology platform, which helps chronic disease patient management. Pursuant to the agreement, Avant Diagnostics acquired an exclusive option to license the patient-delivery technology platform from Genetic Health Solution. As part of the agreement, the management teams of both companies will endeavor to build an oncology-focused personalized health optimization program to improve health outcomes for patients based upon oncology drugs' side effect profiles combined with advanced blood biomarker monitoring. Taken together, the companies believe they can establish a personalized cancer patient management program tailored to allow physicians and patients to proactively mitigate potential negative drug side effects, as well as boost overall health. Concurrently, Avant Diagnostics is evaluating an initial Theralink product launch in breast cancer that will focus on a specific treatment paradigm where the company proprietary assay can immediately impact a large population of patients who may be prescribed ineffective treatments due to the insufficient biomarker testing methods currently available.


Avant Diagnostics Announces Confirmatory Clinical Utility Data for Theralink® in Pancreatic Cancer
Jun 27 17
Avant Diagnostics, Inc. announced positive clinical utility data, the confirmation of the clinical utility of the Theralink® Pancreatic Cancer assay in an expanded 60 patient data study in distinguishing patients that will experience a 5-year survival outcome following standard of care treatment regimens, versus those likely to experience significantly worse outcomes. The initial 40 patient study set was presented at The International Symposium on Pancreas Cancer 2016. The Company is evaluating the commercial potential of this assay to assist physicians in making prescribing decisions, as well as helping pharmaceutical companies and research institutions to develop novel treatment paradigms for pancreatic cancer. Methods: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 40 pts (20 pts each with long-term actual disease-free OS [median 65 mo, range 26-137 mo] [LTS] and with early relapse/death < 2 yrs [STS]) with de novo resected PDAC formed the test cohort. All pts received adjuvant Rx (chemo Rx with/without chemoradiation). Laser Capture Microdissection enabled directed cancer and stromal cell isolation. Retrospective blinded protein activation analysis for both was performed via Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA). Differences in baseline protein signaling of LTS vs. STS were evaluated via two-way ANOVA analysis. Results: Analysis of > 50 signal transduction proteins (STPs) for activation (phosphorylation) showed these significant differences for LTS vs. STS in cancer cells: 1) Activation of proliferation markers Sox2/Ki 67 were higher (p<0.0001). 2) Activation of anti-apoptotic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT 3) (p=0.047) and p-SRC kinase (p=0.039) were higher. 3) Activated p-m-TOR expression was higher (p=0.021). 4) Activation of mitotic marker histone H3S10 was lower (p=0.03). In stromal cells, activation of the survival marker Mek S298 was lower (p=0.021). For other STPs, differences for LTS vs. STS (e.g. Livin, PCNA) were not seen. Conclusions: LTS and STS of de novo resected PDAC show clear differences in cancer cell protein activation re-key markers of proliferation and apoptosis (Sox2, Ki67, STAT3, SRC kinase, H3S10). For stromal cells, protein activation was largely similar, but a difference in activation of one stromal protein (Mek S298) was seen. For these pts, differences in protein activation prior to adjuvant Rx could enhance current prognostic models and/or identify new pharmacological targets designed to improve OS. These findings require further validation: a second 60 sample validation cohort is now under analysis.

The Theralink assay technology uses reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology to measure the quantity, activity and downstream signaling pathway activation levels for receptors of FDA-approved and investigational drugs in order to determine whether or not a prescribed medication is likely to be effective in treating the cancer of a specific patient at that moment in time.This highly sensitive analysis empowers physicians to make better treatment decisions by giving a greater degree of certainty as to whether a specific drug will work in treating a specific patient, as well as informing a physician whether a chemotherapy treatment is unlikely to be effective. This information potentially allows the patient to forego the devastating side effects of cytotoxic treatments that are unlikely to deliver clinically meaningful benefit, while guiding physicians to prescribing treatments likely to yield maximum benefit. Theralink measures phosphorylated proteins in tumor tissue. Phosphorylated proteins represent active targets for drugs.

OvaDx (tm) diagnostic blood test for ovarian cancer
Ovarian cancer is known as the “silent killer” due to its often being identified during its later stages. Early stage symptoms are often ignored, but early detection has a 5-year survivability rate of 93%. Late stage symptoms are more easily detected, but have a 5-year survivability rate of 18%. OvaDx is in early stage development as a potential replacement to CA-125.
LymPro Test(tm)
The LymPro Test is a blood test for Alzheimer's disease that measures immune system dysfunction in the blood that is indicative of a likely Alzheimer's diagnosis. LymPro is currently being evaluated as an early-stage diagnostic screening test for Alzheimer's disease, and is also being evaluated in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) that results from chronic sub-concussive blows to the brain.

Genetic Health Solution platform helps chronic disease patient management
Patient-centric biomarker-based wellness programs designed to improve outcomes









Avant Diagnostics, Inc. ("Avant") (OTC: AVDX), an oncology-focused Healthcare-IT company commercializing the proprietary Theralink® phospho-protein biomarker platform across multiple cancers, acquired an exclusive option to license the patient-delivery technology platform from Genetic Health Solution ("GHS", website: http://www.genetichealthsolution.com). GHS is a functional medicine practice that specializes in the aggregation and analysis of advanced biomarker testing data to provide tailored product recommendations for health optimization.
As part of the agreement, the management teams of both companies will endeavor to build an oncology-focused personalized health optimization program to improve health outcomes for patients based upon oncology drugs' side effect profiles combined with advanced blood biomarker monitoring. Taken together, the companies believe they can establish a best-in-class personalized cancer patient management program tailored to allow physicians and patients to proactively mitigate potential negative drug side effects, as well as boost overall health.
Concurrent with this announcement, the Company is evaluating an initial Theralink® product launch in breast cancer that will focus on a specific treatment paradigm where our proprietary assay can immediately impact a large population of patients who may be prescribed ineffective treatments due to the insufficient biomarker testing methods currently available. The patient population of interest, with the additional Theralink information, would receive a different prescription therapy that is likely to lead to a well-defined improvement in outcomes based upon the published literature.

If you are affiliated with this page and would like it removed please contact pressreleases@franklyinc.comSOURCE  Avant Diagnostics, Inc.GAITHERSBURG, Maryland, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Two thirds of all breast cancer (BC) tumors are estrogen receptor positive (ER)+ER+ BC patients have mixed responses to endocrine therapyResearch demonstrates mTOR pathway activation status prospectively predicts endocrine therapy treatment responseAvant Diagnostics, Inc. ("Avant") (OTC: AVDX), an oncology-focused healthcare technology company commercializing the proprietary Theralink® phospho-protein biomarker platform across multiple cancers, today highlighted independent published literature that provides critical validation for the clinical utility of the Company's proprietary Theralink® mTOR phosphoprotein assay in segmenting the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) population by mTOR activation status. The data, published in multiple journals by leading independent research groups, demonstrates that ER+ BC patients whose tumors had highly activated mTOR pathway who were treated with anti-endocrine therapy such as Tamoxifen® are likely to exhibit treatment resistance, whereas patients whose tumors had low levels of mTOR pathway activation are likely to respond to treatment. Taken together, the data provides a compelling case for physicians treating ER+ BC patients to seek-out mTOR pathway activation status prior to initiating ER hormone therapy."The body of evidence regarding endocrine therapy treatment outcomes for ER+ breast cancer patients based upon mTOR pathway activation status as measured by activation of specific mTOR kinase substrates is compelling," said Emanuel Petricoin, PhD, Co-Director of the Center for Applied Proteomics and Molecular Medicine (CAPMM) at George Mason University. "The data provides a strong rationale for physicians to seek-out mTOR pathway activation status as measured by protein phosphorylation of specific mTOR kinase substrates as part of the standard biomarker profiling paradigm in this patient population. The mTOR pathway activation assay licensed to Avant by George Mason University is patent protected and provides a significant barrier to entry so that Avant can commercialize this technology with the appropriate strategic plan under newly-appointed President & CEO Dr. Philippe Goix's leadership."Avant has developed an analytically and clinically validated mTOR-pathway activation-focused assay that measures the activation state of specific mTOR protein kinases such as p70S6 and 4EBP1 that indicate mTOR pathway activation and endocrine resistance in the ER+ BC patient population. The Company's mTOR pathway activation assay is protected by the issued US patent #8,628,931 that describes predicting a response to chemotherapy based upon the assay. The Company is evaluating strategic options for commercially launching the assay."This data provides further evidence that we, as a medical community, can push precision medicine to higher levels," said Brian Harvey, Former Director of the Division of Gastroenterology Products at the Center for Drug Evaluation Research at the FDA. "Testing that optimizes treatment for each individual patient is the ultimate clinical goal."mTOR prognostic data for Tamoxifen response in ER+ Breast Cancer from  five publications Karlsson et al. Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R96The mTOR effectors 4EBP1 and S6K2 are frequently coexpressed, and associated with a poor prognosis and endocrine resistance in breast cancer: a retrospective study including patients from the  randomized Stockholm tamoxifen trials   Elin Karlsson1*, Gizeh Pérez-Tenorio1, Risul Amin1, Josefine Bostner1, Lambert Skoog2, Tommy Fornander3, Dennis C Sgroi4, Bo Nordenskjöld1, Anna-Lotta Hallbeck1 and Olle Stål1Abstract Introduction: mTOR and its downstream effectors the 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and the p70 ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) are frequently upregulated in breast cancer, and assumed to be driving forces in tumourigenesis, in close connection with estrogen receptor (ER) networks. Here, we investigated these factors as clinical markers in five different cohorts of breast cancer patients.Methods: The prognostic significance of 4EBP1, S6K1 and S6K2 mRNA expression was assessed with real-time PCR in 93 tumours from the treatment randomized Stockholm trials, encompassing postmenopausal patients enrolled between 1976 and 1990. Three publicly available breast cancer cohorts were used to confirm the results. Furthermore, the predictive values of 4EBP1 and p4EBP1_S65 protein expression for both prognosis and endocrine treatment benefit were assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of 912 node-negative breast cancers from the Stockholm trials.Results: S6K2 and 4EBP1 mRNA expression levels showed significant correlation and were associated with a poor outcome in all cohorts investigated. 4EBP1 protein was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor, especially in progesterone receptor (PgR)-expressing cancers. 4EBP1 protein expression was also associated with a poor response to endocrine treatment in the ER/PgR positive group. Cross-talk to genomic as well as non-genomic ER/PgR signaling may be involved and the results further support a combination of ER and mTOR signaling targeted therapies.Conclusion: This study suggests S6K2 and 4EBP1 as important factors for breast tumourigenesis, interplaying with hormone receptor signaling. We propose S6K2 and 4EBP1 as new potential clinical markers for prognosis and endocrine therapy response in breast cancer.  2.Beelen et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R6Phosphorylated p-70S6K predicts tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal breast cancer patients randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen versus no systemic treatment  Karin Beelen1, Mark Opdam1, Tesa M Severson1, Rutger HT Koornstra1, Andrew D Vincent2, Jelle Wesseling3, Jettie J Muris3, Els MJJ Berns4, Jan B Vermorken5, Paul J van Diest6 and Sabine C Linn1,6,7*Abstract   Introduction: Activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and/or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways results in anti-estrogen resistance in vitro, but a biomarker with clinical validity to predict intrinsic resistance has not been identified. In metastatic breast cancer patients with previous exposure to endocrine therapy, the addition of a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor has been shown to be beneficial. Whether or not patients on adjuvant endocrine treatment might benefit from these drugs is currently unclear. A biomarker that predicts intrinsic resistance could potentially be used as companion diagnostic in this setting. We tested the clinical validity of different downstream-activated proteins in the PI3K and/or MAPK pathways to predict intrinsic tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal primary breast cancer patients.Methods: We recollected primary tumor tissue from patients who participated in a randomized trial of adjuvant tamoxifen (1-3 years) versus observation. After constructing a tissue micro-array, cores from 563 estrogen receptor a positive were immunostained for p-AKT(Thr308), p-AKT(Ser473), p-mTOR, p-p706SK and p-ERK1/2. Cox proportional hazard models for recurrence free interval were used to assess hazard ratios and interactions between these markers and tamoxifen treatment efficacy.Results: Interactions were identified between tamoxifen and p-AKT(Thr308), p-mTOR, p-p70S6K and p-ERK1/2. Applying a conservative level of significance, p-p70S6K remained significantly associated with tamoxifen resistance. Patients with p-p70S6K negative tumors derived significant benefit from tamoxifen (HR 0.24, P<0.0001), while patients whose tumor did express p-p70S6K did not (HR=1.02, P =0.95), P for interaction 0.004. In systemically untreated breast cancer patients, p-p70S6K was associated with a decreased risk for recurrence. Conclusions: Patients whose tumor expresses p-p70S6K, as a marker of downstream PI3K and/or MAPK pathway activation, have a favorable prognosis, but do not benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen. A potential benefit from inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in these patients needs to be further explored.  3.Jordan et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R12Impact of dual mTORC1/2 mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 on acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer in vitro   Nicola J Jordan1,4, Carol M Dutkowski1, Denise Barrow1, Huw J Mottram1, Iain R Hutcheson2, Robert I Nicholson1, Sylvie M Guichard3 and Julia MW Gee1*Abstract   Introduction: Upregulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in endocrine-resistant breast cancer (BC) has identified mTOR as an attractive target alongside anti-hormones to control resistance. RAD001 (everolimus/Afinitor®), an allosteric mTOR inhibitor, is proving valuable in this setting; however, some patients are inherently refractory or relapse during treatment requiring alternative strategies. Here we evaluate the potential for novel dual mTORC1/2 mTOR kinase inhibitors, exemplified by AZD8055, by comparison with RAD001 in ER+ endocrine resistant BC cells.Methods: In vitro models of tamoxifen (TamR) or estrogen deprivation resistance (MCF7-X) were treated with RAD001 or AZD8055 alone or combined with anti-hormone fulvestrant. Endpoints included growth, cell proliferation (Ki67), viability and migration, with PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling impact monitored by Western blotting. Potential ER cross-talk was investigated by immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR.Results: RAD001 was a poor growth inhibitor of MCF7-derived Tamer and MCF7-X cells (IC50 =1 µM), rapidly inhibiting mTORC1 but not mTORC2/AKT signaling. In contrast AZD8055, which rapidly inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2/AKT activity, was a highly effective (P<0.001) growth inhibitor of TamR (IC50 18nM) and MCF7-X (IC50 24 nM), and of a further T47D-derived tamoxifen resistant model T47D-tamR (IC50 19 nM). AZD8055 significantly (P<0.05) inhibited resistant cell proliferation, increased cell death and reduced migration. Furthermore, dual treatment of TamR or MCF7-X cells with AZD8055 plus fulvestrant provided superior control of resistant growth versus either agent alone (P<0.05). Co-treating with AZD8055 alongside tamoxifen (P<0.01) or estrogen deprivation (P<0.05) also effectively inhibited endocrine responsive MCF-7 cells. Although AZD8055 inhibited estrogen receptor (ER) ser167 phosphorylation in TamR and MCF7-X, it had no effect on ER ser118 activity or expression of several ER-regulated genes, suggesting the mTOR kinase inhibitor impact was largely ER-independent. The capacity of AZD8055 for ER-independent activity was further evidenced by growth inhibition (IC5018 and 20 nM) of two acquired fulvestrant resistant models lacking ER. Conclusions: This is the first report demonstrating dual mTORC1/2 mTOR kinase inhibitors have potential to control acquired endocrine resistant BC, even under conditions where everolimus fails. Such inhibitors may prove of particular benefit when used alongside anti-hormonal treatment as second-line therapy in endocrine resistant disease, and also potentially alongside anti-hormones during the earlier endocrine responsive phase to hinder development of resistance.  4.Breast Cancer Res Treat (2013) 137:397-406Activation of Akt, mTOR, and the estrogen receptor as a signature to predict tamoxifen treatment bene?t Jose?ne Bostner, Elin Karlsson, Muneeswaran J. Pandiyan, Hanna Westman, Lambert Skoog, Tommy Fornander, Bo Nordenskjo, Olle StalAbstract   The frequent alterations of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR growth signaling pathway are proposed mechanisms for resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer, partly through regulation of estrogen receptor a (ER) activity. Reliable biomarkers for treatment prediction are required for improved individualized treatment. We performed a retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of primary tumors from 912 postmenopausal patients with node-negative breast cancer, randomized to either tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment. Phosphorylated (p)Akt-serine(s)473,p-mTOR-s2448, and ER phosphorylations-s167 and -s305 were evaluated as potential biomarkers of prognosis and tamoxifen treatment ef?cacy. High expression of p-mTOR indicated a reduced response to tamoxifen, most pronounced in the ER+/progesterone receptor (PgR) + subgroup (tamoxifen vs. no tamoxifen: hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; 95 % con?dence interval (CI), 0.31-2.38; P = 0.78), whereas low p-mTOR expression predicted tamoxifen bene?t (HR, 0.29; 95 % CI, 0.18-0.49;P = 0.000002). In addition, nuclear p-Akt-s473 as well as p-ER at -s167 and/or -s305 showed interaction with tamoxifen ef?cacy with borderline statistical signi?cance. A combination score of positive pathway markers including p-Akt, p-mTOR, and p-ER showed signi?cant association with tamoxifen bene?t (test for interaction; P = 0.029). Cross-talk between growth signaling pathways and ER-signaling has been proposed to affect tamoxifen response in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The results support this hypothesis, as an overactive pathway was signi?cantly associated with reduced response to Tamoxifen. A clinical pretreatment test for cross-talk markers would be a step toward individualized adjuvant endocrine treatment with or without the addition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitors.  5.Beelen et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R13PIK3CA mutations, phosphatase and tensin homolog, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and adjuvant tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal breast cancer patients   Karin Beelen1, Mark Opdam1, Tesa M Severson1, Rutger HT Koornstra1, Andrew D Vincent2, Jelle Wesseling3, Jettie J Muris3, Els MJJ Berns4, Jan B Vermorken5, Paul J van Diest6 and Sabine C Linn1,6,7*Abstract   Introduction: Inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) pathway can overcome endocrine resistance in estrogen receptor (ER) a-positive breast cancer, but companion diagnostics indicating PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation and consequently endocrine resistance are lacking. PIK3CA mutations frequently occur in ERa-positive breast cancer and result in PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation in vitro. Nevertheless, the prognostic and treatment-predictive value of these mutations in ERa-positive breast cancer is contradictive. We tested the clinical validity of PIK3CA mutations and other canonic pathway drivers to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen. In addition, we tested the association between these drivers and downstream activated proteins.Methods: Primary tumors from 563 ERa-positive postmenopausal patients, randomized between adjuvant tamoxifen (1 to 3 years) versus observation were recollected. PIK3CA hotspot mutations in exon 9 and exon 20 were assessed with Sequenom Mass Spectrometry. Immunohistochemistry was performed for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). We tested the association between these molecular alterations and downstream activated proteins (like phospho-protein kinase B (p-AKT), phospho-mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), p-ERK1/2, and p-p70S6K). Recurrence-free interval improvement with tamoxifen versus control was assessed according to the presence or absence of canonic pathway drivers, by using Cox proportional hazard models, including a test for interaction.Results: PIK3CA mutations (both exon 9 and exon 20) were associated with low tumor grade. An enrichment of PIK3CA exon 20 mutations was observed in progesterone receptor- positive tumors. PIK3CA exon 20 mutations were not associated with downstream-activated proteins. No significant interaction between PIK3CA mutations or any of the other canonic pathway drivers and tamoxifen-treatment benefit was found.Conclusion: PIK3CA mutations do not have clinical validity to predict intrinsic resistance to adjuvant tamoxifen and may therefore be unsuitable as companion diagnostic for PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors in ERa- positive, postmenopausal, early breast cancer patients.About Avant Diagnostics, Inc. Avant is a healthcare information solutions company that specializes in biomarker tests that are being developed in the areas of oncology and neurology. Avant provides personalized medicine diagnostic testing capabilities through its TheraLink® diagnostic assays, initially for breast cancer, to assist clinical oncologists in identifying likely responders for over 30 FDA-approved drug treatment regimens.

IntroductionArrayit Corporation and Avant Diagnostics, Inc. have developed a advanced monitoring test for ovarian cancer diagnostics.
Quality ControlThe Arrayit Corporation and Avant Diagnostics, Inc. OvaDx® test is manufactured using the highest level of quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) available. Quality control and quality assurance of each manufactured test ensures that OvaDx® performance will meet or exceed the highest diagnostics standards.
Test DescriptionOvaDx® is an advanced microarray-based diagnostic test that measures the activation of the immune system in response to ovarian tumor cell development. Patient sera are applied to OvaDx® microarrays to allow binding between proteomic biomarkers in the patient samples and capture agents on the microarrays. The microarrays are washed and scanned to produce a digital readout for each serum sample, and the data are quantified and analyzed in software to generate the test results. Clinicians will appreciate the following feaures of this product:

Specificity determined by screening 178 samples from healthy patients and 10 samples from patients with benign gynecological conditions
100% specificity based on 188 of 188 non-OVC samples scored as negative
Identifies stage I, II, III and IV disease markers in patient samples
Detects stage IA disease markers with ~80% sensitivity
Detects borderline serous, clear cell, endometrioid, mixed epithelial, mucinous, serous, and ovarian adenocarcinoma in patient sera
Multi-plexed microarray assay reads approximately 100 proteomic biomarkers
Proteomic panel provides definitive real-time test results
Microarray format reduces serum requirement to 0.1-0.25 ml per sample run
Blood cards can be used for sample collection

Automated process permits large-scale (e.g. 1,000,000 sample+) screening
Supplement OVA1® and other multi-analyte tests
Supplement single marker tests including cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) and human epididymis protein (HE4)
Supplement genetic tests including BRCA1 and BRCA2
Supplement imaging techniques including transvaginal ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT) scans, and x-rays
Screen patient sera from breast, cervical, uterine and other cancer patients
Test samples from patients with ovarian cysts and other benign conditions

OvaDx® Blood Cards. Patient samples for OvaDx® diagnostic testing can be submitted using Arrayit Corporation blood cards. Place 5 large drops of fresh patient blood inside the red box of a new card. Arrayit’s unique competitive linear transfer chromotography technology partitions the whole blood components from left to right such that the serum containing the OvaDx® biomarkers separates cleanly from the red blood cells in 1 minute. Please allow the card to dry for 10 minutes prior to mailing. Dried cards should be placed in the airtight mailing envelopes supplied with the sampling kit and mailed to our Sunnyvale laboratories for testing.
Patient SamplesFresh blood (0.5-1.0 ml) should be drawn intravenously and collected in a red-top tube with no additive. Samples should be centrifuged immediately for 5 min at 6,000 rpm (2,000 x g) to isolate the serum fraction (top layer). The serum (0.1-0.25 ml) should be transferred to a fresh microfuge tube or sample vial and frozen immediately at -20�C or -70�C. Previously prepared samples stored at -20�C or -70�C are also acceptable. Blood samples can also be collected using blood cards provided by Avant Diagnostics, Inc. Samples should be labeled unambiguously with a permanent marker, adhesive label or by barcoding. Frozen Samples should be shipped overnight on dry ice with sample annotation and complete clinician contact information and blood cards should be shipped at room temperature:

Troubleshooting Tips

Serum samples appear cloudy: make certain to centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 5 min
Blood cards lack sufficient serum: collect at least 4-5 drops of blood
Serum samples have insufficient protein concentration: make certain to use undiluted whole blood
Assays show high background: top serum layer should be transferred to a new tube immediately after centrifugation
Positive controls fail: re-test using new serum samples
Negative controls fail: re-test using new serum samples

Avant Diagnostics, Inc. Begins OvaDx FDA Trials and Engages Clinical 
      Research Organization






April 15, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Avant 
      Diagnostics, Inc. (OTCBB: AVDX) (“Avant”), a diagnostic company with 
      a primary focus on the commercialization of a proprietary diagnostic 
      test for the early detection of ovarian cancer called OvaDx®, is pleased 
      to announce that it has engaged the professional services of DOCRO, Inc. 
      (“DOCRO”) to manage the preparation and the submission of the 
      pre-submission package for OvaDx® and to conduct the negotiation with 
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) office for the process for 
      obtaining a 510(k) clearance of the OvaDx® device intended for use as an 
      aid in monitoring women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Additionally, 
      Avant purchased the necessary ovarian cancer samples required for the 
      supervised, double blinded clinical validation testing data to be 
      included in the pre-submission package.
    


      Gregg Linn, Avant’s President and Chief Executive Officer, noted, “I am 
      thrilled finally to reach this milestone. Since I joined the company 
      almost 2½ years ago, my goal was simply to take OvaDx® through the FDA 
      submission process for ovarian cancer monitoring, seek FDA clearance, 
      and most importantly, save lives.”
    

About Avant Diagnostics, Inc.


      Avant Diagnostics, Inc. is a medical diagnostic technology company that 
      specializes in large panel biomarker screening. Our first test, OvaDx®, 
      developed in conjunction with Arrayit Corporation (OTCQB: ARYC), detects 
      for pre-symptomatic ovarian cancer. OvaDx® is a sophisticated 
      microarray-based test that measures the activation of the immune system 
      in blood samples in response to early stage ovarian tumor cell 
      development. Pre-clinical research studies with OvaDx® indicated 
      high sensitivity and specificity for all types and stages of ovarian 
      cancer, including stage IA-IV borderline serous, clear cell, 
      endometrioid, mixed epithelial, mucinous, serous, and ovarian 
      adenocarcinoma. Upon FDA 510(k) clearance, Avant intends to sell or 
      license OvaDx® as a diagnostic test for women seeking greater 
      wellness and for women in the elevated risk category for ovarian cancer.

Avant made me feel like a valued customer and I feel empowered to chart my own path after receiving my loan through Avant. Many many thanks.

Mark W., Summerville, SC





The experience with Avant was great, very easy to apply and the customer service individual that helped me with the process was outstanding.

— LMae A., Jackson, SC





Avant allows a loan to be paid early with no additional penalties. Thats really unheard of. Thanks again!

— Brian S., San Diego, CA





I was impressed with the convenience and very helpful customer service. The approval process was streamlined and not complicated. I had been declined by my local bank for a personal loan, I am very grateful to Avant!

— Gladys F., Los Angeles, CA





The process was smooth and I received my funds the very next business day. I would highly recommend Avant to anyone looking for financial assistance.

— Daryl D., Lynn, MA





Avant was very nice, very efficient, very quick and very reasonable with the interest rate.

— Patty T., Wharton, TX







Very user-friendly service and quick response time. The agent on the phone stayed with me until my application was complete. This expedited the process and gave me confidence. He was well equipped to answer my questions. Also, my loan was paid out the next day. That was fabulous. Again, a no hassle experience!

— Heidi I., Chicago, IL





The customer service rep that I spoke to was awesome. He verified my identity and the money was in the bank the very next morning. It was an easy and awesome experience. Thank you for being there for me.

— Irma I., Bryan, TX





Recently I had a emergency and needed to get help quick. I went to their website which was clear and informative, filled out the quick and easy application and their representative were courteous, quick, and very helpful. In no time at all I had the check in my account. Thank you Avant for being there.

— Lois M., Chicago, IL





We are using the money to pay for the expenses involved with adopting a sixteen year old daughter who came from a very troubled family. It was certainly something we hadn't budgeted for but when we heard her story we knew what we had to do. The loan through Avant allowed us to cover the costs of furniture, lawyers, and everything else necessary to complete the adoption.

— David S., Queen Creek, AZ

Loans for Many Purposes | Avant



































































Loan Uses












A personal loan through Avant can be used for almost any situation. Whether you are looking for a simple way to consolidate your debt, planning a home improvement project or dealing with an unexpected life event.  Avant may be able to help, right when you need it the most.

Debt Consolidation
Debt Consolidation Loans
Consolidate one or more unsecured debts – such as your credit card balances – into one, easy-to-manage monthly payment. Unlike some other products, loans through Avant have a fixed interest rate and a set term.
Home Improvement
Home Improvement Loans
When you have loans through Avant, you don’t have to use your savings, or even the equity in your home, to fund your home improvement projects. You are free to make whatever repairs or renovations your home needs.
Unexpected Expenses
Emergency Loans
Avant may make it easier to deal with the unexpected. While there are things no one can plan for, receiving a loan through Avant and having the funds deposited directly into your bank account can help ease your burden during times of emergency.
