His prior law firm experience includes serving as Of Counsel in the litigation and telecommunications departments at Swidler & Berlin in Washington, DC and Of Counsel in the business litigation department at Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough in Charlotte. He earned his Juris Doctor, cum laude, in 1986 from New York Law School.
