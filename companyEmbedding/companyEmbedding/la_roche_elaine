What is the Skin Barrier?
Skin has a barrier which acts as the body’s first line of defense against external aggressors. It also helps retain essential moisture. Constant exposure to elements such as UV rays, pollution & stress can weaken the skin barrier.











Replenish Moisture
Keeping skin hydrated is key for healthy looking skin. Ingredients such as Glycerin and water can replenish moisture. La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water has a unique combination of minerals & trace elements to soothe & hydrate skin.











Help Restore the Skin Barrier
Ceramides are a key component of skin. They help to make up the skin barrier and lock in moisture. Ceramides are naturally lost, which can contribute to dry skin. Replenishing these essential lipids is important for maintaining a strong skin barrier.




















NEW Toleriane Daily Moisturizers and Cleansers!

Introducing a new generation of cleansers and moisturizers that work together to help restore healthy looking skin. These gentle formulas replenish moisture and help restore skin’s natural protective barrier.
The new Toleriane products are formulated with La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water, lipid-replenishing Ceramide-3, soothing Niacinamide, and moisturizing Glycerin.
Developed under a stringent formulation charter: oil free, non comedogenic, fragrance free, paraben free, soap and sulfate-free cleansers, allergy tested, dermatologist tested, and suitable for sensitive skin.

The key to La Roche-Posay products is a natural stream flowing through France. The water from this spring has been used in Europe for decades to treat patients with chronic skin diseases including eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and burns. This patented Thermal Spring Water is at the heart of La Roche-Posay products and delivers numerous benefits for the skin. 
Thermal Spring Water has a unique composition that is high in essential nutrients including selenium, zinc and copper. Researchers in France realized its potential for healing skin and relieving irritation, itching, redness and inflammation associated with chronic skin conditions. The soothing and healing properties of this ingredient make La Roche-Posay products ideal for anyone who suffers from acne, sensitive skin, eczema or psoriasis. Each year, over 8,000 patients are treated at the thermal dermatology institute where the La Roche-Posay products are developed.
La Roche-Posay products are tested according to the highest scientific standards for their tolerance on extremely sensitive skin. All formulas are allergy-tested and non-comedogenic which means they are safe for all skin types. The brand offers products for everyone with lines formulated to target acne, rosacea, signs of aging and hyperpigmentation. The products are the winners of numerous consumer and beauty industry awards making them some of the most widely recommended products available.
Choose La Roche-Posay products infused with Thermal Spring Water to heal and protect your skin.

La Roche posay anthelios ultra light 60 sunscreen fluid

I love this sunscreen. It is very light on my face and really protects from sunburn. I only wish it wasn't so expensive for such a small amount so I could use all over and not just on my face.

La Roche-Posay


The Magical Properties of Thermal Spring Water Unique selenium-rich thermal spring water can be found at the heart of a small village in central France called La Roche Posay. This mineral-rich water flows through La Roche-Posay's skincare formulas. The trace mineral selenium helps to support the skin's defence mechanisms and assists in the battle against the damage caused by free radicals. Thermal spring water helps treat certain serious inflammatory skin conditions when used as a therapeutic complement. It has been recognized for its beneficial properties for centuries and now, modern scientific research can explain the components that make this element so valuable.A Commitment to Better SkinLa Roche-Posay is known as the sensitive skin experts. Trust in the years of research that inform this French brand and try the sensitive skin range for yourself. Meanwhile no other suncare collection will protect you in the way La-Roche Posay's Anthelios range does.Found in pharmacies in France and dermatologist offices, La Roche-Posay treatments are formulated in line with two fundamental principles: high standards and dermatological safety. All of their highly concentrated formulas are hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic, fragrance-free and are tightly packaged under sterile conditions.La Roche Posay works closely with dermatologists to ensure that every product in the range is kind to sensitive skin while delivering visible improvements in the appearance and condition of the complexion. Targeted treatments help to boost particularly sensitive areas, such as the lips and eyes.Effective SolutionsThere are so many, with La Roche-Posay. For example the mobility of the skin around the eyes leaves it vulnerable to wrinkling; by applying an eye cream every morning and evening, you can help the skin remain firm, supple and resistant to wrinkles. For intense support turn to La Roche Posay Redermic C Eyes Anti-Wrinkle Firming Moisturizing Filler which contains hyaluronic acid and pure vitamin C. This rich eye cream smooth's and plumps the skin that surrounds the eyes.We forget that our skin is an organ, and it must be looked after daily. Skin protects our vital organs, shields our skeleton, and offers protection from harmful environmental factors. Our skin takes a beating on a daily basis and is entitled to pampering without special occasion. Whether you want to treat your skin or need dermatologist quality products, La Roche Posay Products has what you need.

About La Roche-Posay



La Roche-Posay treatments consist of two fundamental principles: high standards and dermatological safety. La Roche-Posay products contain thermal spring water combined with a minimum, but optimum, concentration of selective ingredients. Our Anthelios and Effaclar line is extremely popular for suncare and acne treatment. The formulas are developed such that their concentration of ingredients within their skin care products are very gentle on the skin, while remaining totally effective. The tests developed by La Roche-Posay Pharmaceutical Laboratory are among the cosmetics industry's most demanding in order to ensure optimum safety. Each product must demonstrate its effectiveness according to strict criteria; namely, a visible result, confirmed by a dermatologist, and effectiveness that is scientifically measured against a placebo or a reference product.

What is the Skin Barrier?
Skin has a barrier which acts as the body’s first line of defense against external aggressors. It also helps retain essential moisture. Constant exposure to elements such as UV rays, pollution & stress can weaken the skin barrier.











Replenish Moisture
Keeping skin hydrated is key for healthy looking skin. Ingredients such as Glycerin and water can replenish moisture. La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water has a unique combination of minerals & trace elements to soothe & hydrate skin.











Help Restore the Skin Barrier
Ceramides are a key component of skin. They help to make up the skin barrier and lock in moisture. Ceramides are naturally lost, which can contribute to dry skin. Replenishing these essential lipids is important for maintaining a strong skin barrier.




















NEW Toleriane Daily Moisturizers and Cleansers!

Introducing a new generation of cleansers and moisturizers that work together to help restore healthy looking skin. These gentle formulas replenish moisture and help restore skin’s natural protective barrier.
The new Toleriane products are formulated with La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water, lipid-replenishing Ceramide-3, soothing Niacinamide, and moisturizing Glycerin.
Developed under a stringent formulation charter: oil free, non comedogenic, fragrance free, paraben free, soap and sulfate-free cleansers, allergy tested, dermatologist tested, and suitable for sensitive skin.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
