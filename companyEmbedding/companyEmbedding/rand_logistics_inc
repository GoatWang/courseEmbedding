Net cash flow from operations was $5.2 million for Fiscal Year 2017



Fiscal Year 2017 net loss equaled $19.9 million, or $1.08 per share, after incurring approximately $4.9 million and $4.8 million of pre-tax restructuring related charges and lender fees including non-cash interest, respectively


2017 Sailing Season consistent with expectations thus far

JERSEY CITY, N.J., July  06, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rand Logistics, Inc. (NASDAQ:RLOG) ("Rand"), a leading provider of bulk freight shipping services throughout the Great Lakes Region, today announced its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.
Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 Versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2016 Financial ResultsThe Company's fleet operates on a limited basis in its fiscal fourth quarter due to the normal closing schedule of the locks system and winter weather conditions on the Great Lakes. Vessel repairs and maintenance are completed in the Company's fiscal fourth quarter to prepare the fleet for the upcoming sailing season. As a result, the Company incurs an operating loss in its fiscal fourth quarter. 

Freight and related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels (which excludes fuel and other surcharges) decreased $0.8 million to $4.0 million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to approximately $4.8 million during the same period in 2016.
Total Sailing Days were 166 compared to 113 in the prior year period.
EBITDA equaled a loss of $7.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 versus a loss of $5.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, which included a one-time gain of $1.7 million related to a favorable time charter contract buyout. A reconciliation of operating income to EBITDA is attached to this release.

       Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2017 Versus Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016Financial Results

Net loss was $19.9 million, or $1.08 per share on a fully diluted basis, after incurring approximately $4.9 million of pre-tax restructuring charges and $4.8 million of lender fees. This compares to a loss of $5.6 million, or $0.31 per share, in the year ago period.
Freight and related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels (which excludes fuel and other surcharges) decreased $13.1 million to $110.5 million compared to $123.6 million during the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, freight and related revenue decreased by $12.3 million. A reconciliation of freight and other revenue generated to constant currency is attached to this release.
Total Sailing Days were 3,601 compared to 3,911 in the prior year period (excluding outside charter). 
Delay Days decreased by 16.9% to 285 from 343 Delay Days. Delay Days as a percentage of total Sailing Days was 7.9% compared to 8.8% in Fiscal Year 2016.
Freight and related revenue per Sailing Day decreased $911, or 2.9%, to $30,690 compared to $31,601 during the year ago period.
Vessel operating expenses decreased $16.2 million, or 19.4%, to $67.2 million compared to $83.4 million during the year ago period. Vessel operating expenses per Sailing Day decreased $2,657, or 12.5%, to $18,658 from $21,315. 
Vessel margin per day increased $13, or 0.1%, to $11,756 from $11,743 in the prior year period.  On a constant currency basis, vessel margin per day increased 1.1% or $131.
Adjusted EBITDA after gain on foreign exchange and before refinancing and lender fees decreased $2.8 million, or 8.6%, to $29.7 million from $32.5 million (including a one-time gain of $1.7 million) during the prior year period. A reconciliation of operating income to Adjusted EBITDA is attached to this release.

Management Comments:
"We were generally pleased with our operating performance for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017," commented Ed Levy, President and CEO of Rand. "Vessel margin per day, our key financial metric, equaled $11,756 for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to $11,743 for the prior year and a prior three-year average of $11,643.  On a local currency basis, vessel margin increased by 2.1% or $279 per day. Our goal is to continue to increase vessel margin per day 4 to 6% per year on a local currency basis in line with our historic average. We achieved our $5 million cost savings objective and successfully renewed nine of ten expiring contracts, and in all but one renewal were able to maintain or increase our market share."
"Because of delays in completing certain of our winter maintenance projects, we expect to sail approximately 50 less days, or 3,550 days, in Fiscal Year 2018 versus our previous guidance of 3,600 days and 3,601 in Fiscal Year 2017. For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, we sailed for 1,005 days compared to 969 days in the same period in 2016. Thus far in Fiscal Year 2018, we are on track to reduce general and administrative expenses by approximately $1.5 million versus Fiscal Year 2017. In the current market environment, our goal is to drive efficiencies by managing our capacity and operating expenses and capitalize on the improved demand environment relative to this time last year."
Levy concluded, "Looking ahead, our primary focus remains creating efficient trade patterns to maximize the percentage of time that our vessels are in revenue generating condition and to effectively analyze and react to operating data on a real-time basis to ensure that we are achieving our operational performance objectives. We are currently operating under a series of waivers under our credit facilities, which require us, among other things, to consummate a recapitalization transaction. We are in active discussions with our second lien lender with respect to such recapitalization transaction. While these discussions are ongoing, there is no guaranty that we will be able to reach an agreement with our second lien lender."

   June 24, 2004 – Rand Logistics, Inc. (formerly Rand 
                  Acquisition Corporation) was formed as a blank check company to 
                  effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition or other 
                  similar business combination with an operating business.
   March 3, 2006 – Rand, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, LL 
                Acquisition Corp., acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital 
                stock of Lower Lakes Towing and its affiliates Grand River and 
                Lower Lakes Transportation, whereby each of Lower Lakes, Grand River 
                and Lower Lakes Transportation became indirect, wholly-owned 
                subsidiaries of Rand.  In conjunction with the foregoing 
                transactions, as of March 3, 2006, Rand changed its name to Rand 
                Logistics, Inc. and its fiscal year end to March 31.
   August 1, 2006 – Lower Lakes Transportation entered into a 
                Time Charter Agreement with Wisconsin & Michigan Steamship Company 
                ("WMS"), pursuant to which three United States flag vessels owned by 
                WMS were available for the exclusive use of Lower Lakes 
                Transportation.
   March 23, 2007 – Grand River purchased the M/V MANISTEE, a 
                self-unloading bulk carrier, on an "as-is" basis, for a purchase 
                price of $2,200,000 from Lake Service Shipping Co.  Grand River had 
                previously operated the MANISTEE under a chartering agreement with 
                Lake Service.
   August 27, 2007 – Lower Lakes purchased the VOYAGEUR 
                INDEPENDENT and the VOYAGEUR PIONEER  
                from Voyageur Marine Transport Limited ("Voyageur") and Voyageur Pioneer Marine 
                Inc. for an aggregate purchase price of CDN $25,000,000.
   August 27, 2007 – Lower Lakes entered into a Contract of 
                Affreightment with Voyageur and Voyageur Maritime 
                Trading Inc. under which the MARITIME TRADER was made available 
                exclusively to Lower Lakes for its use in providing transportation 
                and storage services for its customers.
   February 13, 2008 – Grand River Navigation exercised its option to purchase three 
                vessels from WMS, the David Z., the Earl W. and the Wolverine, for 
                an all-in cost of approximately $20 million in cash.  One of the 
                three vessels purchased has subsequently been sold to the Company’s 
                Canadian subsidiary for Canadian registry and deployment.
   February 13, 2008 – Rand Logistics entered into an Amended 
                and Restated Credit Facility Agreement with General Electric Capital 
                Corporation.  The amended credit facility increases Rand’s borrowing 
                capacity to approximately $100 million.
   February 13, 2008 – Rand Logistics announced the planned 
                repowering of one of its Canadian-flagged vessels with a new highly 
                automated emissions compliant power plant. The project, estimated to 
                cost approximately $13 million, is expected to generate an annual 
                mid-teens return and will be completed in April 2008, at which time 
                the vessel will be fully operational. The repowering is expected to 
                improve operating margins due to an increase in speed and a 
                reduction in fuel consumption, labor, maintenance and other 
                operating costs.
   February 13, 2008 – Rand Logistics announced the planned 
                retirement of the Calumet, the oldest and smallest vessel in its 
                fleet.
July 27, 2010 – Rand Logistics announced the planned conversion of its last steam powered vessel, the SS Michipicoten, to diesel power, consistent with the engine replacement completed on the Saginaw in 2008. Based on the actual results from the Saginaw repowering, which was completed in June 2008, the project, which is estimated to cost approximately US $15 million, is expected to generate an annual return on invested funds in the mid teens. The benefits of the conversion include increased revenues from higher speeds and lower costs from reduced fuel consumption, labor, maintenance and other operating expenses. Rand has received a commitment from its lenders to amend its existing credit agreement to provide for an additional CDN $20 million of term debt to complete the engine repowering project and other capital expenditures. Including this project, since the acquisition of Lower Lakes by Rand, the Company has invested more than US $100 million in fleet expansion, life extension and operating improvement projects.
February 14, 2011 – Rand Logistics announced the acquisition of two Jones Act compliant, self-unloading integrated tug/barge units from KK Integrated Shipping (KKIS). The acquisition was structured with $35.5 million cash paid at closing (including $31.0 million financed with third party debt), $5.1 million of attractively priced junior seller paper and 1,305,963 shares of the Company’s common stock.
July 14, 2011 – Rand Logistics announced that it signed a binding asset purchase agreement, whereby its designated subsidiary, Lower Lakes Towing Ltd. ("Lower Lakes") will acquire the Maritime Trader, a Canadian flagged dry bulk carrier, subject only to final approval by the Federal Court of Canada. Concurrent with final court approval, Lower Lakes will enter into a long term contract of affreightment for substantially all of the sailing days related to the acquired vessel. It is anticipated that the closing of the transaction will occur prior to July 31, 2011. The acquisition, which increases the Company’s fleet size to fifteen dry bulk carriers, including twelve self unloading and three bulk carriers, is projected to be accretive to Rand’s free cash flow per share for the year ending March 31, 2012.
September 27, 2011 – Rand Logistics announced that it successfully closed its public underwritten offering of 2,800,000 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share. The Company’s proceeds from the offering, net of underwriter’s commissions, were $16.1 million. Rand expects to use the net proceeds of the offering to partially fund the anticipated acquisition of two dry bulk carriers, one of which is a self-unloader, and for general corporate purposes. With respect to the anticipated acquisitions, Rand also announced today that it has entered into agreements to purchase the two bulk carriers for a total purchase price of $25 million. The acquisition of the self-unloading vessel (which is an integrated tug/barge unit) is subject to Rand obtaining acceptable debt financing for such acquisition. Rand anticipates investing an additional $10 million to modify the two bulk carriers.
October 20, 2011 – Rand Logistics announced that Lower Lakes Towing Ltd., Rand’s Canadian operating subsidiary, completed the previously announced acquisition of a U.S. flagged bulk carrier on October 14, 2011, pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 21, 2011, utilizing proceeds from Rand’s public offering of its common stock in September 2011. Subsequent to closing, the vessel was reflagged Canadian.
December 6, 2011 – Rand Logistics announced that it completed the previously announced acquisition of a Jones Act compliant, self-unloading articulated tug/barge unit. Concurrent with the closing, the Company placed an additional $25 million of long term debt to fund the acquisition and anticipated modifications to the acquired vessel, as well as for general corporate purposes.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.                
                
                NetDania expressly disclaims any liability for any lost principal or profits which without limitation may arise directly or indirectly from the use of or reliance on information on our website or the use of our software with broker integration.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
