Lemons 










































 LimoneiraLemons

With 3,010 acres of lemons throughout California, Limoneira is one of the largest lemon producers in North America. In its 120 years of operation, the Company has introduced a number of innovations that have added significantly to the industry such as improved storage methods and sophisticated harvest practices and equipment. In the 1940’s, Limoneira developed the Limco 8A (bred in Limoneira’s Olivelands 8-A orchard), a new lemon variety that proved more resistant to disease, yielded more fruit, was high in quality and maintained a strong shelf life. This variety remains one of the standard bearers for lemon production throughout the world.
Today, Limoneira maintains a demonstration orchard of over 300 citrus varieties on Limoneira Ranch property in Santa Paula to satisfy consumer tastes and to help keep the Company at the cutting edge of new citrus products. Research continues to be vital. We partner with the University of California’s Agriculture and Natural Resources Program to further agriculture’s forward momentum, and we work with leading partners in our Northern and Southern farming operations to grow, harvest and pack efficiently and sustainability.
Sometimes, the old ways are the best ways. Limoneira’s Mediterranean style packing house built in the 1920’s received recognition for its classic design from the Southern California Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in the early twentieth century. After all these years, it still operates at peak performance.
With our vertical integration from tree to plate, we are able to achieve efficiencies through all parts of the distribution chain, resulting in the highest quality and service possible for our customers. Our global marketing connections and harvesting, packing and quality control capabilities ensure that the customer in Tokyo enjoying our lemons in a delicious fish recipe will be as happy as our North American customer enjoying a refreshing glass of lemonade made with quality Limoneira lemons.

About Us 










































 LimoneiraAbout Us
The Limoneira Company was founded in Ventura County, California in 1893. Its founders were pioneers of spirit and vision that helped lay the foundations of a thriving California citrus industry. Their dedication and innovation in the agricultural industry helped found and develop many institutions that still exist (Sunkist Growers, Fruit Growers Supply and Diamond Walnut). Today, Limoneira has evolved into a global company whose mission is to preserve and promote its tradition, heritage and legacy in agriculture, community development and stewardship to maximize value for its shareholders.
With nearly 11,000 acres of agricultural production, Limoneira is one of the largest providers of lemons and avocados in the United States. In addition to agricultural investments, Limoneira has a long history of community building, and new live-walk-work neighborhoods are close to shovel ready. Commercial and residential income producing and for-sale properties round out our portfolio.
Finally, investments that integrate directly with our agriculture and real estate business relate to stewardship. Sustainability has been woven into the Company’s fabric for over a century. Strategic investments in water, solar, soil, and IPM (integrated Pest Management) enable us to do well by doing good. We also believe that true sustainability means taking care of the communities in which we operate and taking care of our employees. These are investments that we are truly happy to make.

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

Limoneira Company operates as an agribusiness and real estate development company and is one of the largest growers and marketers of lemons in the U.S. and the largest grower of avocados in the U.S. The Company has 10,600 acres of agriculture and real estate property and significant water rights. Operations are in California, Arizona and Chile operates in Agribusiness, Rental Operations, and Real Estate Development.
Agribusiness[edit]
The Agribusiness segment grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and various specialty citrus fruits and other crops, such as Satsuma mandarin oranges, Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios, and olives, as well as pack and sell lemons grown by others. This segment sells and markets lemons directly to food service, wholesale, and retail customers. It has 3,900 acres of lemons; approximately 1,200 acres of avocados; approximately 1,500 acres of oranges; and approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops in Ventura and Tulare counties, California, and Yuma County in Arizona. The Company also has a 35% interest in Rosales S.A., a citrus packing, marketing and sales operation in La Serena Chile. Limoneira owns two packing facilities-one in Santa Paula, California and the other in Yuma, Arizona.
Rental Operations[edit]
The Rental Operations segment rents residential and commercial properties, such as office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. The Company also owns and rents 267 work force housing units and leases approximately 610 acres of land to third party agricultural tenants.
Real Estate Development[edit]
The Company is one of the largest land owners in Ventura County, California. The real estate development segment develops land parcels, multi-family housing, and single-family homes. The Company is developing East Area I and II in Santa Paula, a 550-acre master planned community with 1500 residential units, 500,000sf of commercial space and 150,000sf of light industrial space.Limoneira also owns Windfall Farms in Creston California (San Luis Obispo County), a 720-acre, subdividable (76-10 acre Vineyard estate parcels) which has been planted with 100 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The company also owns three commercial parcels in Santa Maria, California with rights to develop 450 residential units.
Sustainability[edit]
Limoneira employs sustainable practices in virtually each aspect of its day-to-day business and has made strategic investments in solar, water, soil and IPM (Integrated Pest management).
Solar[edit]
In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company headquarters in Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full megawatt of electricity. Representing one-third of the Company’s total use. Solar energy powers Limoneira’s lemon-packing house and storage facility. In the Tulare County town of Ducor, about 150 miles north of Santa Paula, Limoneira installed four smaller solar arrays that together generate another full megawatt of electricity to power 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres. It is estimated that, over their expected 25-year lifespan, Limoneira’s solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an ordinary oil- or coal-firing power plant.[24]
Water Rights[edit]
Through Limoneira’s land position, historic water use, sustainable land use practices and by making investments in infrastructure, The Company has developed long-term, firm and reliable rights to water sufficient to meet any of The Company’s land use objectives.[25]
Organic Recycling[edit]
In 2004, Limoneira Company partnered with Agromin to create an innovative organic recycling program. Agromin is a manufacturer of premium soil products and the green waste recycler for more than 50 communities cities in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Limoneira and Agromin developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) from throughout Ventura County. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.[26]
Integrated Pest Management[edit]
Limoneira was one of the founders of Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative was formed in 1928 and provides pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers. Beneficial insects are bred to control destructive agricultural pests. Limoneira maintains a complete Integrated Pest Management system to bring our sustainably-grown products to market.[27]
Achievements[edit]

Received recognition from The White House.[28]
Received IPM Innovator Award at California Legislature Assembly Resolution.[7]
IPM Innovator award by California Environmental Protection Agency.[29]

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

Limoneira Company operates as an agribusiness and real estate development company and is one of the largest growers and marketers of lemons in the U.S. and the largest grower of avocados in the U.S. The Company has 10,600 acres of agriculture and real estate property and significant water rights. Operations are in California, Arizona and Chile operates in Agribusiness, Rental Operations, and Real Estate Development.
Agribusiness[edit]
The Agribusiness segment grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and various specialty citrus fruits and other crops, such as Satsuma mandarin oranges, Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios, and olives, as well as pack and sell lemons grown by others. This segment sells and markets lemons directly to food service, wholesale, and retail customers. It has 3,900 acres of lemons; approximately 1,200 acres of avocados; approximately 1,500 acres of oranges; and approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops in Ventura and Tulare counties, California, and Yuma County in Arizona. The Company also has a 35% interest in Rosales S.A., a citrus packing, marketing and sales operation in La Serena Chile. Limoneira owns two packing facilities-one in Santa Paula, California and the other in Yuma, Arizona.
Rental Operations[edit]
The Rental Operations segment rents residential and commercial properties, such as office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. The Company also owns and rents 267 work force housing units and leases approximately 610 acres of land to third party agricultural tenants.
Real Estate Development[edit]
The Company is one of the largest land owners in Ventura County, California. The real estate development segment develops land parcels, multi-family housing, and single-family homes. The Company is developing East Area I and II in Santa Paula, a 550-acre master planned community with 1500 residential units, 500,000sf of commercial space and 150,000sf of light industrial space.Limoneira also owns Windfall Farms in Creston California (San Luis Obispo County), a 720-acre, subdividable (76-10 acre Vineyard estate parcels) which has been planted with 100 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The company also owns three commercial parcels in Santa Maria, California with rights to develop 450 residential units.
Sustainability[edit]
Limoneira employs sustainable practices in virtually each aspect of its day-to-day business and has made strategic investments in solar, water, soil and IPM (Integrated Pest management).
Solar[edit]
In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company headquarters in Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full megawatt of electricity. Representing one-third of the Company’s total use. Solar energy powers Limoneira’s lemon-packing house and storage facility. In the Tulare County town of Ducor, about 150 miles north of Santa Paula, Limoneira installed four smaller solar arrays that together generate another full megawatt of electricity to power 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres. It is estimated that, over their expected 25-year lifespan, Limoneira’s solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an ordinary oil- or coal-firing power plant.[24]
Water Rights[edit]
Through Limoneira’s land position, historic water use, sustainable land use practices and by making investments in infrastructure, The Company has developed long-term, firm and reliable rights to water sufficient to meet any of The Company’s land use objectives.[25]
Organic Recycling[edit]
In 2004, Limoneira Company partnered with Agromin to create an innovative organic recycling program. Agromin is a manufacturer of premium soil products and the green waste recycler for more than 50 communities cities in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Limoneira and Agromin developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) from throughout Ventura County. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.[26]
Integrated Pest Management[edit]
Limoneira was one of the founders of Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative was formed in 1928 and provides pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers. Beneficial insects are bred to control destructive agricultural pests. Limoneira maintains a complete Integrated Pest Management system to bring our sustainably-grown products to market.[27]
Achievements[edit]

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

Limoneira Company operates as an agribusiness and real estate development company and is one of the largest growers and marketers of lemons in the U.S. and the largest grower of avocados in the U.S. The Company has 10,600 acres of agriculture and real estate property and significant water rights. Operations are in California, Arizona and Chile operates in Agribusiness, Rental Operations, and Real Estate Development.
Agribusiness[edit]
The Agribusiness segment grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and various specialty citrus fruits and other crops, such as Satsuma mandarin oranges, Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios, and olives, as well as pack and sell lemons grown by others. This segment sells and markets lemons directly to food service, wholesale, and retail customers. It has 3,900 acres of lemons; approximately 1,200 acres of avocados; approximately 1,500 acres of oranges; and approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops in Ventura and Tulare counties, California, and Yuma County in Arizona. The Company also has a 35% interest in Rosales S.A., a citrus packing, marketing and sales operation in La Serena Chile. Limoneira owns two packing facilities-one in Santa Paula, California and the other in Yuma, Arizona.
Rental Operations[edit]
The Rental Operations segment rents residential and commercial properties, such as office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. The Company also owns and rents 267 work force housing units and leases approximately 610 acres of land to third party agricultural tenants.
Real Estate Development[edit]
The Company is one of the largest land owners in Ventura County, California. The real estate development segment develops land parcels, multi-family housing, and single-family homes. The Company is developing East Area I and II in Santa Paula, a 550-acre master planned community with 1500 residential units, 500,000sf of commercial space and 150,000sf of light industrial space.Limoneira also owns Windfall Farms in Creston California (San Luis Obispo County), a 720-acre, subdividable (76-10 acre Vineyard estate parcels) which has been planted with 100 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The company also owns three commercial parcels in Santa Maria, California with rights to develop 450 residential units.
Sustainability[edit]
Limoneira employs sustainable practices in virtually each aspect of its day-to-day business and has made strategic investments in solar, water, soil and IPM (Integrated Pest management).
Solar[edit]
In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company headquarters in Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full megawatt of electricity. Representing one-third of the Company’s total use. Solar energy powers Limoneira’s lemon-packing house and storage facility. In the Tulare County town of Ducor, about 150 miles north of Santa Paula, Limoneira installed four smaller solar arrays that together generate another full megawatt of electricity to power 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres. It is estimated that, over their expected 25-year lifespan, Limoneira’s solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an ordinary oil- or coal-firing power plant.[24]
Water Rights[edit]
Through Limoneira’s land position, historic water use, sustainable land use practices and by making investments in infrastructure, The Company has developed long-term, firm and reliable rights to water sufficient to meet any of The Company’s land use objectives.[25]
Organic Recycling[edit]
In 2004, Limoneira Company partnered with Agromin to create an innovative organic recycling program. Agromin is a manufacturer of premium soil products and the green waste recycler for more than 50 communities cities in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Limoneira and Agromin developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) from throughout Ventura County. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.[26]
Integrated Pest Management[edit]
Limoneira was one of the founders of Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative was formed in 1928 and provides pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers. Beneficial insects are bred to control destructive agricultural pests. Limoneira maintains a complete Integrated Pest Management system to bring our sustainably-grown products to market.[27]
Achievements[edit]

Received recognition from The White House.[28]
Received IPM Innovator Award at California Legislature Assembly Resolution.[7]
IPM Innovator award by California Environmental Protection Agency.[29]

There are plenty of ways Limoneira Co. differentiates itself from other agribusinesses in the United States. The company stands alone through its sustainable business operations, its quality control methods and the rigorous traceability processes in place for its citrus produce.
However, the ability to understand what it takes to stand out from the rest in the crowded citrus-growing industry comes over time, and there aren’t many producers that can boast continuous operations for more than a century like Limoneira can.
“We have a little bit of a leg up because we’ve been around since 1893, so we’ve been doing this for 120 years,” President and CEO Harold S. Edwards says. “We’ve been pretty successful at being a sustainable business, and our business practice is to have good, sustainable suppliers.”
The company traces its origins to 1893 when Union Oil founder Wallace L. Hardison partnered with Nathan W. Blanchard to purchase 413 acres of land from J.K. Gries in Santa Paula, Calif., about one hour north of Los Angeles. The partners envisioned becoming the first large-scale citrus supplier for U.S. markets, so Limoneira – which means “lemon lands” in Portuguese – developed a more reliable supply chain for citrus to ship to the East Coast. In its early days, the company also supplied Valencia oranges and walnuts.
Today, Limoneira is the largest vertically integrated lemon supplier in the United States, all of which are marketed under the Limoneira brand. The company also stands as the largest avocado grower in the United States, and Limoneira boasts large orange and specialty citrus orchards in its portfolio.
Edwards says the company supplies product all over the world, with 21 percent of its distribution heading to foreign markets, especially Southeast Asia. Limoneira owns and operates 8,200 acres throughout California and has added pistachios, and cherries to its offerings. About 70 percent of the company’s lemon business comes from foodservices clients, with retail accounting for the rest of the sales.
Here Comes the Sun
Limoneira takes pride in its status as a sustainably operated agribusiness, and Edwards says it strives to reduce its carbon footprint by making strategic investments in solar, water, soil and integrated pest management (IPM). “The company has had a commitment to good stewardship to resources since its inception,” Edwards says. “What we’ve found over time is our approach to production and the way we market and sell and work with employees have all been neatly captured under the popular trend called sustainability. We’re finding more and more of our customer base putting more importance on how their suppliers and vendors view sustainability, and we rank highly on their indexes.”
For instance, Limoneira relies heavily on solar power for the energy it needs to run its business. In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. At its headquarters in Santa Paula, the company installed a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates 1 megawatt of electricity. Limoneira states that and this represents 60 percent of the company’s packing operations.
In Ducor, Calif. – about 150 miles north of headquarters – Limoneira installed four smaller solar installations that combine to generate another full megawatt of electricity. This powers 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres.
Through these solar energy projects, Limoneira estimates that the solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an oil- or coal-firing power plant over 25 years. Edwards states that 60 percent of all electricity Limoneira uses is generated through its investments in solar power.
As for its organic waste, Limoneira partnered with Agromin – a manufacturer of premium soil products and a green waste recycler in Southern California – for a comprehensive organic recycling program. The companies developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials such as lawn clippings, leaves and bark from Ventura County, Calif. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira’s orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures. This partnership recycles 90 percent of western Ventura County’s green waste to create mulch and compost for its use.
To avoid putting more pesticides into the environment, Limoneira long ago launched Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative formed in 1928 provides complete pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers by breeding beneficial insects to control destructive agricultural pests.
Also, for the water it needs to support its business, Limoneira maintains water quality and supply through rigorous lab testing, filtration systems and a network of micro sprinklers.
“All of this is being done with the highest level of detail and attention paid to food safety and traceability for the food products we supply,” Edwards says. “We’re the largest and only global GAP [good agricultural practices] tree-to-dock lemon supplier in the U.S., and that allows us to optimize procedures and provide instant traceability and of all the way to the blocks or trees where our produce comes from. This assures the highest level of quality in our food safety practices.”
Traceable & Accountable
Aside from the sustainable aspects of their operations, Limoneira and similar growers must adhere to the strictest traceability standards as set by foodservice and retail buyers throughout the United States and around the world.
“Consumers and as a result the trade – foodservice and retail buyers, specifically – have become increasingly more focused on traceability and food safety initiatives and concerns, so we have a desire to create traceability to the production sources,” Edwards says. “A lot of it is just record-keeping and allowing records to be complete.”
Because Limoneira is a vertically integrated lemon business – meaning its products are plucked from the trees, sent to a warehouse and delivered to customers under the company’s watch – it boasts full traceability of its products.
“That gives our customer base a much greater degree of confidence that our highest quality and safety is an instantly traceable product to them,” Edwards says. “In combination with that and being considered one of the leaders among sustainable producers, it puts us at the top of the list of suppliers for the customers we work with. Some of this country’s largest customers choose us over larger suppliers for the things we do in that regard.”
The Growing Middle Class
As Limoneira expands further into Asia, its ability to cater to the tastes of the ever-expanding middle class in this part of the world will help it grow. Edwards says the company has witnessed growing global consumption of lemons, especially in China and India where burgeoning economies are getting stronger every year.
Edwards says the company has seen its lemon business double in size, and Limoneira is expected to ship between 3 million and 3.2 million cartons of lemons worldwide in 2013 compared to just 1.4 million in 2010. He attributes this rapid growth to a nationwide advertising and promotional campaign called “Unleash the Natural Power of Lemons,” which introduces consumers to alternative uses for the versatile lemon.
“As we’ve begun to launch initiatives in cities in the United States, we begin to move up in the overall category of lemon consumption,” Edwards says.

			Limoneira Co. Inc. working within lemon niche internationally 		








by Tad Thompson | July 12, 2011

Limoneira Co. Inc. in Santa Paula, CA, is formalizing 20-year-old relationships with lemon export allies in both Argentina and Chile.
On June 17, Alex Teague, senior vice president of the firm, which is a division of Calavo, told The Produce News, “We have had, over the last 20 years, an informal association with the two groups.” Limoneira is “beginning a formalization” with FGF Trapani, headquartered in Tucuman, Argentina, and Rosales Packing in La Serena, Chile.
The new arrangement means Limoneira’s product will now be shipped from Chile and Argentina.
Mr. Teague also noted that Limoneira is a selling agent for lemons grown in Mexico for the first time, handling fruit from the Monterey area. That product will be available from July until December.
According to the Limoneira web site, the company was created in 1893 and produces lemons from 1,839 acres throughout California. Mr. Teague said that the California growing operations supply Limoneira lemons year round, but the volume is unable to satisfy demand at certain times of the year. Thus, he said, the three additional countries complement Limoneira’s domestic and export sales.
The process of finding international alliances has involved taking the time to pick firms with similar interests in handling high-quality product, sustainable practices and producing food-safe lemons, he noted.
Lemons “from Argentina, Chile and Mexico are high quality for that time of year. They fit our marketing window for the quality niche we have. They are a strong piece of the puzzle.”
Limoneira enjoys “heavy exports to the Pacific Rim, and during the summertime, Chilean fruit takes a quality position in the marketplace in Japan.” Limoneira will be servicing Japanese customers throughout the year “with traditional California labels with fruit from both California and Chile.” Chile will supply “a fresher crop and has a strong summer position in Japan.”
The Chilean lemons are generally shipped by sea containers to Panama and then transshipped to Japan.
“This is part of being a market-driven lemon supplier — to have the best fruit of the best quality with the best price that week.”
Mr. Teague said that Chilean lemons have been exported to Japan for “quite a while,” and he added that Limoneira might be the first California shipper associated with the deal.
Argentine lemons have not been allowed into the United States since a phytosanitary dispute created a ban in 1999-2000. Thus, Limoneira is involved in shipping Argentine lemons directly to eastern Canada from Buenos Aires. “We have been doing this quite a while. We are not reinventing the wheel, although we do work to improve it. In essence, this is a market-driven service. Our customers rely on us to be their lemon supplier.”

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

Limoneira Company operates as an agribusiness and real estate development company and is one of the largest growers and marketers of lemons in the U.S. and the largest grower of avocados in the U.S. The Company has 10,600 acres of agriculture and real estate property and significant water rights. Operations are in California, Arizona and Chile operates in Agribusiness, Rental Operations, and Real Estate Development.
Agribusiness[edit]
The Agribusiness segment grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and various specialty citrus fruits and other crops, such as Satsuma mandarin oranges, Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios, and olives, as well as pack and sell lemons grown by others. This segment sells and markets lemons directly to food service, wholesale, and retail customers. It has 3,900 acres of lemons; approximately 1,200 acres of avocados; approximately 1,500 acres of oranges; and approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops in Ventura and Tulare counties, California, and Yuma County in Arizona. The Company also has a 35% interest in Rosales S.A., a citrus packing, marketing and sales operation in La Serena Chile. Limoneira owns two packing facilities-one in Santa Paula, California and the other in Yuma, Arizona.
Rental Operations[edit]
The Rental Operations segment rents residential and commercial properties, such as office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. The Company also owns and rents 267 work force housing units and leases approximately 610 acres of land to third party agricultural tenants.
Real Estate Development[edit]
The Company is one of the largest land owners in Ventura County, California. The real estate development segment develops land parcels, multi-family housing, and single-family homes. The Company is developing East Area I and II in Santa Paula, a 550-acre master planned community with 1500 residential units, 500,000sf of commercial space and 150,000sf of light industrial space.Limoneira also owns Windfall Farms in Creston California (San Luis Obispo County), a 720-acre, subdividable (76-10 acre Vineyard estate parcels) which has been planted with 100 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The company also owns three commercial parcels in Santa Maria, California with rights to develop 450 residential units.
Sustainability[edit]
Limoneira employs sustainable practices in virtually each aspect of its day-to-day business and has made strategic investments in solar, water, soil and IPM (Integrated Pest management).
Solar[edit]
In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company headquarters in Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full megawatt of electricity. Representing one-third of the Company’s total use. Solar energy powers Limoneira’s lemon-packing house and storage facility. In the Tulare County town of Ducor, about 150 miles north of Santa Paula, Limoneira installed four smaller solar arrays that together generate another full megawatt of electricity to power 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres. It is estimated that, over their expected 25-year lifespan, Limoneira’s solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an ordinary oil- or coal-firing power plant.[24]
Water Rights[edit]
Through Limoneira’s land position, historic water use, sustainable land use practices and by making investments in infrastructure, The Company has developed long-term, firm and reliable rights to water sufficient to meet any of The Company’s land use objectives.[25]
Organic Recycling[edit]
In 2004, Limoneira Company partnered with Agromin to create an innovative organic recycling program. Agromin is a manufacturer of premium soil products and the green waste recycler for more than 50 communities cities in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Limoneira and Agromin developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) from throughout Ventura County. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.[26]
Integrated Pest Management[edit]
Limoneira was one of the founders of Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative was formed in 1928 and provides pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers. Beneficial insects are bred to control destructive agricultural pests. Limoneira maintains a complete Integrated Pest Management system to bring our sustainably-grown products to market.[27]
Achievements[edit]

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

Limoneira Company operates as an agribusiness and real estate development company and is one of the largest growers and marketers of lemons in the U.S. and the largest grower of avocados in the U.S. The Company has 10,600 acres of agriculture and real estate property and significant water rights. Operations are in California, Arizona and Chile operates in Agribusiness, Rental Operations, and Real Estate Development.
Agribusiness[edit]
The Agribusiness segment grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and various specialty citrus fruits and other crops, such as Satsuma mandarin oranges, Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios, and olives, as well as pack and sell lemons grown by others. This segment sells and markets lemons directly to food service, wholesale, and retail customers. It has 3,900 acres of lemons; approximately 1,200 acres of avocados; approximately 1,500 acres of oranges; and approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops in Ventura and Tulare counties, California, and Yuma County in Arizona. The Company also has a 35% interest in Rosales S.A., a citrus packing, marketing and sales operation in La Serena Chile. Limoneira owns two packing facilities-one in Santa Paula, California and the other in Yuma, Arizona.
Rental Operations[edit]
The Rental Operations segment rents residential and commercial properties, such as office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. The Company also owns and rents 267 work force housing units and leases approximately 610 acres of land to third party agricultural tenants.
Real Estate Development[edit]
The Company is one of the largest land owners in Ventura County, California. The real estate development segment develops land parcels, multi-family housing, and single-family homes. The Company is developing East Area I and II in Santa Paula, a 550-acre master planned community with 1500 residential units, 500,000sf of commercial space and 150,000sf of light industrial space.Limoneira also owns Windfall Farms in Creston California (San Luis Obispo County), a 720-acre, subdividable (76-10 acre Vineyard estate parcels) which has been planted with 100 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The company also owns three commercial parcels in Santa Maria, California with rights to develop 450 residential units.
Sustainability[edit]
Limoneira employs sustainable practices in virtually each aspect of its day-to-day business and has made strategic investments in solar, water, soil and IPM (Integrated Pest management).
Solar[edit]
In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company headquarters in Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full megawatt of electricity. Representing one-third of the Company’s total use. Solar energy powers Limoneira’s lemon-packing house and storage facility. In the Tulare County town of Ducor, about 150 miles north of Santa Paula, Limoneira installed four smaller solar arrays that together generate another full megawatt of electricity to power 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres. It is estimated that, over their expected 25-year lifespan, Limoneira’s solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an ordinary oil- or coal-firing power plant.[24]
Water Rights[edit]
Through Limoneira’s land position, historic water use, sustainable land use practices and by making investments in infrastructure, The Company has developed long-term, firm and reliable rights to water sufficient to meet any of The Company’s land use objectives.[25]
Organic Recycling[edit]
In 2004, Limoneira Company partnered with Agromin to create an innovative organic recycling program. Agromin is a manufacturer of premium soil products and the green waste recycler for more than 50 communities cities in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Limoneira and Agromin developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) from throughout Ventura County. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.[26]
Integrated Pest Management[edit]
Limoneira was one of the founders of Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative was formed in 1928 and provides pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers. Beneficial insects are bred to control destructive agricultural pests. Limoneira maintains a complete Integrated Pest Management system to bring our sustainably-grown products to market.[27]
Achievements[edit]

Received recognition from The White House.[28]
Received IPM Innovator Award at California Legislature Assembly Resolution.[7]
IPM Innovator award by California Environmental Protection Agency.[29]

History[edit]




Limoneira's lemon exhibit (right) was featured at the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1909


Limoneira was founded in 1893 at Union Oil Company Building in Santa Paula, California by Nathan Blanchard, Sr., one of the founders of Santa Paula, and Wallace Hardison and started with 412.96 acres of land which over time would increase as the company grew. There are several stories behind the name "Limoneira" with some saying it came from Spanish and others said it was Portuguese. At the time, they were growing both lemons and oranges and 1895 was a milestone for the company, when it planted 690 orange trees, its first non-lemon product. By 1898, the company had nearly 50,000 trees, consisting of: 32,000 lemon trees, 3,000 grapefruit trees and 12,000 orange trees.[11] This year, Blanchard also retired and appointed Charles M. Teague as his successor.[12]
The Limoneira plantation also had its own fire department, which still exists today and is one of the oldest continuously operating fire departments in Ventura County. In 1901, Limoneira achieved its first net profit and paid its first dividend to stockholders the following year. In 1907, Limoneira purchased the 2,300 acre Olivelands Tract, acquiring 1,000 of agriculture for walnuts, olives, beans, corn and hay and, because it converted 1,300 to livestock grazing, the company also purchased the Santa Paula and Horse and Feed Company the next year. In January 1908, the newspaper Ventura Free Press ran a story for Limoneira called "Greatest Lemon Ranch in the World", saying ""A further increase in the size of the largest lemon plantation in the world...will be the result of planting this season at the Limoneira Ranch. There are now...27,000 bearing lemon trees on the property, and this year trees will be on 300 acres more. The crop last year was the largest since the planting has begun..Bigness is not the chief end kept in view the management of the ranch. The growth of the enterprise, in fact, has come from never flagging efforts to maintain and improve the quality of the product. In addition to lemons, the ranch has 500 acres of walnuts".[11]
By 1913, the company's growth was evident and the Santa Paula Chronicle said ""The Lemoneira (sic) Company has demonstrated the wisdom of ample frost protection. The company will ship more than 450 cars of lemons this year, approximately one-third of the entire amount to the be shipped from this State". By 1916, the company was battling Sunkist as both of them had nationally recognized products and Limoneira refused to exclusively brand their oranges as "Sunkist" but later reluctantly agreed.
By the 1920s, the company’s acreage under cultivation had quadrupled in less than 30 years and numerous building and expansion projects were underway. It was the solid base created in the previous 30 years that pulled the company through the Depression and the challenges of the 1940s.[13][14] In 1900, with Teague as the manager, he built the company into the state's largest citrus holding and the world's largest acreage. The company also joined the Southern California Fruit Exchange before pulling out a few years later and joining again in 1911.[15][16]
The company also once set the record for deepest oil well in Ventura County before abandoning the well in 1949. The well like many others were in search of oil but oil was never found on Limoneira properties despite several companies participating in drilling, including Superior Oil Company, Richfield Oil Corporation, Humble Oil, Unocal Corporation and Standard Oil. Throughout its history, it has employed foreign labor includind Japanese[17] and Mexicans. In 1924, after the Immigration Act of 1924 which barred Japanese immigration, it particularly focused on Mexican labor.[18][19] Since the 1970s, Limoneira has also been a leading lemon supplier to Japan and also distributes to Korea, China, Philippines and Thailand.[20] In 1985, Limoneira partnered with Samuel Edwards Associates to become Limoneira Associates until Limoneira become one company again in 1990.
In 2005, Limoneira made a cross-equity agreement with Calavo Growers where Limoneira got a 6.9 stake of Calavo while Calavo got a 15.1 stake in Limoneira.[21] In 2013, Limoneira acquired Associated Citrus Packers, Inc. of Yuma, Arizona for $18.6 million.[22] In 2014, it acquired Martin Ranching Company for $1.4 million.[23]

Limoneira Company operates as an agribusiness and real estate development company and is one of the largest growers and marketers of lemons in the U.S. and the largest grower of avocados in the U.S. The Company has 10,600 acres of agriculture and real estate property and significant water rights. Operations are in California, Arizona and Chile operates in Agribusiness, Rental Operations, and Real Estate Development.
Agribusiness[edit]
The Agribusiness segment grows lemons, avocados, oranges, and various specialty citrus fruits and other crops, such as Satsuma mandarin oranges, Moro blood oranges, Cara Cara oranges, Minneola tangelos, Star Ruby grapefruit, pummelos, pistachios, and olives, as well as pack and sell lemons grown by others. This segment sells and markets lemons directly to food service, wholesale, and retail customers. It has 3,900 acres of lemons; approximately 1,200 acres of avocados; approximately 1,500 acres of oranges; and approximately 800 acres of specialty citrus and other crops in Ventura and Tulare counties, California, and Yuma County in Arizona. The Company also has a 35% interest in Rosales S.A., a citrus packing, marketing and sales operation in La Serena Chile. Limoneira owns two packing facilities-one in Santa Paula, California and the other in Yuma, Arizona.
Rental Operations[edit]
The Rental Operations segment rents residential and commercial properties, such as office buildings and a multi-use facility consisting of a retail convenience store, gas station, car wash, and quick-serve restaurant. The Company also owns and rents 267 work force housing units and leases approximately 610 acres of land to third party agricultural tenants.
Real Estate Development[edit]
The Company is one of the largest land owners in Ventura County, California. The real estate development segment develops land parcels, multi-family housing, and single-family homes. The Company is developing East Area I and II in Santa Paula, a 550-acre master planned community with 1500 residential units, 500,000sf of commercial space and 150,000sf of light industrial space.Limoneira also owns Windfall Farms in Creston California (San Luis Obispo County), a 720-acre, subdividable (76-10 acre Vineyard estate parcels) which has been planted with 100 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon wine grapes. The company also owns three commercial parcels in Santa Maria, California with rights to develop 450 residential units.
Sustainability[edit]
Limoneira employs sustainable practices in virtually each aspect of its day-to-day business and has made strategic investments in solar, water, soil and IPM (Integrated Pest management).
Solar[edit]
In 2008, Limoneira completed two state-of-the-art solar projects. The first, at company headquarters in Santa Paula, CA., is a 5.5-acre photovoltaic orchard that generates a full megawatt of electricity. Representing one-third of the Company’s total use. Solar energy powers Limoneira’s lemon-packing house and storage facility. In the Tulare County town of Ducor, about 150 miles north of Santa Paula, Limoneira installed four smaller solar arrays that together generate another full megawatt of electricity to power 250-horsepower motors that pump deep well water into reservoirs for the irrigation of 1,000 agricultural acres. It is estimated that, over their expected 25-year lifespan, Limoneira’s solar generation of 84 million kilowatt hours will save at least 64,000 tons of greenhouse gases that would have otherwise been emitted by an ordinary oil- or coal-firing power plant.[24]
Water Rights[edit]
Through Limoneira’s land position, historic water use, sustainable land use practices and by making investments in infrastructure, The Company has developed long-term, firm and reliable rights to water sufficient to meet any of The Company’s land use objectives.[25]
Organic Recycling[edit]
In 2004, Limoneira Company partnered with Agromin to create an innovative organic recycling program. Agromin is a manufacturer of premium soil products and the green waste recycler for more than 50 communities cities in Los Angeles, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties. Limoneira and Agromin developed a 10-acre facility on Limoneira land to receive green materials (lawn clipping, leaves, bark, plant materials) from throughout Ventura County. The material is converted into mulch that is spread in Limoneira orchards to curb erosion, improve water efficiency, reduce weeds and moderate soil temperatures.[26]
Integrated Pest Management[edit]
Limoneira was one of the founders of Associates Insectary. This grower-owned cooperative was formed in 1928 and provides pest control services to commercial citrus and avocado farmers. Beneficial insects are bred to control destructive agricultural pests. Limoneira maintains a complete Integrated Pest Management system to bring our sustainably-grown products to market.[27]
Achievements[edit]

Received recognition from The White House.[28]
Received IPM Innovator Award at California Legislature Assembly Resolution.[7]
IPM Innovator award by California Environmental Protection Agency.[29]
