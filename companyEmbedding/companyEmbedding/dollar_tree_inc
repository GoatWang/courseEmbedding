History[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1954, K. R. Perry[2] opened a Ben Franklin variety store in Norfolk, Virginia, which later became known as K&K 5&10. In 1970, K.R. Perry, Doug Perry, and Macon Brock started K&K Toys in Norfolk, Virginia. This mall concept grew to over 130 stores on the East Coast. In 1986, Doug Perry, Macon Brock, and Ray Compton started another chain store called Only $1.00 with five stores, one in Georgia, one in Tennessee, and three in Virginia. The expansion of Dollar Stores was continued alongside K&K Toys stores, mostly in enclosed malls. In 1991, the corporation made a decision to focus exclusively on the expansion of dollar stores after selling K&K stores to KB Toys, a Melville Corporation.
1990s[edit]
In 1993, the name Only $1.00 was changed to Dollar Tree Stores to address what could be a multi-price-point strategy in the future, and part equity interest was sold to SKM partners, a private equity firm.
On March 6, 1995, Dollar Tree, Inc. went public on the NASDAQ exchange at $15 a share, with a market cap then calculated at $225 million.
In 1996, Dollar Tree acquired Dollar Bill$, Inc., a Chicago-based chain of 136 stores.
In 1997, the company opened its first distribution center and its new store support center, both located in Chesapeake, Virginia.
In 1998, Dollar Tree acquired 98-Cent Clearance Centers in California.
In 1999, Dollar Tree acquired Only $One stores based in New York state. This same year, the company opened its second Distribution Center in Olive Branch, Mississippi.
2000s[edit]
In 2000, Dollar Tree acquired Dollar Express, a Philadelphia-based company, and also built a new distribution center in Stockton, California. In 2001, the company opened two additional distribution centers, in Savannah, Georgia, and Briar Creek, Pennsylvania. In 2003, Dollar Tree acquired Salt Lake City, Utah-based Greenbacks, Inc., and opened a new distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma.




This Dollar Tree store in Northwood, Ohio, is the only store that continues to use the defunct Super Dollar Tree banner.


In 2004, Dollar Tree opened its first store in North Dakota which marked its operation of stores in all 48 contiguous states. The company also opened new distribution centers in Joliet, Illinois, and Ridgefield, Washington.
In 2006, Dollar Tree celebrated its 20th year of retailing at a $1.00 price point, opened its 3,000th store, and acquired 138 DEAL$ stores, previously owned by SUPERVALU INC.
In 2007, Dollar Tree expanded its Briar Creek Distribution Center, crossed the $4 billion sales threshold, and had a market capitalization of $3.29 billion. In 2008, Dollar Tree earned a place in the Fortune 500. By the close of 2009, the company opened a store in Washington, D.C., and purchased a new distribution center in San Bernardino, California.
In 2009, Dollar Tree redesigned its website with a new e-commerce platform. DollarTree.com sells Dollar Tree merchandise in larger quantities to individuals, small businesses, and organizations. The company also advertises in-store events, specials, seasonal promotions, and featured products through the site and users can locate a retail store, research information about Dollar Tree, and view product recalls. Dollar Tree also recently added customer ratings and reviews and customer stories to the site.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, the corporation opened its 4,000th chain store and acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant stores which are based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.
In 2011, Dollar Tree achieved total sales of $6.63 billion, opened 278 new stores, and completed a 400,000 square-foot expansion of its distribution center in Savannah, Georgia.
In 2012, Dollar Tree opened another 345 new stores and exceeded $7 billion in sales, with an end-of-the-year market cap at $9.13 billion.
On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced it was offering $9.2 billion for the purchase of competitor chain store Family Dollar. On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion for Family Dollar.[3] The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[4]
In January 2015, Dollar Tree announced plans to divest 300 stores in order to appease US regulators scrutinizing its proposed takeover of Family Dollar stores.[5]
In June 2015, the firm agreed to sell 330 stores to private equity company Sycamore Partners as part of the approval process for its $8.5 billion takeover of Family Dollar.[6]
Business strategy[edit]
Dollar Tree is classified as an extreme discount store.[7] It claims to be able to achieve this because their buyers "work extremely hard to find the best bargains out there", and it has "great control over the tremendous buying power at the dollar price-point".[8] Its prices are primarily designed to attract those with financial difficulties, but it has also become popular with more affluent customers.[9]
Family Dollar bidding[edit]




Exterior of a store in Hillsboro, Oregon


On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that a deal had been reached and approved by both parties to purchase Family Dollar for $8.5 billion plus acquisition of the $1 billion in debt currently held by Family Dollar.[10][11][12] The deal came in the month following activist investor and major shareholder[13] Carl Icahn's demand that Family Dollar be promptly put up for sale.[14] After their reported deal had been struck, Dollar General entered the bidding, surpassing Dollar Tree's offer, with a $9.7 billion bid on August 18, 2014.[15] On August 20, 2014 Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. The Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General, since the start of the year a statement from CEO Howard Levine outlined.[4]
Canada[edit]
Main article: Dollar Tree Canada
In November 2010, Dollar Tree announced that it had acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant Stores based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.[16]
Recalls[edit]
The Consumer Product Safety Commission lists several recalls for products sold at Dollar Tree stores. The recalled products include salsa jars with broken glass inside them, hot-melt mini glue guns (recalled in January 2008) which could short circuit and cause burns[17] and candle sets (recalled in February 2004) which could produce excessive flame.[18]

Dollar Tree is classified as an extreme discount store.[7] It claims to be able to achieve this because their buyers "work extremely hard to find the best bargains out there", and it has "great control over the tremendous buying power at the dollar price-point".[8] Its prices are primarily designed to attract those with financial difficulties, but it has also become popular with more affluent customers.[9]
Family Dollar bidding[edit]




Exterior of a store in Hillsboro, Oregon


On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that a deal had been reached and approved by both parties to purchase Family Dollar for $8.5 billion plus acquisition of the $1 billion in debt currently held by Family Dollar.[10][11][12] The deal came in the month following activist investor and major shareholder[13] Carl Icahn's demand that Family Dollar be promptly put up for sale.[14] After their reported deal had been struck, Dollar General entered the bidding, surpassing Dollar Tree's offer, with a $9.7 billion bid on August 18, 2014.[15] On August 20, 2014 Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. The Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General, since the start of the year a statement from CEO Howard Levine outlined.[4]
Canada[edit]
Main article: Dollar Tree Canada
In November 2010, Dollar Tree announced that it had acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant Stores based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.[16]
Recalls[edit]
The Consumer Product Safety Commission lists several recalls for products sold at Dollar Tree stores. The recalled products include salsa jars with broken glass inside them, hot-melt mini glue guns (recalled in January 2008) which could short circuit and cause burns[17] and candle sets (recalled in February 2004) which could produce excessive flame.[18]

										I know for only a dollar, the products provided by the Dollar Tree aren't gonna be of very high quality. But wow, I never expected it to damage my home!. I purchased a 4-pack of self-sticking picture hooks. I brought them home, read the back of the pack (which by the way says exactly: 'Use to hang small pictures, plaques, gadgets, utensils, etc. No tools or messy glue are needed to apply these easy to use hooks.      Be sure mounting surface is free of grease, dust & wax.   Avoid hanging objects over TV sets, stereos, beds, sofas, or any expensive furniture.') So, indirectly, they warn you that items can fall off and harm someone or something, but they NEVER gave any kind of warning that the product could mess up surfaces. I placed 2 of them on my wall to hang 2 pictures for my daughter (which is what they are for!!!). I realized they were crooked so i tried to remove them to straighten them out. I peeled slowly and carefully, but they still took off layers of paint and wall.  I put a little bit of oil on the second one to help get it off without ruining yet another piece of wall. Unfortunately, the this time was worse than the first piece.  I have always been careful not to put holes in my walls or anything like that, and now I have 2 holes (both 2" x 2") in one of my walls.  On top of that, it is IMPOSSIBLE to reach anyone in the company. you can call the 757 number listed above and get peoples voicemails who never call back, or they give you a scond number to call which tells you you can't leave a voicemail, says 'Thank You' and hangs up on you.  On the website, if you click the 'Contact Us' link, it gives you the option to leave your name and a question or comment, but no one responds, no matter how many you leave...  Trust me though, I will not give up!  Someone with authority in that company will hear about this!

														Rip-off reports can be quite damaging to the business that the report is about. This was a mistake on the consumers part by not applying the product in its intended place and having to re-position them. The product worked so well that it adhesed itself to where removing it was difficult. You can't ask for more than that in a hanger unless you make sure to specifically look for removeable hangers. For a dollar, sir, you got very high quality. One thing I can say negative about Dollar tree is that their jarred "Island Choice" peaches require a vice to open.

														I have to agree with the contractor on this matter. The point that he made about leaving nail holes was classic. I have myself purchased this specific hook from the Dollar Tree and found that it has done exactly what it is supposed to do. The fact the it did not fall off actually suprised me because it was only a dollar! It worked BETTER than I expected! If your wall was damaged that would be due to things that you did not Greenbrier Int. or the Dollar Tree.													   Respond to this report!  What's this?

AUTHOR: James -  (United States of America) SUBMITTED: Tuesday, November 24, 2009 POSTED: Tuesday, November 24, 2009  
														As a paint contractor, I have to add my two cents worth, on this one.  I've used these stick-on picture hang ups many times.  The product works fine.  They are not made to be moved around. They are made to STICK, and hang pictures.  If you wanted the removable kind you should have gone to Wal Mart and bought the rubberized gummy removable ones for $5.00. If the package doesn't say "easily moved with no damage to surfaces" then don't expect it. If you'd nailed them in the wrong place, would you blame them for YOUR nail holes??? You can't blame the product because you can't read.  By the way is this your first time at gluing pictures to a wall?  Expect paint damage (at least) and wall paper damage (possibly) and maybe even some drywall surface damage, in the event that you didn't take the time to measure and attach your hangers where you wanted them in the first place.  And contacting the company because you yanked them down and got some wall damage, is ridiculous!  Do you expect them to send a crew to your house to patch and repaint your walls, that YOU damaged? Jeeeezz lady, calm down, smear a little spackling paste over the damage (or tooth paste works even) and let it dry overnight, sandpaper lightly, then use a sponge to apply a couple dabs of paint, and get over it. Your going to give yourself a heart attack over NOTHING.  Life is too short, to go ballastic over your own little mistakes.  James, Columbus, GA. USA    Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?       #5 Consumer Comment  YOU HAD THE CHOICE TO USE THOSE STICK UPS OR NOT TO HANG THEM UP... AUTHOR: Joe -  (U.S.A.) SUBMITTED: Monday, February 23, 2009 POSTED: Monday, February 23, 2009  
														I SHOP AT THE DOLLAR GENERAL STORE ALL THE TIME. 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULD NOT USE. 
WHAT SORT OF WALLS WERE YOU TRYING TO HANG THESE ON? 
YOU CAN USE OLD ENGLISH FURNITURE POLISH TO CLEAN UP PROBLEMS WITH THE WOOD PANELING. 
AND SOME PAINT WITH A SMALL ROLLER TO COVER UP MINOR PROBLEMS IN THE WALL. 
ME, I JUST PUT MY PHOTOS --WHAT FEW I HAVE -- ON THE BOOKCASES AND LEAVE THE WALLS BLANK... 
BUT AFTER THE BAD EXPERIENCE I HAD WITH THE FIRST ONE, I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE USED THE SECOND ONE... 
THERE IS A "BUYER BEWARE" WARNING IMPLICIT IN EVERYTHING YOU BUY WHETHER OR NOT IT COMES FROM NEIMAN-MARCUS OR DOLLAR TREE OR HOME DEPOT. 
ONCE YOU PUT THIS STUFF ON THE WALL, IT IS THERE, AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND CAUSE BAD THINGS HAPPEN. 
GOOD LUCK IN REPAIRING YOUR WALL.													   Respond to this report!  What's this?  Are you an owner, employee or ex-employee with either negative or positive information about the company or individual, or can you provide "insider information" on this company?

Dollar Tree competes in the dollar store and low-end retail markets. Each Dollar Tree stocks a variety of products including national, regional, and private-label brands. Departments found in a Dollar Tree store include health and beauty, food and snacks, party, seasonal décor, housewares, glassware, dinnerware, household cleaning supplies, candy, toys, gifts, gift bags and wrap, stationery, craft supplies, teaching supplies, automotive, electronics, pet supplies, and books. Most Dollar Tree stores also sell frozen foods and dairy items such as milk, eggs, pizza, ice cream, frozen dinners, and pre-made baked goods. In August 2012, the company began accepting manufacturer's coupons at all of its store locations.

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 1954, K. R. Perry[2] opened a Ben Franklin variety store in Norfolk, Virginia, which later became known as K&K 5&10. In 1970, K.R. Perry, Doug Perry, and Macon Brock started K&K Toys in Norfolk, Virginia. This mall concept grew to over 130 stores on the East Coast. In 1986, Doug Perry, Macon Brock, and Ray Compton started another chain store called Only $1.00 with five stores, one in Georgia, one in Tennessee, and three in Virginia. The expansion of Dollar Stores was continued alongside K&K Toys stores, mostly in enclosed malls. In 1991, the corporation made a decision to focus exclusively on the expansion of dollar stores after selling K&K stores to KB Toys, a Melville Corporation.
1990s[edit]
In 1993, the name Only $1.00 was changed to Dollar Tree Stores to address what could be a multi-price-point strategy in the future, and part equity interest was sold to SKM partners, a private equity firm.
On March 6, 1995, Dollar Tree, Inc. went public on the NASDAQ exchange at $15 a share, with a market cap then calculated at $225 million.
In 1996, Dollar Tree acquired Dollar Bill$, Inc., a Chicago-based chain of 136 stores.
In 1997, the company opened its first distribution center and its new store support center, both located in Chesapeake, Virginia.
In 1998, Dollar Tree acquired 98-Cent Clearance Centers in California.
In 1999, Dollar Tree acquired Only $One stores based in New York state. This same year, the company opened its second Distribution Center in Olive Branch, Mississippi.
2000s[edit]
In 2000, Dollar Tree acquired Dollar Express, a Philadelphia-based company, and also built a new distribution center in Stockton, California. In 2001, the company opened two additional distribution centers, in Savannah, Georgia, and Briar Creek, Pennsylvania. In 2003, Dollar Tree acquired Salt Lake City, Utah-based Greenbacks, Inc., and opened a new distribution center in Marietta, Oklahoma.




This Dollar Tree store in Northwood, Ohio, is the only store that continues to use the defunct Super Dollar Tree banner.


In 2004, Dollar Tree opened its first store in North Dakota which marked its operation of stores in all 48 contiguous states. The company also opened new distribution centers in Joliet, Illinois, and Ridgefield, Washington.
In 2006, Dollar Tree celebrated its 20th year of retailing at a $1.00 price point, opened its 3,000th store, and acquired 138 DEAL$ stores, previously owned by SUPERVALU INC.
In 2007, Dollar Tree expanded its Briar Creek Distribution Center, crossed the $4 billion sales threshold, and had a market capitalization of $3.29 billion. In 2008, Dollar Tree earned a place in the Fortune 500. By the close of 2009, the company opened a store in Washington, D.C., and purchased a new distribution center in San Bernardino, California.
In 2009, Dollar Tree redesigned its website with a new e-commerce platform. DollarTree.com sells Dollar Tree merchandise in larger quantities to individuals, small businesses, and organizations. The company also advertises in-store events, specials, seasonal promotions, and featured products through the site and users can locate a retail store, research information about Dollar Tree, and view product recalls. Dollar Tree also recently added customer ratings and reviews and customer stories to the site.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, the corporation opened its 4,000th chain store and acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant stores which are based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.
In 2011, Dollar Tree achieved total sales of $6.63 billion, opened 278 new stores, and completed a 400,000 square-foot expansion of its distribution center in Savannah, Georgia.
In 2012, Dollar Tree opened another 345 new stores and exceeded $7 billion in sales, with an end-of-the-year market cap at $9.13 billion.
On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced it was offering $9.2 billion for the purchase of competitor chain store Family Dollar. On August 18, 2014, Dollar General lodged a competing bid of $9.7 billion for Family Dollar.[3] The bid was rejected on August 20, 2014, by the Family Dollar board, which said it would proceed with the deal with Dollar Tree.[4]
In January 2015, Dollar Tree announced plans to divest 300 stores in order to appease US regulators scrutinizing its proposed takeover of Family Dollar stores.[5]
In June 2015, the firm agreed to sell 330 stores to private equity company Sycamore Partners as part of the approval process for its $8.5 billion takeover of Family Dollar.[6]
Business strategy[edit]
Dollar Tree is classified as an extreme discount store.[7] It claims to be able to achieve this because their buyers "work extremely hard to find the best bargains out there", and it has "great control over the tremendous buying power at the dollar price-point".[8] Its prices are primarily designed to attract those with financial difficulties, but it has also become popular with more affluent customers.[9]
Family Dollar bidding[edit]




Exterior of a store in Hillsboro, Oregon


On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that a deal had been reached and approved by both parties to purchase Family Dollar for $8.5 billion plus acquisition of the $1 billion in debt currently held by Family Dollar.[10][11][12] The deal came in the month following activist investor and major shareholder[13] Carl Icahn's demand that Family Dollar be promptly put up for sale.[14] After their reported deal had been struck, Dollar General entered the bidding, surpassing Dollar Tree's offer, with a $9.7 billion bid on August 18, 2014.[15] On August 20, 2014 Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. The Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General, since the start of the year a statement from CEO Howard Levine outlined.[4]
Canada[edit]
Main article: Dollar Tree Canada
In November 2010, Dollar Tree announced that it had acquired 86 Canadian Dollar Giant Stores based in Vancouver, British Columbia. The stores are operated in British Columbia, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan. These are the first retail locations outside of the United States operated by Dollar Tree.[16]
Recalls[edit]
The Consumer Product Safety Commission lists several recalls for products sold at Dollar Tree stores. The recalled products include salsa jars with broken glass inside them, hot-melt mini glue guns (recalled in January 2008) which could short circuit and cause burns[17] and candle sets (recalled in February 2004) which could produce excessive flame.[18]
