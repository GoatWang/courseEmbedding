InterMedia Partners VII, L.P. and InterMedia Outdoors Holdings, LLC Deliver Proposal to Outdoor Channel Holdings, Inc.

		  Proposed Offer to Acquire 100% of Outstanding Common Stock of Outdoor Channel at $9.15 per Share
		

Apr 30, 2013, 16:12 ET
		  		  					
						 from   InterMedia Outdoors Holdings, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, April 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- On April 30, 2013, InterMedia Partners VII, L.P. and InterMedia Outdoors Holdings, LLC (together, "InterMedia") delivered a written proposal to Outdoor Channel Holdings, Inc. ("Outdoor Channel") (Nasdaq:   OUTD), proposing to acquire, on the terms and conditions set forth in the proposal, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Outdoor Channel, at a price of $9.15 per share in cash (representing a superior proposal to Outdoor Channel's pending transaction with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, LLC).
InterMedia is publicly disclosing this letter to ensure that Outdoor Channel stockholders have an opportunity to benefit from its superior proposal.  A copy of the letter from InterMedia to Outdoor Channel is included below:
April 30, 2013 
Board of Directors
Outdoor Channel Holdings, Inc.
43455 Business Park Drive, Suite 103
Temecula, CA 92590 
Dear Members of the Board of Directors:
We are pleased to submit this definitive proposal to acquire Outdoor Channel Holdings, Inc. ("OUTD") in a transaction that will provide your stockholders with substantially greater value than they would receive under your currently pending merger agreement with Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, LLC ("KSE").
We propose to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of OUTD common stock in an all-cash transaction at a price of $9.15 per share, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this letter and the attached agreements. Our proposed transaction closely tracks your pending transaction with KSE in all material respects. Our proposal is definitive and fully financed as indicated in the attached commitment letter from two large institutional lenders.  As you know, we have already obtained antitrust approval in connection with our previous merger agreement, and we have confirmed that such approval remains effective.  Finally, our proposal is subject to limited confirmatory due diligence.  For the avoidance of doubt, any non-public information provided to us will be subject to our confidentiality agreement dated as of August 13, 2012.
Our proposal is clearly superior to the transaction with KSE as our per share cash price represents a premium over the cash price that your stockholders would receive under the merger agreement with KSE.  We are confident that you, after consultation with your outside legal counsel and financial advisors, will conclude that our proposal constitutes a superior proposal.  We are prepared to sign the merger agreement and support agreement in the forms attached to this letter, upon termination of the current agreements with KSE and confirmation that you have approved the transactions contemplated by our definitive proposal.
In light of your stockholders' meeting on May 8, 2013 to vote on the transaction with KSE, it is imperative that we take action immediately to ensure that your stockholders can take advantage of the value represented by our proposal. Accordingly, our offer will remain open until 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on Tuesday, May 7, 2013.
This letter itself does not create any legally binding obligation, liability or commitment by us concerning a proposed transaction, and there will be no legally binding agreement between us unless and until we enter into a definitive merger agreement.
We are confident that our proposal constitutes a superior proposal, and we are very pleased to be able to offer it to your stockholders.  If you have any questions or would like to discuss any aspect of our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Peter Kern or Jeffrey D. Marell at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP.
Sincerely,


INTERMEDIA PARTNERS VII, L.P.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
