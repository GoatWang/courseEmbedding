                    GE SILICONES
                
Helping Propel Ideas Skyward

                    When Neil Armstrong took his first small step on the moon’s surface on July 20, 1969, it wasn’t just a giant leap for mankind – it was a giant leap for GE Silicones. Armstrong took that step in moon boots featuring soles made from GE’s advanced silicone rubber. And today, materials from GE Silicones – now named Momentive – are used on every manned U.S. space flight.

A Companywide Culture of Operational Excellence
At Momentive, we believe that operational excellence demands that we use all resources efficiently—not only natural resources, but human resources as well. As a result, employees’ time must always be used resourcefully; after all, every hour spent on an unproductive task is a kind of waste. That’s why, throughout the entire Momentive organization, we incorporate Six Sigma methodology, to improve business processes and to reduce errors, so that we can optimize our efficiency and thus our long-term sustainability.

The Excellence of Environmental Sustainability
To embrace operational excellence is to embrace environmental sustainability. That’s why each of our facilities tracks the resources it uses and the waste it generates, including greenhouse gases (GHG). Along the way, we look for ways to enhance efficiencies and improve sustainability, and share such advancements and Success Metrics with our global network. Additionally, as a rule, we look for opportunities to recycle our water, lessening the overall volume of clean water needed and wastewater produced.

Momentive Performance Materials Inc. recently launched a new product line of pyrolytic boron nitride (PBN) crucibles, heaters and coatings for the enhancement of the production of copper, indium, gallium, selinide (CIGS) solar cells. Compared to other ceramic materials, PBN potentially provides a higher level of chemical and thermal stability and a lower total cost of ownership. Due to the relatively low wetting of PBN by most molten metals, it typically withstands the high temperature and high volume throughput demands of CIGS solar cell manufacturing with minimal deterioration. “We’re confident that our new pyrolytic boron nitride products will deliver exceptional performance and longevity for CIGS solar cell manufacturers,” said John Mariner, heater systems product manager, Momentive Quartz and Ceramics. “With these new products, we’ve built upon the capabilities of materials long used in the demanding semiconductor manufacturing environment.” PBN is an anistropic, high-temperature ceramic that exhibits a unique combination of high electrical resistance and good thermal conductivity. This non-toxic, non-porous compound is exceptionally pure by virtue of the synthesis process (high-temperature/low-press chemical vapor deposition). It can be deposited or easily machined into a wide variety of shapes, including crucibles, boats, tubes, bottles and machined plate products. As a coating on graphite, it may help protect heaters and evaporation sources from the corrosive effect of molten metals. PBN’s directional thermal conductivity provides excellent “heat spreading” capability for improved temperature uniformity. The combination of high strength, good thermal conductivity and a low coefficient of thermal expansion makes the materials extremely resistant to thermal shock. For additional information, call (800) 822-4322 or (440) 878-5700, or visit www.momentive.com.

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: June 02, 2010

 After nearly violating its loan covenants in 2009, Momentive Performance Materials, backed by its financial sponsor Apollo Global Management, took a variety of actions to restructure its debt. The restructuring steps included an open market repurchase of publicly held notes; a notes exchange; a loan-covenant waiver; and, finally, an attempted loan amendment that sought to extend the maturity of the loan used to finance the Momentive buyout. This case allows students to see different debt-restructuring options in one setting. The case protagonist is a fund investment manager at a large hedge fund that holds 3 percent of Momentive's syndicated loan. The decision point in the case is whether the investor should vote to amend the loan. The perspective of the investor allows students to understand tensions underlying the restructuring process. The case serves as a vehicle for discussing contractual and institutional differences between public debt and syndicated loans, and challenges in the restructuring of such debt.

Donna Abbott-Vlahos | Albany Business










 


Momentive's restructuring plan wiped away approximately $3 billion of the company's $4.17 billion debt. The company emerged with approximately $360 million in liquidity, Momentive officials reported Friday.
Momentive is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global Management LLC, a private equity investment firm headquartered in New York City.
Apollo purchased GE Advanced Materials eight years ago, which became Momentive Performance Materials. Momentive's silicones are used in products including bath and shower caulk, adhesive labels, foam products, cosmetics and tires. The company's quartz products are used in products including car engines and biomedical devices.




Momentive is organized into two operating companies, Momentive Performance Materials Inc. and Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc. Momentive Specialty Chemicals manufactures specialty resins and has its own capital structure.
Momentive emerges from bankruptcy with an independent senior management team and a board of directors from Momentive Specialty Chemicals. Momentive Performance Materials employs 1,272 at its Waterford plant, according to the Albany Business Review's Manufacturers List.
Momentive Performance Materials reported $2.4 billion in revenue in 2013, according to SEC filings.
The company maintained operations without layoffs during its restructuring.

                    GE SILICONES
                
Helping Propel Ideas Skyward

                    When Neil Armstrong took his first small step on the moon’s surface on July 20, 1969, it wasn’t just a giant leap for mankind – it was a giant leap for GE Silicones. Armstrong took that step in moon boots featuring soles made from GE’s advanced silicone rubber. And today, materials from GE Silicones – now named Momentive – are used on every manned U.S. space flight.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code
