Omni Event Strategy Omni Event follows an actively traded global event-driven strategy with a focus on equity and equity-related securities of companies undergoing significant corporate actions and other hard catalyst events.
The strategy's mandate is event-driven in the truest sense, with Omni Event investing predominantly in announced transactions. CIO, John Melsom, strives to enter the best risk/reward trades without being constrained by pre-defined geographic or industry exposure requirements. John targets events that he believes have a high degree of certainty and will increase Omni Event's exposure to these events as their outcomes become clearer.
Omni Event's investment portfolio is built opportunistically, and its composition at any given time depends wholly on the available set of investable events in the market. In constructing the fund's portfolio, the investment team monitors a broad range of events in equity markets around the world and distils the global opportunity set to those events offering the best risk/reward profile. During this process, the Omni Event team seeks to become experts on the nuances of each trade by conducting research on all relevant variables surrounding each event, including the following:


Technical aspects of the transaction


Legal and regulatory issues


Political considerations


Broader corporate landscape


Company fundamentals


Market views


Overall macroeconomic environment

Omni Event Risk Management
Actively managing downside risk is vital in the delivery of consistent absolute returns. It is the investment team's key belief that the market will always offer opportunities to make profits, but it is the avoidance of loss that is paramount in maintaining consistently positive performance.
As a result of the thorough research and analysis that the investment team undertakes, the CIO is able to acquire strong conviction in the transactions in which he invests. This results in a relatively concentrated portfolio, where a limited number of positions constitute most of the risk in the portfolio.
Downside risk is mitigated by the use of a full range of risk management approaches including hedging positions, setting position size limits based on potential loss, employing tight stop-losses (including hard stops) and cutting positions in the event of inexplicable or exceptional share price movement.

Omni Secured Lending Strategy Omni Secured Lending extends short-term loans to professional UK property investors.
All loans are secured against UK real estate (in England, Wales or Scotland), with a maximum LTV of 75%. Loans typically fund refurbishment projects or the acquisition of buy-to-let / other investment properties.
Premium pricing is obtained in exchange for speed and certainty of execution. The strategy offers strong security coverage – all lending is full recourse and the UK has a proven creditor-friendly legal system.
Lending is conducted by the specialist lending platform, Amicus Finance Plc ("Amicus"). Active in specialty finance since 2009, Amicus has proven itself as a professional player within the space. Since inception the firm has extended finance in excess of £1bn. Principal losses experienced have been <0.1% to date.
Access to the market is provided via fund structures for sophisticated investors.
For further details, please contact the Investor Relations team:

+44 (0)20 3540 1600
investorrelations@omni.co.uk


Omni Secured Lending Risk Management
Loans are priced individually based upon perceived risk. The property serves as the primary risk measure during underwriting. Other core considerations are exit viability and the borrower’s creditworthiness / experience.
The strategy focuses on first charge (i.e. senior lien) lending. Adequate asset backing is required on each loan, with the “V” in LTV equal to the current open market valuation provided by a professional third party surveyor.
Full recourse results in enhanced security for lenders. Within UK property lending borrowers are held personally liable for their debt. Borrowers can be pursued by lenders for any shortfall suffered.
When work-out is required the creditor-friendly UK legal systems is helpful. A dedicated internal collections and servicing team is responsible for any enforcement action required.

	Omni Partners LLP ("Omni" and/or the "Firm") is an investment manager founded by Steven Clark in 2004.

Omni serves as investment manager of three strategies: Omni Macro, Omni Event and Omni Secured Lending. Across these strategies the firm has combined assets under management of more than $789 million.

The firm is headquartered in London, United Kingdom and has a second office in Irvine, California, United States. Omni owns a subsidiary in London called Amicus Finance Plc ("Amicus") and also owns a stake in Brookland Partners LLP, a leading independent real estate investment banking firm.
 
The firm is focused on providing access to products that aim to consistently deliver absolute returns. Each of the Omni strategies benefits from the institutional infrastructure put in place over the past ten years and Omni’s core risk philosophy, which emphasises the achievement of opportunistic returns whilst limiting downside risk via proactive risk control. As such, Omni has tailored a strict risk management framework to each strategy, an approach the firm believes has enabled it to deliver on its commitment to capital preservation.

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

                                            Electro Savings approve loans under a different set of rules to African Americans than Caucasian customers!  I was 7% above their threshold and when I asked to add a cosigner the answer was still NO!   DO NOT PATRONIZE!
