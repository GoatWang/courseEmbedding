Mcdonnell, Bernard J. - tribunedigital-thecourant







 


 Home→Collections→Test EngineerMcdonnell, Bernard J.August 10, 2006McDONNELL, Bernard J.Bernard J. McDonnell ('Bernie') of Jupiter, FL passed away peacefully on Tuesday (August 8, 2006) with his family at his bedside. Born on September 23, 1926 in Wilmington, DE to Bernard and Katherine McDonnell, he resided in the Jupiter/Tequesta area since 1971. He attended the University of Delaware from 1947-1951, graduating with a Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering. Bernie worked for Pratt & Whitney starting in 1951 as a test engineer, retiring in 1987 as the Vice President of Engineering - Government Products Division. He was a veteran of the U.S. Air Force, a member of the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board from 1982-1986, and served on the Board of Directors for Jupiter Hospital from 1988-1999. Along with his business career, Bernie was a devoted husband, father and grandfather. He was a devout Catholic and a parishioner at St. Jude Catholic Church. With his passing, we suffer the loss of a true gentleman. His dignity and compassion were known by all, and he led both in his personal and professional life by example, always striving to do what was right. Recreationally, Bernie enjoyed many years as an avid golfer and bowler, and was a member of the Tequesta Country Club. He is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Jane; his four sons, Michael of Anchorage, Alaska; Thomas (Mary) of Port Aransas, TX; Kevin (Loreta) of Kennebunkport, ME; and James (Patricia) of Keene, NH; his two daughters, Joan Sohl of Stuart, FL; and Catherine Anderson (Dan) of Chicago, IL; his sisters, Patricia Davis (Blair), and Eileen Reese (Willard); and 13 grandchildren. A vigil service will be held on Thursday evening at Taylor and Modine Funeral Home in Jupiter from 6 to 8 p.m. The Funeral Mass will be held on Friday, August 11, at 1 p.m. at St. Jude's Catholic Church in Jupiter. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Alzheimer's Association (www.alz.org, 4700 N. Congress Avenue, West Palm Beach, Fl 33407) or Hospice of Palm Beach County (www.hpbc.com, 5300 East Avenue, West Palm Beach, FL 33407).

These techniques are not new, but they have been significantly improved and strengthened in the past few years by the development of new high technology instrumentation and sophisticated computerized design prediction methods.
