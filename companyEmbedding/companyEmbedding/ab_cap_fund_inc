The performance shown represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.
Performance for AB Sustainable Global Thematic Fund reflects a 4.33% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Large Cap Growth Fund reflects a 0.38% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Growth and Income Fund reflects a 0.18% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Discovery Growth Fund reflects a 0.13% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Performance for AB Growth Fund reflects a 0.22% increase in NAV on June 8, 2016 for all share classes as a result of the Fund recording a receivable on its books and records in connection with the distribution by the Alliance Fair Fund.   

Net Expense Ratio reflects the Adviser’s contractual waiver of a portion of its advisory fee and/or reimbursement of a portion of the Fund’s operating expenses.  This waiver and/or reimbursement extends through a particular date as specified in the Fund’s current prospectus, and may be further extended or terminated by the Adviser as set forth in the prospectus.  Absent waivers and/or reimbursements, performance would have been lower.


Performance for Classes R, K, I, Z and Advisor shares prior to the share class’ inception date is simulated based on the historical performance of the Class A shares, adjusted for typical estimated expenses. Please note the inception dates for the Funds. As of January 31, 2009, Class B shares are no longer available for purchase by new investors. For additional information, see the Fund’s current prospectus.

If applicable, please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Fund returns are annualized for periods longer than one year. The NAV does not take into account any sales charges that may apply when shares are purchased or redeemed; if sales charges were reflected, the Fund’s quoted performance would be lower. Class A annualized returns with sales charge reflect the deduction of the maximum sales charge: 3.00% for municipal fixed income funds; 4.25% for all other funds. Prior to October 1, 2009 the maximum front-end sales charge for Class A shares of the municipal fixed income funds was 4.25%. If the Class A annualized returns for the municipal income funds reflected the deduction of the former maximum sales charge, their returns would be lower. Class B shares of Equity Funds and the Unconstrained Bond Fund are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge equal to 4% in year 1, 3% in year 2, 2% in year 3, and 1% in year 4 (or, for Fixed Income Funds, except Unconstrained Bond, 3% in year 1, 2% in year 2 and 1% in year 3). Class C shares of all Funds are subject to a 1-year, 1% contingent deferred sales charge. Returns for Advisor Class, Class R, Class K, Class Z, Class I and Class 2 are at NAV and carry no front-end or contingent deferred sales charges. Returns for Class R shares are without the imposition of a sales charge that would apply if shares were purchased outside of a group retirement plan.



The net asset value (NAV) price is the value of one share of the Portfolio as of the date listed. The NAV does not take into account any initial sales charges that may apply when shares are purchased or redemption charges when shares are sold; if these sales charges were reflected, the Portfolio's quoted performance would be lower. The NAV change is the change in value of one share of the Portfolio from the prior day's value.

Distribution yield is calculated on a 30-day rolling basis by annualizing the average of the dividends distributed over the most recent 30 day period, and dividing that figure by the current NAV. For the AB Bond Inflation Strategy Fund and the AB Municipal Bond Inflation Strategy Fund, distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly dividend distribution and dividing that figure by the current NAV. The distribution yield calculation does not include long-term or short-term capital gains distributions.
A Word About Risk: Because each Fund pursues its own unique investment objectives, each Fund has its own set of risks which are fully discussed in its prospectus. In order to achieve their investment objectives, some Funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. For Funds that can invest in foreign securities, which may include emerging markets securities, risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries. Portfolios that hold a smaller number of securities may be more volatile than more diversified portfolios. 
Funds that invest in small-cap and mid-cap stocks are often more volatile than large-cap stocks—smaller companies generally face higher risks due to their limited product lines, markets and financial resources. Funds that invest in real estate are subject to a variety of factors affecting the real estate market, such as economic conditions, mortgage rates and availability, which can cause the value of such investments to decline. REITs may have additional risks due to limited diversification and the impact of tax law changes.
Funds that invest in fixed income securities are subject to decreasing bond prices as interest rates rise and increasing bond prices as interest rates fall. The values of mortgage related securities and asset-backed securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk. In addition, a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal—the lower the rating, the higher the risk of default. If the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates, the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline. Funds that invest in debt securities issued by state or local governments may be subject to special political, legal, economic and market factors that can have a significant effect on the portfolio’s yield or value.
Lipper rankings are based on total returns at net asset value, without the imposition of a sales charge which would reduce total return figures.

Lipper averages represent the average returns of funds contained in the Lipper universe. Funds in the Lipper averages generally have similar investment objectives to the Funds, although some may have different investment policies. Investors can’t invest directly in indices or averages, and their returns don’t represent the performance of any AllianceBernstein mutual fund.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund/Portfolio carefully before investing. For copies of our prospectus or summary prospectus, which contain this and other information, click here or contact your AB representative. Please read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before investing. 

AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc. (ABI) is the distributor of the AB family of mutual funds. ABI is a member of  FINRA  and is an affiliate of AllianceBernstein L.P., the manager of the funds.

The annualized asset-based fees for each of the Education Strategies portfolios is based on each portfolio’s total estimated operating expenses plus a weighted average of the expense ratios of the mutual funds in which it invests. Each Education Strategies portfolio’s actual expenses may be higher or lower depending on its actual operating expenses, its allocation percentages among various mutual funds (for the Age-Based and Fixed Allocation portfolios), and the actual expenses of the underlying mutual funds, each of which is likely to change over time.

Portfolio returns are annualized for periods longer than one year.  The NAV does not take into account any initial sales charges that may apply when shares are purchased or redemption charges when shares are sold; if these sales charges were reflected, the Portfolio’s quoted performance would be lower.

If applicable, please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

Sales Charges: 1y, 3y, 5y, 10y and Since Inception returns include fees, expenses and reinvested distributions and payment of the maximum initial sales charge or contingent redemption charge. The maximum initial sales charge applicable to Alternative A (Class A) shares is 4.25%. The redemption charge applicable to Alternative B (Class B) shares varies according to the number of years from the time a contribution was made until its withdrawal as follows: year one, 4%; year two, 3%; year three, 2%; year four, 1%; year five or later, 0%. The redemption charge applicable to Alternative C (Class C) shares is 1% for the first year after a contribution is made. The maximum initial sales charge applicable to Alternative RZ (Class RZ) shares is 4.00%.

The performance for Class RI shares prior to 8/27/10, the share class’s inception date, reflects Class R share performance, adjusted for differences in total annual asset-based fees. The inception date for Class R shares is referenced in the table above.
If you are invested in an Age-Based Portfolio, please refer to the performance of the portfolio that corresponds with the beneficiary’s date of birth.

Special note: The share class designation for accounts established prior to February 8, 2002 as well as certain accounts established after February 8, 2002 has changed. These “old” A, B and C share classes have been renamed AX, BX and CX, respectively. Please refer to your most recent account statement or contact CollegeBoundfund at (888) 324-5057 to determine which class of shares you own.
Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of CollegeBoundfund carefully before investing. For a copy of the Program Description, which contains this and other information, click here, or call your financial representative or AB at (888) 324-5057. Please read the Program Description carefully before investing.

If you are not a Rhode Island resident or if you have taxable income in another state, please note that depending on the laws of your or your beneficiary’s home state, favorable state tax treatment or other benefits offered by such a home state for investing in 529 college savings plans may be available only for investments in the home state’s 529 plan. Any state-based benefit offered with respect to this plan should be one of many appropriately weighted factors to be considered before making an investment decision. Please consult your financial, tax or other adviser to learn more about how state-based benefits (including any limitations) would apply to your specific circumstances. You may also wish to contact your home state or another state’s 529 plan to learn more about its features, benefits and limitations before investing. Statements in this material concerning taxation are not offered as individual tax advice.

The investments in CollegeBoundfund are not guaranteed by the State of Rhode Island, the office of the General Treasurer of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island State Investment Commission (which oversees the investments of the assets of CollegeBoundfund), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any instrumentality thereof. CollegeBoundfund is managed by AllianceBernstein L.P. and distributed by AllianceBernstein Investments, Inc., member FINRA.
Investors should consider many factors before deciding which 529 plan is most appropriate for their situation. Some of these include: the Plan’s investment options and the historical investment performance of these options, the Plan’s flexibility and features, the reputation and expertise of the Plan’s investment manager, Plan contribution limits and the federal and state tax benefits associated with an investment in the Plan. Some states, for example, offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own qualified tuition program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan or contact their state tax division for more information. 
AB mutual funds may be offered only to persons in the United States and by way of a prospectus. This website should not be considered a solicitation or offering of any investment products or services to investors residing outside of the United States. 


Net Expense Ratio reflects the Adviser’s contractual waiver of a portion of its advisory fee and/or reimbursement of a portion of the Fund’s operating expenses. This waiver and/or reimbursement extends through a particular date as specified in the Fund’s most recent Annual or Semi-Annual Shareholder Report. Absent waivers and/or reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

The Market Price is the price at which a Fund’s shares are traded on an exchange. Because a closed-end exchange-traded fund’s shares trade in the stock market based on investor demand, the fund may trade at a price higher or lower than its NAV. An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest. Your investment in a Fund's shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Fund, substantially all of which are traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. The value of these securities, like other market investments, may move up or down, sometimes unpredictably. Your exchange-traded shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions.


A Word About Risk: Because each Fund pursues its own unique investment objectives, each Fund has its own set of risks. Fixed income Funds invest principally in bonds and other fixed income securities, in order to achieve their investment objectives, the Funds may at times use certain types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps. These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than, the risks presented by investments that are more traditional. Funds may at times use financial leverage for investment purposes. Leverage tries to enhance investment returns by borrowing money or using other leverage tools—magnify both gains and losses, resulting in greater volatility. The Funds may use Auction Rate Preferred Stocks as well as TOBs, which result in leverage and therefore higher risk. For Funds that can invest in foreign securities, which may include emerging markets securities, risks may be magnified due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries.

"Morningstar Style BoxYahoo partners with Morningstar a leading market research and investment data group to help investors rate and compare funds on Yahoo Finance. The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryMultialternativeFund FamilyAllianceBernsteinNet Assets209.51MYTD Return1.34%Yield18.68%Morningstar RatingN/A1Inception DateMar 8, 2015Fund OperationsLast Dividend1.47Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover429.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseAARCXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)2.28%1.55%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio1.99%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio4.62%N/AMax 12b1 Fee1.00%N/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/A5.18%Max Deferred Sales Load1.00%1.23%3 Yr Expense Projection1,158N/A5 Yr Expense Projection2,121N/A10 Yr Expense Projection4,560N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
