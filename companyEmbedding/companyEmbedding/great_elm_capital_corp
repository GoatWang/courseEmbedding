(NYSE:GEC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Great Elm Capital Group, Inc.: A Favorable Risk-Reward Investment OpportunityOct. 3.16 | About: Great Elm (GEC) Revere Investing Long/short equity, value, CFASummaryDownside valuation more than 10% above current share price.Upside valuation multiples of current share price.Opportunity to monetize massive NOLs could lead to huge upside.Great Elm Capital Group (NYSE:GEC) is a publicly traded holding company whose strategy is to invest its capital in investment management, financial products and merchant banking businesses. The company's balance sheet carries $1.7 billion of federal NOLs, all of which were generated from businesses that have been divested. Great Elm Capital Group (Great Elm) closed on the sale of its patent business on June 30, 2016, for upfront gross proceeds of $30 million, with the potential for an additional $10 million to be received on June 30, 2018. Following the redemption of all legacy debt, anticipated by October 18, 2016, the company will be debt-free and own through its $30 million investment in Great Elm Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:GECC), a piece of a newly created business development company that will hold primarily debt instruments of middle-market companies. Great Elm will also own 100% of Great Elm Capital Management (GECM), which will manage GECC, from which it will earn investment management and incentive fees.  Great Elm Capital Group (Great Elm) NASDAQ:GEC   $30 million investment in Great Elm Capital Corp. 100% ownership of Great Elm Capital Management $10 million contingent payment on June 2018 from the sale of a patent portfolio $1.7 billion federal NOLs.  Great Elm Capital Corp. - $30 million value GECC is a newly formed, externally managed non-diversified closed-end management company that will be regulated as a BDC. GECC will seek to generate current income and capital appreciation through the ownership of debt securities of middle-market companies. On June 23, 2016, GECC entered into a merger agreement with Full Circle Capital Corp (FULL) whereby FULL will merge an approximately $72 million portfolio into GECC. GECC will also receive a $30 million cash investment from Great Elm and prior to the closing of the FULL transaction, GECC will acquire a portfolio from MAST Funds valued at approximately $89 million. The resulting portfolio with a NAV of about $191 million will be managed by GECM. Even though I expect the value of Great Elm's investment in GECC to appreciate by around 10% over the coming year, I am conservatively valuing its stake in GECC at cost, or $30 million.
 Great Elm Capital Management - $16.5 million value Great Elm will own 100% of GECM, which will be the investment advisor to GECC. GECM will earn a 1.50% management fee plus a 20% incentive fee above a 7% annualized hurdle. I estimate GECC will earn a management fee of $3.75 million (1.50% X $250 million gross assets) and that the fund earns a 10% return, before fees, which would generate an incentive fee of roughly $1.5 million, for total revenues of $5.25 million. I estimate an initial net profit margin of 45% of revenues, which could rise over time if the fund grows through acquisitions and benefits from scale. Under this scenario, first year after tax net income will amount to $2.36 million. Considerable upside exists to revenue and profits due to potential outperformance of certain GECC holdings. Contingent Proceeds From Sale of Patent Business Due June, 2018 - $5 million value On June 30, 2016 Great Elm (formerly Unwired Planet) closed on the sale of its patent business to PanOptis for $30 million in cash and a $10 million contingent payment due June 30, 2018. I believe it is highly probable that Great Elm will receive the $10 million payment on June 30, 2018, but estimate its risk-adjusted net present value to be $5 million to be conservative. $1.7 billion in Federal Net Operating Losses - $57 to $114 million value Great Elm retains $1.7 billion in NOLs due to losses dating back to the 1990s from software businesses that have been divested. With a top federal tax rate of 39.6%, the undiscounted value of the NOLs amounts to $673 million. Normally a company, such as Great Elm, would use its NOLs to offset income from businesses acquired but the magnitude of Great Elm's NOLs would require a large amount of debt and equity for size sufficient acquisitions. So much equity, in fact, that NOL monetization would need to take place over many, many years to avoid the limitation due to IRS ownership change of control rules that equity issuance would trigger. I believe highly structured transactions could monetize a large portion, if not all, of the NOLs over the next 12 months by creating bespoke financial products that require little to no capital investment from Great Elm. The sharing of the NOL tax shield between GEC and third parties could produce anywhere from roughly $50 million to $100 million in proceeds to GEC, in my estimation. Indeed, the creation of its BDC, Great Elm Capital Corp., may be the first step toward unlocking the value of its NOLs.
 Announced Rights Offering On September 13, 2016, the company announced a $45 million capital raise through a backstopped rights offering, which will allow the company to retire high-priced payment-in-kind (pik) debt. The rights offering's record date should occur within the next 30 days. It is notable that funds managed by MAST Capital, which owns over 18% of the company's shares, and all GEC board members will participate in the rights offering. I view the participation by these parties as positive, especially the participation of board member Jess Ravitch, whom has deep experience in unlocking the value of NOLs. Ravitch's ALJ Regional Holdings (OTCPK:ALJJ) is up over 10X since 2012. Shareholders of record on the record date will experience very little dilution in this under-valued company, should they exercise their rights, which I recommend. Summary I estimate GEC to be worth, before the capital raise, $5.48 per share at a minimum. I arrive at this downside valuation by adding the sum of the following parts:   Investment in GECC @ cost $30 million   GECM ($2.36 million X 7 multiple) $16.5 million   Risk adjusted PV of June 2018 patent sale payment $5 million   SOTP excluding NOL $51.5 million   Shares Outstanding 9.4 million   Downside value per share $5.48   The table below establishes upside scenarios based on NOL monetization. Each column represents a different percentage share of the NOL shield to be retained by Great Elm, discounted back one year by 15%.     10% share 15% share 20% share   NOL NPV $57 million $86 million $114 million   SOTP ex-NOL $51.5 million $51.5 million $51.5 million   Total Upside Value $108.5 million $137.5 million $165.5 million   Shares outstanding 9.4 million 9.4 million 9.4 million   Per share upside value $11.1 $14.63 $17.61   With a downside of $5.48 per share and upside as high as $17.23, GEC shares offer a favorable asymmetric investment opportunity.

Investor Relations


 



 















Great Elm Capital Group, Inc. (“Great Elm”) is a publicly-traded holding company. Over the next five years, Great Elm intends to build a diversified investment company comprised of the following three business lines: investment management, real estate and merchant banking.
 


INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT The Great Elm Capital Management (“GECM”) investment team has deep experience investing in leveraged middle market companies. The GECM team has deployed more than $17 billion into credit investments in more than 550 issuers across 20+ jurisdictions over its 14-year history under MAST Capital Management, LLC (“MAST”). Led by Chief Investment Officer Peter A. Reed, GECM’s investment team has more than 100 years of experience in the aggregate financing and investing in leveraged middle market companies.
Great Elm’s first investment vehicle is Great Elm Capital Corp. (“GECC”), a business development company.
REAL ESTATE
Great Elm seeks to acquire real estate assets in upper-tier metropolitan statistical areas that are both characterized by long-term, residual value and financed with high leverage. Great Elm focuses on properties currently leased by investment grade tenants, using tax-sheltered income from the lessee to service the debt Great Elm borrows to purchase the property. Great Elm is pursuing credit tenant lease financings, ground lease structures and secondary market property purchases. Great Elm is an enduring real estate investor with a keen focus on preservation of capital. 
MERCHANT BANKING Building on our team’s experience in long-term investing, Great Elm intends to leverage its core competencies in M&A and leveraged finance to buy, grow and hold high quality businesses in attractive industries. Great Elm intends to build a portfolio of control investments with a view toward owning these companies for the long-term. Great Elm will then seek to grow these portfolio companies both organically and through M&A.

Investor Relations


 



 















Great Elm Capital Group, Inc. (“Great Elm”) is a publicly-traded holding company. Over the next five years, Great Elm intends to build a diversified investment company comprised of the following three business lines: investment management, real estate and merchant banking.
 


INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT The Great Elm Capital Management (“GECM”) investment team has deep experience investing in leveraged middle market companies. The GECM team has deployed more than $17 billion into credit investments in more than 550 issuers across 20+ jurisdictions over its 14-year history under MAST Capital Management, LLC (“MAST”). Led by Chief Investment Officer Peter A. Reed, GECM’s investment team has more than 100 years of experience in the aggregate financing and investing in leveraged middle market companies.
Great Elm’s first investment vehicle is Great Elm Capital Corp. (“GECC”), a business development company.
REAL ESTATE
Great Elm seeks to acquire real estate assets in upper-tier metropolitan statistical areas that are both characterized by long-term, residual value and financed with high leverage. Great Elm focuses on properties currently leased by investment grade tenants, using tax-sheltered income from the lessee to service the debt Great Elm borrows to purchase the property. Great Elm is pursuing credit tenant lease financings, ground lease structures and secondary market property purchases. Great Elm is an enduring real estate investor with a keen focus on preservation of capital. 
MERCHANT BANKING Building on our team’s experience in long-term investing, Great Elm intends to leverage its core competencies in M&A and leveraged finance to buy, grow and hold high quality businesses in attractive industries. Great Elm intends to build a portfolio of control investments with a view toward owning these companies for the long-term. Great Elm will then seek to grow these portfolio companies both organically and through M&A.
