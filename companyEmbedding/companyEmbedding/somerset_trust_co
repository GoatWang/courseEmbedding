"At Somerset Trust Company, we are committed to understanding our customers, our communities and one another in order to not only meet their banking needs, but to exceed expectations every day."

 About Us & A Brief History  
Our mission as an independent community bank has remained unchanged for over 125 years. We are committed to providing excellent service and competitive products as well as maintaining a high profile in the growth and economic development of the markets we serve.
In 1889, the town of Somerset, described by a newspaper at that time as “an aggressive mountain town”, was growing with a population of almost 4,000. Businessmen and community leaders realized the emerging need for a local bank if their community was to continue to thrive. Congressman and Civil War veteran Edward Scull, and the fourth of his six sons, George R. Scull, turned that vision into a reality when they established what was to become Somerset Trust Company.
That independent community vision still exists today at Somerset Trust. Now under the leadership and guidance of the fifth generation of the Scull family, the bank has endeavored to enhance the traditional qualities of community banking by effectively using technology to support excellent service to customers.

Thank You STC!

"Somerset Trust makes banking easy for business customers"


Thank you for being a company that supports local business! Your extended hours and online services allow me to bank on my schedule. Thank you!








Mike Zeiger
Great Customer Service!

"Every branch I've been to has excellent service."


Though I do not live in the area, i have kept STC as my bank because they have gracious staff, no hassle checking accounts, and great lending programs. They provide friendly service and answer any questions you have. They even remembered my birthday was coming up! Every branch I've been to has excellent service. Thank you STC!

Welcome to the Somerset Trust Company Mortgage Department 

 As your community lender, we offer the best mortgage tools available online and in-person. Convenient pre-qualification and application tools, current and competitive rates, and direct access to lending personnel to assist you with this often difficult and confusing process. In addition to conventional mortgages we work with multiple types of programs to make financing easier, such as the First Front Door, USDA Guaranteed loans  and Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency funding options. Once your loan is finalized, we handle the servicing of payments and any questions you have can be answered at a branch near you!

	 







Purchasing a new home? 

					Congratulations on your decision to buy a new home! There are many important things to consider throughout the process, especially if you're a first-time homebuyer.







Applying for a loan? 

					Our online application process is conveniently designed to allow you to stop any time and pick up where you left off. After you submit an application, you can check loan status at your convenience.







Remodeling your home?

					If you are planning on remodeling your home - be it a kitchen, bathroom or backyard - you can contact one of our mortgage professionals who will help find the right loan for you.
