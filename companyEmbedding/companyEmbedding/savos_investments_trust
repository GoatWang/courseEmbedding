Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Overview                                                                        

 Centurion U.S. Contra Fund (the "Fund") is a diversified investment portfolio
of Centurion Funds, Inc. (the "Company"), a no-load mutual fund complex. The    
Fund is designed for professional money managers and knowledgeable investors    
who intend to invest in the Fund as part of a strategic or tactical asset       
allocation investment strategy. The Fund is not designed to be a stand-alone    
investment vehicle, but rather is to be used with certain other investments to  
provide a balance to the risks inherent in those investments.                   

Only investors who have entered into an investment management agreement with
certain registered investment advisers ("Investment Professionals") and have a  
custodial relationship with Centurion Trust Company ("Centurion Trust") are     
currently eligible to buy shares of the Fund. Investment Professionals provide  
investors asset allocation recommendations with respect to the Fund and other   
mutual funds based on an evaluation of an investor's investment goals, risk     
preferences and investment time horizons. The Fund was developed to afford      
Investment Professionals ready access to certain strategies designed to         
facilitate their management of the risks inherent in allocating their clients'  
assets among other available investment options. Fees paid to Investment        
Professionals for their services are in addition to the operating expenses of   
the Fund discussed in this Prospectus. Investors should consult their           
Investment Professional if in doubt about their fees.                           

Centurion Trust currently serves as custodial agent for investors who are   
eligible to invest in the Fund. Centurion Trust also serves as investment       
manager to the Fund that makes up the Company. Centurion Trust has engaged      
Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("CSAM") as a sub-adviser to manage all or  
a portion of the Fund's portfolio according to its investment goal and          
strategies.                                                                     

Investment in the Fund involves special risks, some not traditionally       
associated with mutual funds. Investors should carefully review and evaluate    
these risks when considering an investment in the Fund. The Fund alone does not 
constitute a balanced investment plan.                                          

                                                                           1

Investments, Risks and Performance                                              

GOAL AND STRATEGIES                                                             

The Fund seeks to provide protection against declines in the value of the   
U.S. equity allocation of certain assets custodied with Centurion Trust (the    
"U.S. Equity Benchmark"). This investment goal may be changed by the Board of   
Directors without shareholder approval.                                         

Centurion Trust analyzes the various mutual funds held by certain of its    
clients (the "Custodied Funds"), as well as the portfolio securities of these   
funds. Centurion Trust performs its analysis based on information provided by   
the Custodied Funds and/or, because these funds are not required to report      
their securities holdings to Centurion Trust, by reviewing the historic         
securities holdings of the Custodied Funds as described in public documents     
(which are required to be made available at least semi-annually within 60 days  
after the close of the applicable reporting period). Based on the information   
available, Centurion Trust attempts to determine the composition of the U.S.    
Equity Benchmark, including the relative proportion of the underlying assets    
maintained in various asset classes, geographic locations and industries, in    
order to advise CSAM, the Fund's sub-adviser, of the level and nature of the    
downside protection specifically desired for the U.S. Equity Benchmark at any   
moment in time. CSAM then uses statistical and quantitative analysis to select  
investments designed to provide protection against declines in the performance  
of the U.S. Equity Benchmark.                                                   

Centurion Trust and CSAM intend to pursue the Fund's investment goal        
regardless of market conditions and will not invest the Fund's portfolio, in    
the aggregate, in anticipation of rising U.S. equity prices.                    

PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS                                                           
To achieve its investment goal, the Fund intends to use the following       
instruments:                                                                    
.options on securities and stock indexes;                                   
.stock index futures contracts;                                             
.options on stock index futures contracts; and                              
.DIAMONDS (Dow Jones Industrial Average Model New Depositary Shares) and    
SPDRs (Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts); these are securities issued
by investment companies holding a portfolio of securities that is intended
to track the performance and dividend yield of the Dow Jones Industrial   
  Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (the "S&P Index"), respectively.

To the extent that the Fund invests in DIAMONDS or SPDRs, the Fund will     
indirectly bear its proportionate share of the expenses of the underlying       
investment vehicle issuing these instruments. The Fund's investments in         
securities of other investment companies, such as DIAMONDS or SPDRs, are        
subject to limitations under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Investments, Risks and Performance (continued)                                  

As a cash reserve, for liquidity purposes or as "cover" for positions it has
taken, the Fund may temporarily invest all or part of the Fund's assets in cash 
or cash equivalents. The Fund may also engage, to a limited extent, in other    
investment practices in order to achieve its investment goal.                   

 The Fund will not invest 25% or more of its total assets in the securities of
one or more issuers conducting their principal business activities in the same  
industry. This limitation does not apply to investments or obligations of the   
U.S. Government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.                    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

The Fund is subject to the following principal risk factors:                

Available Information Risk. Because the mutual funds held by Centurion      
Trust's clients are not required to report their securities holdings to         
Centurion Trust, Centurion Trust may be unable to determine current market      
exposure of the U.S. Equity Benchmark, and thus may have imperfect knowledge of 
the exact risks to be hedged.                                                   

Derivatives Risk. The Fund's use of options, futures and options on futures 
("derivatives") involves additional risks and transaction costs, such as, (i)   
adverse changes in the value of these instruments, (ii) imperfect correlation   
between the price of derivatives and movements in the price of the underlying   
securities, index or futures contracts, (iii) the fact that use of derivatives  
requires different skills than those needed to select portfolio securities, and 
(iv) the possible absence of a liquid secondary market for a particular         
derivative at any moment in time.                                               

Exposure Risk. Certain investments (such as options and futures) and certain
practices may have the effect of magnifying declines as well as increases in    
the Fund's net asset value. Losses from buying and selling futures can be       
unlimited.                                                                      

Market Risk. The market value of a security may move up and down, sometimes 
rapidly and unpredictably. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods   
of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. These fluctuations  
may cause a security to be worth less than the price originally paid for it, or 
less than it was worth at an earlier time. Market risk may affect a single      
issuer, industry, sector of the economy or the market as a whole. Market risk   
is common to most investments, including stocks and bonds, and the mutual funds 
that invest in them.                                                            

 Portfolio Turnover Rate Risk. The Company anticipates that investors that are
part of a tactical or strategic asset allocation strategy may frequently redeem 
or exchange shares of the Fund, which will cause the Fund to experience higher  
portfolio turnover. A higher portfolio turnover rate may result in the Fund     
paying more brokerage commissions and generating greater tax liabilities for    
shareholders. Additionally, high portfolio turnover may adversely affect the    
ability of the Fund to meet its investment goals.                               

                                                                           3

Investments, Risks and Performance (continued)                                  

Regulatory Risk. Positions in futures and related options will be entered   
into only to the extent they constitute permissible positions for the Fund      
according to applicable rules of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. At   
times, the Fund may be constrained in its ability to use futures, options on    
futures or other derivatives by an unanticipated inability to close positions   
when it would be most advantageous to do so. Additionally, to the extent that   
the Fund engages in futures and related options for other than "bona fide"      
hedging purposes, aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish   
these positions may not exceed 5% of the Fund's net asset value.                

Trading Halt Risk. Certain major exchanges on which options and futures     
contracts are traded, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, have established 
limits on how much an option or futures contract may decline over various time  
periods within a day. If an option or futures contract's price declines more    
than the established limits, trading on the exchange is halted on that          
instrument. If a trading halt occurs before the close of a trading day, the     
Fund may not be able to purchase or sell options or futures contracts. In such  
an event, the Fund also may be required to use a "fair-value" method to price   
its outstanding contracts.                                                      

 The value of your investment in the Fund is designed to increase during times
when the value of the U.S. Equity Benchmark is decreasing. Conversely, when the 
value of the U.S. Equity Benchmark increases, the value of your investment in   
the Fund should decrease. To the extent that the Fund invests in certain        
securities, the Fund may be affected by additional risks as discussed in "More
About Risk." Please read "More About Risk" carefully before you invest in the   
Fund.                                                                           

PERFORMANCE

RISK RETURN TABLE                                                           

This table compares the average annual total return of the Fund for the     
periods shown with that of the S&P Index and the Russell 3000(R) Index. On      
January 13, 2000, in conjunction with the change of the sub-advisor, and in the 
objective and strategies of the Fund, the Board of Directors of the Company     
approved changing the Fund's performance benchmark from the Russell 3000 Index  
to the S&P Index. The S&P Index consists of 500 stocks chosen for market        
capitalization, liquidity and industry group representation. The S&P Index is   
unmanaged and market-value-weighted, and is one of the most widely used         
benchmarks of U.S. equity performance. The Russell 3000(R) Index is a           
broad-based unmanaged market capitalization-weighted measure of the 3000        
largest U.S. publicly traded stocks. This table assumes the redemption of       
shares at the end of the period and the reinvestment of distributions and       
dividends.

As an investor, you pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the    
Fund, which are described in the table below. "Shareholder Fees" are paid from  
your account. "Annual Fund Operating Expenses" are paid out of Fund assets, so  
their effect is included in the share price. "Annual Fund Operating Expense"    
figures are for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the   
Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example, however, is

The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods
indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The   
example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that    
the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may   
be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

More About Risk
GENERALLY                                                                   

A Fund's risk profile is largely defined by the Fund's investment goal and  
principal strategies. The principal risks of investing in the Fund are          
described in the Fund description above. Before you invest, please make sure    
you understand the risks that apply to the Fund. As with any mutual fund, there 
is no guarantee that you will make money over any period of time and you could  
lose money by investing in the Fund. All investments involve some level of      
risk. Simply defined, risk is the possibility that you may lose money and not   
make money.                                                                     

Investments in the Fund are not bank deposits. They are not insured or      
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government 
agency.                                                                         

The Fund may use certain investment practices that have higher risks and    
opportunities associated with them. However, the Fund has limitations and       
policies designed to reduce these risks. To the extent the Fund utilizes these  
securities or practices, its overall performance may be affected, either        
positively or negatively.                                                       

OTHER TYPES OF INVESTMENT RISKS                                             

Correlation Risk. The risk that changes in the value of a hedging instrument
will not match those of the investment being hedged. Hedging is the use of one  
investment to offset the effects of another. Incomplete correlation can result  
in unanticipated risks.                                                         

 Credit Risk. The risk that the issuer of a security, or the counterparty to a
contract, will default or otherwise become unable to honor a financial          
obligation.                                                                     

Early Closing Risk. The risk that unanticipated early closings of securities
exchanges will result in the Fund being unable to sell or buy securities on     
that day. If an exchange closes early on a day when the Fund needs to execute a 
high volume of securities trades late in a trading day, the Fund might incur    
substantial trading losses.                                                     

Information Risk. The risk that key information about an issuer, security or
market is inaccurate or unavailable.                                            

Interest Rate Risk. The risk of a decline in an investment's market value   
attributable to changes in interest rates. With bonds and other fixed income    
securities, a rise in interest rates typically causes a fall in values, while a 
fall in interest rates typically causes a rise in values.                       

Liquidity Risk. The risk that certain securities may be difficult or        
impossible to sell at the time and the price that the seller would like. The    
seller may have to lower the price, sell other securities instead or forego an  
investment opportunity. Any of these could have a negative effect on Fund       
management or performance.                                                      

                                                                           7

Management Risk. The risk that a strategy used by the Fund may fail to      
produce the intended result. This risk is common to all mutual funds.           

Natural Event Risk. The risk of losses attributable to natural disasters and
similar events.                                                                 

Opportunity Risk. The risk of missing out on an investment opportunity      
because the assets necessary to take advantage of it are tied up in other       
investments.                                                                    

Political Risk. The risk of losses attributable to government or political  
instability, such as changes in tax or trade statutes, nationalization,         
expropriation, currency blockage or governmental collapse and war.              

Valuation Risk. The risk that the Fund has valued certain of its securities 
at a higher price that it can sell them for.                                    

8

PRICING OF SHARES                                                           

You pay no sales charges on initial or subsequent investments in the Fund.  
Your price for Fund shares is the Fund's net asset value ("NAV") per share,     
which is generally calculated at the later of the close of regular trading on   
the New York Stock Exchange (typically 4 p.m. Eastern time) or the time for     
settlement of the Funds' options and futures contracts, if any (typically 4:15  
p.m. Eastern time), each day the Exchange is open for business. Your purchase   
order will be priced at the next NAV calculated after your order is accepted by 
the Fund. Your redemption request will be priced at the next NAV calculated     
after the Fund receives the request in proper form.                             

Options and futures contracts purchased and held by the Fund are valued at  
the close of the securities or commodities exchanges on which they are traded   
(typically 4:15 p.m. Eastern time). Stock index options will be valued at the   
last price, but if that price does not fall within the bid and ask price for    
the stock index option when the market closes at 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time, then   
the stock index option will be valued at the mean between the bid and asked     
quotations. These times are referred to as "Valuation Times." The Fund values   
its securities based on market value or, where market quotations are not        
readily available or are believed not to reflect market value at Valuation      
Times, based on fair value as determined in good faith using consistently       
applied procedures established by the Fund's Board. Debt obligations that will  
mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of amortized cost, unless the 
Board determines that using this method would not reflect the investments'      
value.                                                                          

 Some Fund securities may be listed on foreign exchanges that are open on days
(such as Saturdays) when the Fund does not compute their prices. This could     
cause the value of the Fund's portfolio investments to be affected by trading   
on days when you cannot buy or sell shares.                                     

                                                                            11

BUYING SHARES                                                               

Currently, only investors who have entered into an investment management    
agreement with an Investment Professional and have a custodial relationship     
with Centurion Trust are eligible to buy shares of the Fund. Investment         
Professionals may charge fees for their services in addition to the expenses    
charged by the Fund and may set different minimum investments or limitations on 
buying or selling shares than those described below. Investors should consult   
their Investment Professionals if in doubt.                                     

Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500                                          

Minimum Subsequent Investment: $250                                         

All investments must be in U.S. dollars. Third-party checks cannot be       
accepted. You may be charged a fee for any check that does not clear. In its    
discretion, subject to review by the Board, Centurion Trust may waive the above 
minimum investment requirements.                                                

SELLING SHARES                                                              

When selling shares, your order will be processed promptly and you will     
generally receive the proceeds within a week. Before selling recently purchased 
shares, please note that if the Fund has not yet collected payment for the      
shares you are selling, it may delay sending the proceeds for up to eight       
business days.                                                                  

Some circumstances require written sell orders, along with signature        
guarantees. These include:                                                      

.amounts of $100,000 or more;                                               

.amounts of $1,000 or more on accounts whose address has been changed within
the last 30 days; or                                                      

.requests to send the proceeds to a different payee or address.             

A signature guarantee helps protect against fraud. You can obtain one from

Account Policies (continued)                                                    

Unless you decline telephone privileges on your application, you may be     
responsible for any fraudulent telephone order as long as the Fund takes        
reasonable measures to verify the order.                                        

The Fund reserves the right to:                                             

 .refuse any purchase or exchange request that could adversely affect the Fund
 or its operations, including those from any individual or group who, in the
Fund's view, is likely to engage in excessive trading;                    

.refuse any purchase or exchange request in excess of 1% of the Fund's total
assets;                                                                   

.change or discontinue its exchange privilege, or temporarily suspend this

.change its minimum investment amounts;                                     

.delay sending out redemption proceeds for up to seven days if doing so     
sooner would adversely affect the Fund (generally applies only in cases of
very large redemptions, excessive trading or during unusual market        
conditions); and                                                          

.make a "redemption in kind" (payment in portfolio securities rather than   
cash) if the amount you are redeeming is large enough to affect Fund      
operations.

TELEPHONE PRIVILEGE                                                         

To move money between your bank account and your Fund account with a phone  
call, use the telephone privilege. You can set up this privilege on your        
account by providing bank account information and following the instructions on 
your application.                                                               

ACCOUNT STATEMENTS                                                          

You will automatically receive regular account statements. You will also be 
sent a yearly statement detailing the tax characteristics of any dividends and  
distributions you have received.                                                

Distribution Policies and Taxes                                                 

DISTRIBUTIONS                                                               

As a Fund investor, you will receive distributions.                         

 The Fund earns dividends from stocks and interest from bond, money market and
other investments. These are passed along as dividend distributions. The Fund   
realizes capital gains whenever it sells securities for a higher price than it  
paid for them. These are passed along as capital gains distributions, a portion 
of which may be taxable to you as ordinary income.                              

The Fund declares and pays its net income and capital gains annually. The   
Fund's capital gains are usually distributed in November or December.           

 When you open an account, specify on your account application how you want to
receive your distributions. Most investors have their distributions reinvested  
in additional shares of the Fund. Distributions will be automatically           
reinvested unless you choose on your account application to have your           
distributions mailed to you by check or sent by electronic transfer.            

 For retirement accounts, all distributions are automatically reinvested. When
you are over 59 1/2 years old, you can receive distributions in cash.           

TAXES                                                                       

As with any investment, you should consider how your investment in the Fund 
will be taxed. Unless your account is an IRA or other tax-advantaged account,   
you should be aware of the potential tax implications. Please consult your tax  
professional concerning your own tax situation.

Distribution Policies and Taxes (continued)                                     

Taxes on Distributions. As long as the Fund continues to meet the           
requirements for being a tax-qualified regulated investment company, it pays no 
federal income tax on the earnings it distributes to shareholders.              

Consequently, distributions you receive from the Fund, whether reinvested or
taken in cash, are generally considered taxable. Distributions from the Fund's  
long-term capital gains are taxed as long-term capital gains regardless of how  
long you have held Fund shares; distributions from other sources are generally  
taxed as ordinary income.                                                       

Some dividends paid in January may be taxable as if they had been paid the  
previous December. If you buy shares shortly before or on the "record date"     
(the date that establishes you as the person to receive the upcoming            
distribution) you will receive a portion of the money you just invested in the  
form of a taxable distribution.                                                 

If you fail to provide your correct taxpayer identification number on your  
application, or you have been notified by the IRS that you are subject to       
backup withholding, the Fund may withhold 31% of all distributions to you for   
federal taxes. In the case of an individual, your taxpayer identification       
number is your social security number.                                          

The form 1099 that is mailed to you every January details your distributions
and their federal tax category, including the portion taxable as long-term      
capital gains.                                                                  

 Taxes on Transactions. Any time you sell or exchange shares, it is considered
a taxable event for you. Depending on the purchase price and the sale price of  
the shares you sell or exchange, you may have a gain or loss on the             
transaction. You are responsible for any tax liabilities generated by your      
transactions.                                                                   

Fund Details                                                                    

ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATOR                                                     

SBFM serves as the administrator for the Company and is responsible for

BENCHMARK INFORMATION                                                       

The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard & Poor's, 
which own service mark rights to the S&P Index. S&P Index does not make any     
representation or warranty, implied or express, to investors in the Fund, or

Financial Highlights                                                            

The financial highlights tables are intended to help you understand the     
perfor-mance of the Fund since inception. Certain information reflects          
financial results for a single share. Total return represents the rate that a   
shareholder would have earned (or lost) on a fund share assuming reinvestment   
of all dividends and distributions. The information in the following tables was 
audited by KPMG LLP, independent auditors, whose report, along with the Fund's  
financial statements, are included in the annual report (available upon         
request).

 This Statement of Additional Information ("SAI") is meant to be read in
conjunction with the Prospectus for Centurion Funds, Inc. (the "Company") dated 
January ___, 2002, as amended or supplemented from time to time (the            
"Prospectus"), and is incorporated by reference in its entirety into the        
Prospectus. The Company currently consists of one separately managed portfolio: 
Centurion U.S. Contra Fund (the "U.S. Contra Fund") (the "Fund,"). Because this 
SAI is not itself a prospectus, no investment in shares of the Fund should be   
made solely upon the information contained herein. Copies of the Prospectus and

 ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY

        The Company is a diversified open-end management investment company that
was organized as a corporation on August 20, 1998 under the laws of the State of
Maryland. The Company's Charter authorizes the Board of Directors (the "Board") 
to issue 500,000,000 full and fractional shares of capital stock, $.001 par     
value, of which 500,000,000 shares are designated a series called the "Centurion
U.S. Contra Fund."

 INVESTMENT GOALS AND POLICIES

    The investment goal of the U.S. Contra Fund is to provide protection
against declines in the value of the U.S. equity allocation of certain assets   
custodied with Centurion Trust Company ("Centurion"). The following information 
supplements the discussion of the Fund's investment goal and policies in the    
Prospectus. There are no assurances that the Fund will achieve its investment   
goal.                                                                           

        Centurion serves as investment manager to the Fund. Centurion has Credit
Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("CSAM") as sub-adviser to the U.S. Contra Fund.   
The term "Adviser," as used in this SAI, shall refer to Centurion and/or CSAM,  
as applicable.                                                                  

Options, Futures and Currency Exchange Transactions                             
---------------------------------------------------                             

        Securities Options. The Fund may write covered call options on stock and
------------------                                              
debt securities and may purchase U.S. exchanged-traded and over-the counter     
("OTC") put and call options.                                                   

   The Fund realizes fees (referred to as "premiums") for granting the
rights evidenced by the options it has written. A put option embodies the right 
of its purchaser to compel the writer of the option to purchase from the option 
holder an underlying security at a specified price for a specified time period  
or at a specified time. In contrast, a call option embodies the right of its    
purchaser to compel the writer of the option to sell to the option holder an    
underlying security at a specified price for a specified time period or at a    
specified time.                                                                 

    The principal reason for writing covered options on a security is to
attempt to realize, through the receipt of premiums, a greater return than would
be realized on the securities alone. In return for a premium, the Fund as the   
writer of a covered call option forfeits the right to any appreciation in the   
value of the underlying security above the strike price for the life of the     
option (or until a closing purchase transaction can be effected). Nevertheless, 
the Fund as a call writer retains the risk of a decline in the price of the     
underlying security. The size of the premiums that the Fund may receive may be  
adversely affected as new or existing institutions, including other investment  
companies, engage in or increase their option-writing activities.               

     In the case of options written by the Fund that are deemed covered by
virtue of the Fund's holding convertible or exchangeable preferred stock or debt
securities, the time required to convert or exchange and obtain physical        
delivery of the underlying common stock with respect to which the Fund has      
written options may exceed the time within which the Fund must make delivery in 
accordance with an exercise notice. In these instances, the Fund may purchase or
temporarily borrow the underlying securities for purposes of physical delivery. 
By so doing, a Fund will not bear any market risk, since the Fund will have the 
absolute right to receive from                                                  

 A-2

P-->485APOS23rd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
the issuer of the underlying security an equal number of shares to replace the  
borrowed securities, but the Fund may incur additional transaction costs or     
interest expenses in connection with any such purchase or borrowing.            

    Additional risks exist with respect to certain of the securities for
which the Fund may write covered call options. For example, if the Fund writes  
covered call options on mortgage-backed securities, the mortgage-backed         
securities that it holds as cover may, because of scheduled amortization or     
unscheduled prepayments, cease to be sufficient cover. If this occurs, the Fund 
will compensate for the decline in the value of the cover by purchasing an      
appropriate additional amount of mortgage-backed securities.                    

       Options written by the Fund will normally have expiration dates between
one and twelve months from the date written. The exercise price of the options  
may be below, equal to or above the market values of the underlying securities  
at the times the options are written. In the case of call options, these        
exercise prices are referred to as "in-the-money," "at-the-money" and           
"out-of-the-money," respectively. The Fund may write (i) in-the-money call      
options when the Adviser expects that the price of the underlying security will 
remain flat or decline moderately during the option period, (ii) at-the-money   
call options when the Adviser expects that the price of the underlying security 
will remain flat or advance moderately during the option period and (iii)       
out-of-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the premiums        
received from writing the call option plus the appreciation in market price of  
the underlying security up to the exercise price will be greater than the       
appreciation in the price of the underlying security alone. In any of the       
preceding situations, if the market price of the underlying security declines   
and the security is sold at this lower price, the amount of any realized loss   
will be offset wholly or in part by the premium received. To secure its         
obligation to deliver the underlying security when it writes a call option, the 
Fund will be required to deposit in escrow the underlying security or other     
assets in accordance with the rules of the Options Clearing Corporation (the    
"Clearing Corporation") and of the securities exchange on which the option is   
written.                                                                        

       Prior to their expirations, put and call options may be sold in closing
sale or purchase transactions (sales or purchases by the Fund prior to the      
exercise of options that it has purchased or written, respectively, of options  
of the same series) in which the Fund may realize a profit or loss from the     
sale. An option position may be closed out only where there exists a secondary  
market for an option of the same series on a recognized securities exchange or  
in the over-the-counter market. When the Fund has purchased an option and       
engages in a closing sale transaction, whether the Fund realizes a profit or    
loss will depend upon whether the amount received in the closing sale           
transaction is more or less than the premium the Fund initially paid for the    
original option plus the related transaction costs. Similarly, in cases where   
the Fund has written an option, it will realize a profit if the cost of the     
closing purchase transaction is less than the premium received upon writing the 
original option and will incur a loss if the cost of the closing purchase       
transaction exceeds the premium received upon writing the original option. The  
Fund may engage in a closing purchase transaction to realize a profit, to       
prevent an underlying security with respect to which it has written an option   
from being called or put or, in the case of a call option, to unfreeze an       
underlying security (thereby permitting its sale or the writing of a new option 
on the security prior to the outstanding option's expiration). The obligation of
the Fund under an option it has written would be terminated by a closing        
purchase transaction, but the Fund would not be deemed to own an option as a    
result of the transaction.                                                      

 A-3

P-->485APOS24th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
So long as the obligation of the Fund as the writer of an option continues, the 
Fund may be assigned an exercise notice by the broker-dealer through which the  
option was sold, requiring the Fund to deliver the underlying security against  
payment of the exercise price. This obligation terminates when the option       
expires or the Fund effects a closing purchase transaction. The Fund can no     
longer effect a closing purchase transaction with respect to an option once it  
has been assigned an exercise notice.                                           

    There is no assurance that sufficient trading interest will exist to
create a liquid secondary market on a securities exchange for any particular    
option or at any particular time, and for some options no such secondary market 
may exist. A liquid secondary market in an option may cease to exist for a      
variety of reasons. In the past, for example, higher than anticipated trading   
activity or order flow or other unforeseen events have at times rendered certain
of the facilities of the Clearing Corporation and various securities exchanges  
inadequate and resulted in the institution of special procedures, such as       
trading rotations, restrictions on certain types of orders or trading halts or  
suspensions in one or more options. There can be no assurance that similar      
events, or events that may otherwise interfere with the timely execution of     
customers' orders, will not recur. In such event, it might not be possible to   
effect closing transactions in particular options. Moreover, the Fund's ability 
to terminate options positions established in the over-the-counter market may be
more limited than for exchange-traded options and may also involve the risk that
securities dealers participating in over-the-counter transactions would fail to 
meet their obligations to the Fund. The Fund, however, intends to purchase      
over-the-counter options only from dealers whose debt securities, as determined 
by the Adviser, are considered to be investment grade. If, as a covered call    
option writer, the Fund is unable to effect a closing purchase transaction in a 
secondary market, it will not be able to sell the underlying security until the 
option expires or it delivers the underlying security upon exercise. In either  
case, the Fund would continue to be at market risk on the security and could    
face higher transaction costs, including brokerage commissions.                 

     Securities exchanges generally have established limitations governing
the maximum number of calls and puts of each class which may be held or written,
or exercised within certain time periods by an investor or group of investors   
acting in concert (regardless of whether the options are written on the same or 
different securities exchanges or are held, written or exercised in one or more 
accounts or through one or more brokers). It is possible that the Fund and other
clients of the Adviser and certain of its affiliates may be considered to be    
such a group. A securities exchange may order the liquidation of positions found
to be in violation of these limits and it may impose certain other sanctions.   
These limits may restrict the number of options the Fund will be able to        
purchase on a particular security.                                              

        Stock Index Options. The Fund may purchase and write exchange-listed and
-------------------                                             
OTC put and call options on stock indexes. A stock index measures the movement  
of a certain group of stocks by assigning relative values to the common stocks  
included in the index, fluctuating with changes in the market values of the     
stocks included in the index. Some stock index options are based on a broad     
market index, such as the NYSE Composite Index, or a narrower market index such 
as the Standard & Poor's 100. Indexes may also be based on a particular industry
or market segment.                                                              

 A-4

P-->485APOS25th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
        Options on stock indexes are similar to options on stock except that (i)
the expiration cycles of stock index options are monthly, while those of stock  
options are currently quarterly, and (ii) the delivery requirements are         
different. Instead of giving the right to take or make delivery of stock at a   
specified price, an option on a stock index gives the holder the right to       
receive a cash "exercise settlement amount" equal to (a) the amount, if any, by 
which the fixed exercise price of the option exceeds (in the case of a put) or  
is less than (in the case of a call) the closing value of the underlying index  
on the date of exercise, multiplied by (b) a fixed "index multiplier." Receipt  
of this cash amount will depend upon the closing level of the stock index upon  
which the option is based being greater than, in the case of a call, or less    
than, in the case of a put, the exercise price of the index and the exercise    
price of the option times a specified multiple. The writer of the option is     
obligated, in return for the premium received, to make delivery of this amount. 
Stock index options may be offset by entering into closing transactions as      
described above for securities options.                                         

    OTC Options. The Fund may purchase OTC or dealer options or sell OTC
-----------                                                     
options. Unlike exchange-listed options where an intermediary or clearing       
corporation, such as the Clearing Corporation, assures that all transactions in 
such options are properly executed, the responsibility for performing all       
transactions with respect to OTC options rests solely with the writer and the   
holder of those options. A listed call option writer, for example, is obligated 
to deliver the underlying stock to the clearing organization if the option is   
exercised, and the clearing organization is then obligated to pay the writer the
exercise price of the option. If the Fund were to purchase a dealer option,     
however, it would rely on the dealer from whom it purchased the option to       
perform if the option were exercised. If the dealer fails to honor the exercise 
of the option by the Fund, the Fund would lose the premium it paid for the      
option and the expected benefit of the transaction.                             

     Listed options generally have a continuous liquid market while dealer
options have none. Consequently, the Fund will generally be able to realize the 
value of a dealer option it has purchased only by exercising it or reselling it 
to the dealer who issued it. Similarly, when the Fund writes a dealer option, it
generally will be able to close out the option prior to its expiration only by  
entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer to which the Fund  
originally wrote the option. Although the Fund will seek to enter into dealer   
options only with dealers who will agree to and that are expected to be capable 
of entering into closing transactions with the Fund, there can be no assurance  
that the Fund will be able to liquidate a dealer option at a favorable price at 
any time prior to expiration. The inability to enter into a closing transaction 
may result in material losses to the Fund. Until the Fund, as a covered OTC call
option writer, is able to effect a closing purchase transaction, it will not be 
able to liquidate securities (or other assets) used to cover the written option 
until the option expires or is exercised. This requirement may impair the Fund's
ability to sell portfolio securities or, with respect to currency options,      
currencies at a time when such sale might be advantageous. In the event of      
insolvency of the other party, the Fund may be unable to liquidate a dealer     
option.                                                                         

Futures Activities. The Fund may enter into foreign currency, interest
------------------                                              
rate and stock index futures contracts and purchase and write (sell) related    
options traded on exchanges designated by the Commodity Futures Trading         
Commission (the "CFTC") or consistent with CFTC regulations on foreign          
exchanges. These transactions may be entered into for "bona fide hedging"       
purposes as defined in CFTC regulations and other permissible purposes including

 A-5

P-->485APOS26th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
hedging against changes in the value of portfolio securities due to anticipated 
changes in currency values, interest rates and/or market conditions and         
increasing return.                                                              

The Fund will not enter into futures contracts and related options for
which the aggregate initial margin and premiums (discussed below) required to   
establish positions other than those considered to be "bona fide hedging" by the
CFTC exceed 5% of the Fund's net asset value after taking into account          
unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered   
into. The Fund reserves the right to engage in transactions involving futures   
contracts and options on futures contracts to the extent allowed by CFTC        
regulations in effect from time to time and in accordance with the Fund's       
policies. There is no overall limit on the percentage of Fund assets that may be
at risk with respect to futures activities.                                     

    The over the counter market in forward foreign currency exchange contracts
offers less protection against defaults by the other party to such instruments  
than is available for currency instruments traded on an exchange. Such contracts
are subject to the risk that the counterparty to the contract will default on   
its obligations. Since these contracts are not guaranteed by an exchange or     
clearinghouse, a default on the contract would deprive the Fund of unrealized   
profits, transaction costs or the benefits of a currency hedge or force the Fund
to cover its purchase or sale commitments, if any, at the current market price. 
Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. 
They generally are determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign 
exchange markets and the relative merits of investments in different countries, 
actual or perceived changes in interest rates and other complex factors as seen 
from an international perspective. Currency exchange rates also can be affected 
unpredictably by intervention by U.S. or foreign governments or central banks,  
or the failure to intervene, or by currency controls or political developments  
in the U.S. or abroad.                                                          

 Futures Contracts. A foreign currency futures contract provides for the
future sale by one party and the purchase by the other party of a certain amount
of a specified non-U.S. currency at a specified price, date, time and place. An 
interest rate futures contract provides for the future sale by one party and the
purchase by the other party of a certain amount of a specific interest rate     
sensitive financial instrument (debt security) at a specified price, date, time 
and place. Stock indexes are capitalization weighted indexes which reflect the  
market value of the stock listed on the indexes. A stock index futures contract 
is an agreement to be settled by delivery of an amount of cash equal to a       
specified multiplier times the difference between the value of the index at the 
close of the last trading day on the contract and the price at which the        
agreement is made.                                                              

No consideration is paid or received by the Fund upon entering into a 
futures contract. Instead, the Fund is required to deposit in a segregated      
account with its custodian an amount of cash or liquid securities acceptable to 
the broker, equal to approximately 1% to 10% of the contract amount (this amount
is subject to change by the exchange on which the contract is traded, and       
brokers may charge a higher amount). This amount is known as "initial margin"   
and is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the contract
which is returned to the Fund upon termination of the futures contract, assuming
all contractual obligations have been satisfied. The broker will have access to 
amounts in the margin account if the Fund fails to meet its contractual         
obligations. Subsequent payments, known as "variation margin," to and from the  
broker, will be made daily as the currency, financial instrument or stock index 
underlying the                                                                  

 A-6

P-->485APOS27th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
futures contract fluctuates, making the long and short positions in the futures 
contract more or less valuable, a process known as "marking-to-market." The Fund
will also incur brokerage costs in connection with entering into futures        
transactions.                                                                   

 At any time prior to the expiration of a futures contract, the Fund may
elect to close the position by taking an opposite position, which will operate  
to terminate the Fund's existing position in the contract. Positions in futures 
contracts and options on futures contracts (described below) may be closed out  
only on the exchange on which they were entered into (or through a linked       
exchange). No secondary market for such contracts exists. Although the Fund     
intends to enter into futures contracts only if there is an active market for   
such contracts, there is no assurance that an active market will exist at any   
particular time. Most futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation         
permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily
limit has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made that day 
at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods  
during the day. It is possible that futures contract prices could move to the   
daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading,     
thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions at an advantageous   
price and subjecting the Fund to substantial losses. In such event, and in the  
event of adverse price movements, the Fund would be required to make daily cash 
payments of variation margin. In such situations, if the Fund had insufficient  
cash, it might have to sell securities to meet daily variation margin           
requirements at a time when it would be disadvantageous to do so. In addition,  
if the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes, in such circumstances  
the Fund may realize a loss on a futures contract or option that is not offset  
by an increase in the value of the hedged position. Losses incurred in futures  
transactions and the costs of these transactions will affect the Fund's         
performance.                                                                    

    Options on Futures Contracts. The Fund may purchase and write put and call
options on foreign currency, interest rate and stock index futures contracts and
may enter into closing transactions with respect to such options to terminate   
existing positions. There is no guarantee that such closing transactions can be 
effected; the ability to establish and close out positions on such options will 
be subject to the existence of a liquid market.                                 

    An option on a currency, interest rate or stock index futures contract, as
contrasted with the direct investment in such a contract, gives the purchaser   
the right, in return for the premium paid, to assume a position in a futures    
contract at a specified exercise price at any time prior to the expiration date 
of the option. The writer of the option is required upon exercise to assume an  
offsetting futures position (a short position if the option is a call and a long
position if the option is a put). Upon exercise of an option, the delivery of   
the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option    
will be accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writer's      
futures margin account, which represents the amount by which the market price of
the futures contract exceeds, in the case of a call, or is less than, in the    
case of a put, the exercise price of the option on the futures contract. The    
potential loss related to the purchase of an option on futures contracts is     
limited to the premium paid for the option (plus transaction costs). Because the
value of the option is fixed at the point of sale, there are no daily cash      
payments by the purchaser to reflect changes in the value of the underlying     
contract; however, the value of the option does change daily and that change    
would be reflected in the net asset value of the Fund.

 Currency Exchange Transactions. The value in U.S. dollars of the assets of
------------------------------                                        
the Fund that are invested in foreign securities may be affected favorably or   
unfavorably by changes in exchange control regulations, and the Fund may incur  
costs in connection with conversion between various currencies. Currency        
exchange transactions may be from any non-U.S. currency into U.S. dollars or    
into other appropriate currencies. The Fund will conduct its currency exchange  
transactions (i) on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the rate prevailing in the     
currency exchange market, (ii) through entering into futures contracts or       
options on such contracts (as described above), (iii) through entering into     
forward contracts to purchase or sell currency or (iv) by purchasing            
exchange-traded currency options.                                               

Forward Currency Contracts. A forward currency contract involves an   
obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date, which may  
be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract as agreed upon by the 
parties, at a price set at the time of the contract. These contracts are entered
into in the interbank market conducted directly between currency traders        
(usually large commercial banks and brokers) and their customers. Forward       
currency contracts are similar to currency futures contracts, except that       
futures contracts are traded on commodities exchanges and are standardized as to
contract size and delivery date.                                                

     At or before the maturity of a forward contract, the Fund may either sell a
portfolio security and make delivery of the currency, or retain the security and
fully or partially offset its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by 
negotiating with its trading partner to purchase a second, offsetting contract. 
If the Fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting         
transaction, the Fund, at the time of execution of the offsetting transaction,  
will incur a gain or a loss to the extent that movement has occurred in forward 
contract prices.                                                                

Currency Options. The Fund may purchase exchange-traded put and call  
options on foreign currencies. Put options convey the right to sell the         
underlying currency at a price which is anticipated to be higher than the spot  
price of the currency at the time the option is exercised. Call options convey  
the right to buy the underlying currency at a price which is expected to be     
lower than the spot price of the currency at the time the option is exercised.  

  Currency Hedging. The Fund's currency hedging will be limited to hedging
involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions in the aggregate. 
Transaction hedging is the purchase or sale of forward currency with respect to 
specific receivables or payables of the Fund generally accruing in connection   
with the purchase or sale of its portfolio securities. Position hedging is the  
sale of forward currency with respect to portfolio security positions. The Fund 
may not position hedge to an extent greater than the aggregate market value (at 
the time of entering into the hedge) of the hedged securities.                  

A decline in the U.S. dollar value of a foreign currency in which the 
Fund's securities are denominated will reduce the U.S. dollar value of the      
securities, even if their value in the foreign currency remains constant. The   
use of currency hedges does not eliminate fluctuations in the underlying prices 
of the securities, but it does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved
in the future. For example, in order to protect against diminutions in the U.S. 
dollar value of securities it holds the Fund may purchase currency put options. 
If the value of the currency does decline, the Fund will have the right to sell 
the currency for a fixed amount in dollars and will thereby offset, in whole or 
in part, the adverse effect on the U.S. dollar value of its securities that     

 A-8

P-->485APOS29th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
otherwise would have resulted. Conversely, if a rise in the U.S. dollar value of
a currency in which securities to be acquired are denominated is projected,     
thereby potentially increasing the cost of the securities, the Fund may purchase
call options on the particular currency. The purchase of these options could    
offset, at least partially, the effects of the adverse movements in exchange    
rates. The benefit to the Fund derived from purchases of currency options, like 
the benefit derived from other types of options, will be reduced by premiums and
other transaction costs. Because transactions in currency exchange are generally
conducted on a principal basis, no fees or commissions are generally involved.  
Currency hedging involves some of the same risks and considerations as other    
transactions with similar instruments. Although currency hedges limit the risk  
of loss due to a decline in the value of a hedged currency, at the same time,   
they also limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the    
currency increase. If a devaluation is generally anticipated, the Fund may not  
be able to contract to sell a currency at a price above the devaluation level it
anticipates.                                                                    

While the values of currency futures and options on futures, forward  
currency contracts and currency options may be expected to correlate with       
exchange rates, they will not reflect other factors that may affect the value of
the Fund's investments and a currency hedge may not be entirely successful in   
mitigating changes in the value of the Fund's investments denominated in that   
currency. A currency hedge, for example, should protect a Yen-denominated bond  
against a decline in the Yen, but will not protect the Fund against a price     
decline if the issuer's creditworthiness deteriorates.                          

  Swaps. The Fund may enter into swaps relating to indexes, currencies and
-----                                                                 
equity interests of foreign issuers. A swap transaction is an agreement between 
the Fund and a counterparty to act in accordance with the terms of the swap     
contract. Index swaps involve the exchange by the Fund with another party of the
respective amounts payable with respect to a notional principal amount related  
to one or more indexes. Currency swaps involve the exchange of cash flows on a  
notional amount of two or more currencies based on their relative future values.
An equity swap is an agreement to exchange streams of payments computed by      
reference to a notional amount based on the performance of a basket of stocks or
a single stock. The Fund may enter into these transactions to preserve a return 
or spread on a particular investment or portion of its assets, to protect       
against currency fluctuations, as a duration management technique or to protect 
against any increase in the price of securities the Fund anticipates purchasing 
at a later date. The Fund may also use these transactions for speculative       
purposes, such as to obtain the price performance of a security without actually
purchasing the security in circumstances, for example, the subject security is  
illiquid, is unavailable for direct investment or available only on less        
attractive terms. Swaps have risks associated with them including possible      
default by the counterparty to the transaction, illiquidity and, where swaps are
used as hedges, the risk that the use of a swap could result in losses greater  
than if the swap had not been employed                                          

The Fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis (i.e., the two  
payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment date or dates
specified in the agreement, with the Fund receiving or paying, as the case may  
be, only the net amount of the two payments). Swaps do not involve the delivery 
of securities, other underlying assets or principal. Accordingly, the risk of   
loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of payments that the    
Fund is contractually obligated to make. If the counterparty to a swap defaults,
the Fund's risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the Fund is 
contractually entitled to receive. Where                                        

 A-9

P-->485APOS30th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
swaps are entered into for good faith hedging purposes, the Adviser believes    
such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the Investment       
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and, accordingly, will not    
treat them as being subject to the Fund's borrowing restrictions. Where swaps   
are entered into for other than hedging purposes, the Fund will segregate an    
amount of cash or liquid securities having a value equal to the accrued excess  
of its obligations over entitlements with respect to each swap on a daily basis.

Hedging. In addition to entering into options, futures and currency   
-------                                                               
exchange transactions for other purposes, including generating current income to
offset expenses or increase return, a Fund may enter into these transactions as 
hedges to reduce investment risk, generally by making an investment expected to 
move in the opposite direction of a portfolio position. A hedge is designed to  
offset a loss in a portfolio position with a gain in the hedged position; at the
same time, however, a properly correlated hedge will result in a gain in the    
portfolio position being offset by a loss in the hedged position. As a result,  
the use of options, futures, contracts and currency exchange transactions for   
hedging purposes could limit any potential gain from an increase in the value of
the position hedged. In addition, the movement in the portfolio position hedged 
may not be of the same magnitude as movement in the hedge. With respect to      
futures contracts, since the value of portfolio securities will far exceed the  
value of the futures contracts sold by the Fund, an increase in the value of the
futures contracts could only mitigate, but not totally offset, the decline in   
the value of the Fund's assets.                                                 

    In hedging transactions based on an index, whether the Fund will realize a
gain or loss from the purchase or writing of options on an index depends upon   
movements in the level of stock prices in the stock market generally or, in the 
case of certain indexes, in an industry or market segment, rather than movements
in the price of a particular stock. The risk of imperfect correlation increases 
as the composition of the Fund's portfolio varies from the composition of the   
index. In an effort to compensate for imperfect correlation of relative         
movements in the hedged position and the hedge, the Fund's hedge positions may  
be in a greater or lesser dollar amount than the dollar amount of the hedged    
position. Such "over hedging" or "under hedging" may adversely affect the Fund's
net investment results if market movements are not as anticipated when the hedge
is established. Stock index futures transactions may be subject to additional   
correlation risks. First, all participants in the futures market are subject to 
margin deposit and maintenance requirements. Rather than meeting additional     
margin deposit requirements, investors may close futures contracts through      
offsetting transactions which would distort the normal relationship between the 
stock index and futures markets. Secondly, from the point of view of            
speculators, the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous    
than margin requirements in the securities market. Therefore, increased         
participation by speculators in the futures market also may cause temporary     
price distortions. Because of the possibility of price distortions in the       
futures market and the imperfect correlation between movements in the stock     
index and movements in the price of stock index futures, a correct forecast of  
general market trends by the Adviser still may not result in a successful       
hedging transaction.                                                            

    The Fund will engage in hedging transactions only when deemed advisable by
the Adviser, and successful use by the Fund of hedging transactions will be     
subject to the Adviser's ability to predict trends in currency, interest rate or
securities markets, as the case may be, and to correctly predict movements in   
the directions of the hedge and the hedged position and the correlation between 
them, which predictions could prove to be inaccurate. This requires             

A-10

P-->485APOS31st�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the price of         
individual securities, and there can be no assurance that the use of these      
strategies will be successful. Even a well-conceived hedge may be unsuccessful  
to some degree because of unexpected market behavior or trends. Losses incurred 
in hedging transactions and the costs of these transactions will affect the     
Fund's performance.                                                             

Asset Coverage for Forward Contracts, Options, Futures and Options on 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Futures. The Fund will comply with guidelines established by the U.S. Securities
-------                                                                         
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") with respect to coverage of forward currency
contracts; options written by the Fund on securities and indexes; and currency, 
interest rate and index futures contracts and options on these futures          
contracts. These guidelines may, in certain instances, require segregation by   
the Fund of cash or liquid securities.                                          

  For example, a call option written by the Fund on securities may require
the Fund to hold the securities subject to the call (or securities convertible  
into the securities without additional consideration) or to segregate assets (as
described above) sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call  
is exercised. A call option written by the Fund on an index may require the Fund
to own portfolio securities that correlate with the index or to segregate assets
(as described above) equal to the excess of the index value over the exercise   
price on a current basis. The Fund could purchase a put option if the strike    
price of that option is the same or higher than the strike price of a put option
sold by the Fund. If the Fund holds a futures or forward contract, the Fund     
could purchase a put option on the same futures or forward contract with a      
strike price as high or higher than the price of the contract held. The Fund may
enter into fully or partially offsetting transactions so that its net position, 
coupled with any segregated assets (equal to any remaining obligation), equals  
its net obligation. Asset coverage may be achieved by other means when          
consistent with applicable regulatory policies.                                 

Additional Information on Other Investment Practices                  
----------------------------------------------------                  

   Foreign Investments. Investors should recognize that investing in foreign
-------------------                                                   
companies involves certain risks, including those discussed below, which are not
typically associated with investing in U.S. issuers.                            

Foreign Currency Exchange. Since the Fund may invest in securities    
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and since the Fund may    
temporarily hold funds in bank deposits or other money market investments       
denominated in foreign currencies, the Fund may be affected favorably or        
unfavorably by exchange control regulations or changes in the exchange rate     
between such currencies and the dollar. A change in the value of a foreign      
currency relative to the U.S. dollar will result in a corresponding change in   
the dollar value of Fund assets denominated in that foreign currency. Changes in
foreign currency exchange rates may also affect the value of dividends and      
interest earned, gains and losses realized on the sale of securities and net    
investment income and gains, if any, to be distributed to shareholders by the   
Fund. The rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and other currencies is      
determined by the forces of supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets.  
Changes in the exchange rate may result over time from the interaction of many  
factors directly or indirectly affecting economic and political conditions in   
the United States and a particular foreign country, including economic and      
political developments in other countries. Of particular importance are rates of

A-11

P-->485APOS32nd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
inflation, interest rate levels, the balance of payments and the extent of      
government surpluses or deficits in the United States and the particular foreign
country, all of which are in turn sensitive to the monetary, fiscal and trade   
policies pursued by the governments of the United States and foreign countries  
important to international trade and finance. Governmental intervention may also
play a significant role. National governments rarely voluntarily allow their    
currencies to float freely in response to economic forces. Sovereign governments
use a variety of techniques, such as intervention by a country's central bank or
imposition of regulatory controls or taxes, to affect the exchange rates of     
their currencies. The Fund may use hedging techniques with the objective of     
protecting against loss through the fluctuation of the value of the yen against 
the U.S. dollar, particularly the forward market in foreign exchange, currency  
options and currency futures. See "Currency Exchange Transactions" and "Futures
Activities" above.                                                              

     Information. There may be less publicly available information about foreign
securities and about the foreign company or government issuing them than is     
available about a domestic company or government entity. Foreign companies are  
generally not subject to uniform financial reporting standards, practices and   
requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies.                  

     Political Instability. With respect to some foreign countries, there is the
possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation, limitations on the       
removal of funds or other assets of a Fund, political or social instability, or 
domestic developments which could affect U.S. investments in those and          
neighboring countries.                                                          

Delays. Securities of some foreign companies are less liquid and their
prices are more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. companies. Certain  
foreign countries are known to experience long delays between the trade and     
settlement dates of securities purchased or sold.                               

 Foreign Debt Securities. The returns on foreign debt securities reflect
interest rates and other market conditions prevailing in those countries and the
effect of gains and losses in the denominated currencies against the U.S.       
dollar, which have had a substantial impact on investment in foreign            
fixed-income securities. The relative performance of various countries'         
fixed-income markets historically has reflected wide variations relating to the 
unique characteristics of each country's economy. Year-to-year fluctuations in  
certain markets have been significant, and negative returns have been           
experienced in various markets from time to time.                               

  The foreign government securities in which the Fund may invest generally
consist of obligations issued or backed by national, state or provincial        
governments or similar political subdivisions or central banks in foreign       
countries. Foreign government securities also include debt obligations of       
supranational entities, which include international organizations designated or 
backed by governmental entities to promote economic reconstruction or           
development, international banking institutions and related government agencies.
Examples include the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development      
("World Bank"), the European Coal and Steel Community, the Asian Development    
Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank.                                    

Foreign government securities also include debt securities of         
"quasi-governmental agencies" and debt securities denominated in multinational  
currency units of an issuer (including                                          

A-12

P-->485APOS33rd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
supranational issuers). Debt securities of quasi-governmental agencies are      
issued by entities owned by either a national, state or equivalent government or
are obligations of a political unit that is not backed by the national          
government's full faith and credit and general taxing powers.                   

   General. Individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably
from the U.S. economy in such respects as growth of gross national product, rate
of inflation, capital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency, and balance of   
payments positions. The Fund may invest in securities of foreign governments (or
agencies or instrumentalities thereof), and many, if not all, of the foregoing  
considerations apply to such investments as well.                               

Depositary Receipts. The assets of the Fund may be invested in the    
-------------------                                                   
securities of foreign issuers in the form of American Depositary Receipts       
("ADRs"), European Depositary Receipts ("EDRs") and International Depositary    
Receipts ("IDRs"). These securities may not necessarily be denominated in the   
same currency as the securities into which they may be converted. ADRs are      
receipts typically issued by a U.S. bank or trust company which evidence        
ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation. EDRs, which 
are sometimes referred to as Continental Depositary Receipts, are receipts      
issued in Europe, and IDRs, which are sometimes referred to as Global Depositary
Receipts, are issued outside the United States. EDRs and IDRs are typically     
issued by non-U.S. banks and trust companies and evidence ownership of either   
foreign or domestic securities. Generally, ADRs in registered form are designed 
for use in U.S. securities markets and EDRs and IDRs in bearer form are designed
for use in European and non-U.S. securities markets, respectively.              

U.S. Government Securities. The Fund may invest in debt obligations of
--------------------------                                            
varying maturities issued or guaranteed by the United States government, its    
agencies or instrumentalities ("U.S. Government Securities"). Direct obligations
of the U.S. Treasury include a variety of securities that differ in their       
interest rates, maturities and dates of issuance. U.S. Government Securities    
also include securities issued or guaranteed by the Federal Housing             
Administration, Farmers Home Loan Administration, Export-Import Bank of the     
United States, Small Business Administration, Government National Mortgage      
Association ("GNMA"), General Services Administration, Central Bank for         
Cooperatives, Federal Farm Credit Banks, Federal Home Loan Banks, Federal Home  
Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"), Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, Federal 
Land Banks, Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), Maritime            
Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, District of Columbia Armory Board   
and Student Loan Marketing Association. The Fund may also invest in instruments 
that are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the U.S. Treasury  
and instruments that are supported by the credit of the instrumentality. Because
the U.S. government is not obligated by law to provide support to an            
instrumentality it sponsors, the Fund will invest in obligations issued by such 
an instrumentality only if the Adviser determines that the credit risk with     
respect to the instrumentality does not make its securities unsuitable for      
investment by the Fund.

grade securities and unrated securities of comparable quality tend to react less
to fluctuations in interest rate levels than do those of investment grade       
securities and the market values of certain of these securities also tend to be 
more sensitive to individual corporate developments and changes in economic     
conditions than below investment grade securities. In addition, these securities
generally present a higher degree of credit risk. Issuers of these securities   
are often highly                                                                

A-13

P-->485APOS34th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
leveraged and may not have more traditional methods of financing available to   
them so that their ability to service their obligations during an economic      
downturn or during sustained periods of rising interest rates may be impaired.  
The risk of loss due to default by such issuers is significantly greater because
below investment grade securities generally are unsecured and frequently are    
subordinated to prior payment of senior indebtedness.                           

The Fund may have difficulty disposing of certain of these securities 
because there may be a thin trading market. Because there is no established     
retail secondary market for many of these securities, the Fund anticipates that 
these securities could be sold only to a limited number of dealers or           
institutional investors. To the extent a secondary trading market for these     
securities does exist, it generally is not as liquid as the secondary market for
investment grade securities. The lack of a liquid secondary market, as well as  
adverse publicity and investor perception with respect to these securities, may 
have an adverse impact on market price and the Fund's ability to dispose of     
particular issues when necessary to meet liquidity needs or in response to a    
specific economic event such as a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the  
issuer. The lack of a liquid secondary market for certain securities also may   
make it more difficult for the Fund to obtain accurate market quotations for    
purposes of valuing the Fund and calculating net asset value.                   

The market value of securities rated below investment grade is more   
volatile than that of investment grade securities. Factors adversely impacting  
the market value of these securities will adversely impact the Fund's net asset 
value. The Fund will rely on the judgment, analysis and experience of the       
Adviser in evaluating the creditworthiness of an issuer. In this evaluation, the
Adviser will take into consideration, among other things, the issuer's financial
resources, its sensitivity to economic conditions and trends, its operating     
history, the quality of the issuer's management and regulatory matters.         
Normally, below investment grade securities and comparable unrated securities   
are not intended for short-term investment. The Fund may incur additional       
expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the    
payment of principal or interest on its portfolio holdings of such securities.  

     Securities of Other Investment Companies. The Fund may invest in securities
----------------------------------------                              
of other investment companies to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act.       
Presently, under the 1940 Act, the Fund may hold securities of another          
investment company in amounts which (i) do not exceed 3% of the total           
outstanding voting stock of such company, (ii) do not exceed 5% of the value of 
the Fund's total assets and (iii) when added to all other investment company    
securities held by the Fund, do not exceed 10% of the value of the Fund's total 
assets.                                                                         

DIAMONDS, SPDRs and WEBS ("Equity Equivalents"). DIAMONDS ("Dow Jones 
-----------------------------------------------                       
Industrial Average Model New Depositary Shares") and SPDRs ("Standard & Poor's  
Depositary Receipts") are exchange-traded securities that represent ownership in
long-term unit investment trusts established to accumulate and hold a portfolio 
of common stocks that is intended to track the price performance and dividend   
yield of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's Composite   
Stock Price Index, respectively. WEBS ("World Equity Benchmark Shares") are     
exchange-traded shares of series of an investment company that are designed to  
replicate the performance of a particular foreign equity market index.          

     Equity Equivalents may be used for several purposes, including, to simulate
full investment in the underlying index while retaining a cash balance for fund 
management                                                                      

A-14

P-->485APOS35th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
purposes, to facilitate trading, to reduce transaction costs or to seek higher  
investment returns where an Equity Equivalent is priced more attractively than  
securities in the underlying index. Because the expense associated with an      
investment in Equity Equivalents may be substantially lower than the expense of 
small investments directly in the securities comprising the indices they seek to
track, investments in Equity Equivalents may provide a cost-effective means of  
diversifying the Fund's assets across a broad range of equity securities.       

   To the extent a Fund invests in securities of other investment companies,
Fund shareholders would indirectly pay a portion of the operating costs of such 
companies in addition to the expenses of its own operation. These costs include 
management, brokerage, shareholder servicing and other operational expenses.    
Indirectly, then, shareholders of a Fund that invests in Equity Equivalents may 
pay higher operational costs than if they owned the underlying investment       
companies directly. Additionally, the Fund's investments in such investment     
companies are subject to limitations under the 1940 Act and market availability.

    The prices of Equity Equivalents are derived and based upon the securities
held by the particular investment company. Accordingly, the level of risk       
involved in the purchase or sale of an Equity Equivalent is similar to the risk 
involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common stock, with the exception
that the pricing mechanism for such instruments is based on a basket of stocks. 
The market prices of Equity Equivalents are expected to fluctuate in accordance 
with both changes in the net asset values of their underlying indices and the   
supply and demand for the instruments on the exchanges on which they are traded.
Substantial market or other disruptions affecting an Equity Equivalent could    
adversely affect the liquidity and value of the shares of the Fund investing in 
such instruments.                                                               

    Lending of Portfolio Securities. The Fund may lend portfolio securities to
-------------------------------                                       
brokers, dealers and other financial organizations that meet capital and other  
credit requirements or other criteria established by the Board. These loans, if 
and when made, may not exceed 33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets taken at value.
The Fund will not lend portfolio securities to affiliates of the Adviser unless 
they have applied for and received specific authority to do so from the SEC.    
Loans of portfolio securities will be collateralized by cash, letters of credit 
or U.S. Government Securities, which are maintained at all times in an amount   
equal to at least 102% of the current market value of the loaned securities. Any
gain or loss in the market price of the securities loaned that might occur      
during the term of the loan would be for the account of the Fund. From time to  
time, the Fund may return a part of the interest earned from the investment of  
collateral received for securities loaned to the borrower and/or a third party  
that is unaffiliated with the Fund and that is acting as a "finder."            

   By lending its securities, the Fund can increase its income by continuing
to receive interest and any dividends on the loaned securities as well as by    
either investing the collateral received for securities loaned in short-term    
instruments or obtaining yield in the form of interest paid by the borrower when
U.S. Government Securities are used as collateral. Although the generation of   
income is not the primary investment goal of the Funds, income received could be
used to pay the Fund's expenses and would increase an investor's total return.  
The Fund will adhere to the following conditions whenever its portfolio         
securities are loaned: (i) the Fund must receive at least 102% cash collateral  
or equivalent securities of the type discussed in the preceding paragraph from  
the borrower; (ii) the borrower must increase such collateral whenever          

A-15

P-->485APOS36th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
the market value of the securities rises above the level of such collateral;    
(iii) the Fund must be able to terminate the loan at any time; (iv) the Fund    
must receive reasonable interest on the loan, as well as any dividends, interest
or other distributions on the loaned securities and any increase in market      
value; (v) the Fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in connection with   
the loan; and (vi) voting rights on the loaned securities may pass to the       
borrower, provided, however, that if a material event adversely affecting the   
investment occurs, the Board must terminate the loan and regain the right to    
vote the securities. Loan agreements involve certain risks in the event of      
default or insolvency of the other party including possible delays or           
restrictions upon the Fund's ability to recover the loaned securities or dispose
of the collateral for the loan.                                                 

When-Issued Securities, Delayed-Delivery Transactions and Forward     
-----------------------------------------------------------------     
Commitments. The Fund may purchase securities on a "when-issued" basis, for     
-----------                                                                     
delayed delivery (i.e., payment or delivery occur beyond the normal settlement  
date at a stated price and yield) or on a forward commitment basis. The Fund    
does not intend to engage in these transactions for speculative purposes, but   
only in furtherance of its investment goal. These transactions occur when       
securities are purchased or sold by the Fund with payment and delivery taking   
place in the future to secure what is considered an advantageous yield and price
to the Fund at the time of entering into the transaction. The payment obligation
and the interest rate that will be received on when-issued securities are fixed 
at the time the buyer enters into the commitment. Due to fluctuations in the    
value of securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery basis  
or forward commitment basis, the prices obtained on such securities may be      
higher or lower than the prices available in the market on the dates when the   
investments are actually delivered to the buyers.                               

   When the Fund agrees to purchase when-issued, delayed-delivery securities
or securities on a forward commitment basis, its custodian will set aside cash  
or liquid securities equal to the amount of the commitment in a segregated      
account. Normally, the custodian will set aside portfolio securities to satisfy 
a purchase commitment, and in such a case the Fund may be required subsequently 
to place additional assets in the segregated account in order to ensure that the
value of the account remains equal to the amount of the Fund's commitment. The  
assets contained in the segregated account will be marked-to-market daily. It   
may be expected that the Fund's net assets will fluctuate to a greater degree   
when it sets aside portfolio securities to cover such purchase commitments than 
when it sets aside cash. When the Fund engages in when-issued, delayed-delivery 
or forward commitment transactions, it relies on the other party to consummate  
the trade. Failure of the seller to do so may result in the Fund's incurring a  
loss or missing an opportunity to obtain a price considered being advantageous. 

Repurchase Agreements. The Fund may agree to purchase securities from a
---------------------                                                 
bank or recognized securities dealer and simultaneously commit to resell the    
securities to the bank or dealer at an agreed-upon date and price reflecting a  
market rate of interest unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the         
purchased securities ("repurchase agreements"). The Fund would maintain custody 
of the underlying securities prior to their repurchase; thus, the obligation of 
the bank or dealer to pay the repurchase price on the date agreed to would be,  
in effect, secured by such securities. If the value of such securities were less
than the repurchase price, plus interest, the other party to the agreement would
be required to provide additional collateral so that at all times the collateral
is at least 102% of the repurchase price plus accrued interest. Default by or   
bankruptcy of a seller would expose the Fund to possible loss because of adverse
market action, expenses and/or delays in connection with the disposition of the 
underlying obligations. The                                                     

A-16

P-->485APOS37th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
financial institutions with which the Fund may enter into repurchase agreements 
will be banks and non-bank dealers of U.S. Government securities that are listed
on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's list of reporting dealers, if such    
banks and non-bank dealers are deemed creditworthy by the Fund's Adviser. The   
Adviser will continue to monitor creditworthiness of the seller under a         
repurchase agreement, and will require the seller to maintain during the term of
the agreement the value of the securities subject to the agreement to equal at  
least 102% of the repurchase price (including accrued interest). In addition,   
the Adviser will require that the value of this collateral, after transaction   
costs (including loss of interest) reasonably expected to be incurred on a      
default, be equal to 102% or greater than the repurchase price (including       
accrued premium) provided in the repurchase agreement or the daily amortization 
of the difference between the purchase price and the repurchase price specified 
in the repurchase agreement. The Adviser will mark-to-market daily the value of 
the securities. Repurchase agreements are considered to be loans by the Fund    
under the 1940 Act.                                                             

 Reverse Repurchase Agreements and Dollar Rolls. The Fund may enter into
----------------------------------------------                        
reverse repurchase agreements with the same parties with whom it may enter into 
repurchase agreements. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of        
securities held by the Fund pursuant to its agreement to repurchase them at a   
mutually agreed upon date, price and rate of interest. At the time the Fund     
enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will establish and maintain a    
segregated account with an approved custodian containing cash or liquid         
securities having a value not less than the repurchase price (including accrued 
interest). The assets contained in the segregated account will be               
marked-to-market daily and additional assets will be placed in such account on  
any day in which the assets fall below the repurchase price (plus accrued       
interest). The Fund's liquidity and ability to manage its assets might be       
affected when it sets aside cash or portfolio securities to cover such          
commitments. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risk that the market     
value of the securities retained in lieu of sale may decline below the price of 
the securities the Fund has sold but is obligated to repurchase. In the event   
the buyer of securities under a reverse repurchase agreement files for          
bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, such buyer or its trustee or receiver may      
receive an extension of time to determine whether to enforce the Fund's         
obligation to repurchase the securities, and the Fund's use of the proceeds of  
the reverse repurchase agreement may effectively be restricted pending such     
decision.                                                                       

The Fund also may enter into "dollar rolls," in which the Fund sells  
fixed-income securities for delivery in the current month and simultaneously    
contracts to repurchase similar but not identical (same type, coupon and        
maturity) securities on a specified future date. During the roll period, the    
Fund would forego principal and interest paid on such securities. The Fund would
be compensated by the difference between the current sales price and the forward
price for the future purchase, as well as by the interest earned on the cash    
proceeds of the initial sale. At the time the Fund enters into a dollar roll    
transaction, it will place in a segregated account maintained with an approved  
custodian cash or liquid securities having a value not less than the repurchase 
price (including accrued interest) and will subsequently monitor the account to 
ensure that its value is maintained. Reverse repurchase agreements and dollar   
rolls that are accounted for as financings are considered to be borrowings under
the 1940 Act.                                                                   

Convertible Securities. Convertible securities in which the Fund may  
----------------------                                                
invest, including both convertible debt and convertible preferred stock, may be 
converted at either a stated price or                                           

A-17

P-->485APOS38th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
stated rate into underlying shares of common stock. Because of this feature,    
convertible securities enable an investor to benefit from increases in the      
market price of the underlying common stock. Convertible securities provide     
higher yields than the underlying equity securities, but generally offer lower  
yields than non-convertible securities of similar quality. Like bonds, the value
of convertible securities fluctuates in relation to changes in interest rates   
and, in addition, also fluctuates in relation to the underlying common stock.   

Structured Notes. The Fund may invest in structured notes. The        
----------------                                                      
distinguishing feature of a structured note is that the amount of interest      
and/or principal payable on the notes is based on the performance of a benchmark
asset or market other than fixed-income securities or interest rates. Examples  
of a benchmark include stock prices, currency exchange rates and physical       
commodity prices. Investing in a structured note allows the Fund to gain        
exposure to the benchmark asset or market, such as investments in certain       
emerging markets that restrict investment by foreigners. The structured note    
fixes the maximum loss that the Fund may experience in the event that the market
does not perform as expected. The performance tie can be a straight relationship
or leveraged, although the Adviser generally will not use leverage in its       
structured note strategies. Depending on the terms of the note, the Fund may    
forego all or part of the interest and principal that would be payable on a     
comparable conventional note; the Fund's loss cannot exceed this foregone       
interest and/or principal. An investment in a structured note involves risks    
similar to those associated with a direct investment in the benchmark asset.    
Structured notes will be treated as illiquid securities for investment          
limitation purposes.                                                            

   Non-Publicly Traded and Illiquid Securities. The Fund may not invest more
-------------------------------------------                           
than 15% of its net assets in non-publicly traded and illiquid securities,      
including securities that are illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily    
available market, repurchase agreements which have a maturity of longer than    
seven days, certain Rule 144A Securities (as described below) and time deposits 
maturing in more than seven days. Securities that have legal or contractual     
restrictions on resale but have a readily available market are not considered   
illiquid for purposes of this limitation. Repurchase agreements subject to      
demand are deemed to have a maturity equal to the notice period.                

   Under current guidelines of the staff of the SEC, illiquid securities are
considered to include, among other securities, purchased OTC options, certain   
cover for OTC options, securities subject to contractual or legal restrictions  
on resale because they have not been registered under the Securities Act of     
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), securities which are otherwise not     
readily marketable and repurchase agreements having a maturity of longer than   
seven days. Securities which have not been registered under the Securities Act  
are referred to as private placements or restricted securities and are purchased
directly from the issuer or in the secondary market. Limitations on resale may  
have an adverse effect on the marketability of portfolio securities and a mutual
fund might be unable to dispose of restricted or other illiquid securities      
promptly or at reasonable prices and might thereby experience difficulty        
satisfying redemptions within seven days without borrowing. A mutual fund might 
also have to register such restricted securities in order to dispose of them    
resulting in additional expense and delay. Adverse market conditions could      
impede such a public offering of securities.                                    

  In recent years, however, a large institutional market has developed for
certain securities that are not registered under the Securities Act including   
repurchase agreements, commercial                                               

A-18

P-->485APOS39th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
paper, foreign securities, municipal securities and corporate bonds and notes.  
Institutional investors depend on an efficient institutional market in which the
unregistered security can be readily resold or on an issuer's ability to honor a
demand for repayment. The fact that there are contractual or legal restrictions 
on resale to the general public or to certain institutions may not be indicative
of the liquidity of such investments.                                           

     Rule 144A Securities. Rule 144A under the Securities Act adopted by the SEC
allows for a broader institutional trading market for securities otherwise      
subject to restriction on resale to the general public. Rule 144A establishes a 
"safe harbor" from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for      
resales of certain securities to qualified institutional buyers. The Adviser    
anticipates that the market for certain restricted securities such as           
institutional commercial paper will expand further as a result of this          
regulation and use of automated systems for the trading, clearance and          
settlement of unregistered securities of domestic and foreign issuers, such as  
the PORTAL System sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers,  
Inc.                                                                            

An investment in Rule 144A Securities will be considered illiquid and 
therefore subject to the Fund's limit on the purchase of illiquid securities    
unless the Board or its delegates determines that the Rule 144A Securities are  
liquid. In reaching liquidity decisions, the Board and its delegates may        
consider, inter alia, the following factors: (i) the unregistered nature of the 
security; (ii) the frequency of trades and quotes for the security; (iii) the   
number of dealers wishing to purchase or sell the security and the number of    
other potential purchasers; (iv) dealer undertakings to make a market in the    
security and (v) the nature of the security and the nature of the marketplace   
trades (e.g., the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of         
soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer).                           

   Emerging Growth and Smaller Capitalization Companies; Unseasoned Issuers.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investments in securities of small- and medium-sized, emerging growth companies 
and companies with continuous operations of less than three years ("unseasoned  
issuers") involve considerations that are not applicable to investing in        
securities of established, larger-capitalization issuers, including reduced and 
less reliable information about issuers and markets, less stringent financial   
disclosure requirements, illiquidity of securities and markets, higher brokerage
commissions and fees and greater market risk in general. Securities of these    
companies may also involve greater risks since these securities may have limited
marketability and, thus, may be more volatile. Because such companies normally  
have fewer shares outstanding than larger, more established companies, it may be
more difficult for the Fund to buy or sell significant amounts of such shares   
without an unfavorable impact on prevailing prices. These companies may have    
limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may lack management   
depth. In addition, these companies are typically subject to a greater degree of
changes in earnings and business prospects than are larger, more established    
companies. Although investing in securities of these companies offers potential 
for above-average returns if the companies are successful, the risk exists that 
the companies will not succeed and the prices of the companies' shares could    
significantly decline in value.                                                 

   Rights Offerings and Purchase Warrants. The Fund may invest in rights and
--------------------------------------                                
warrants to purchase newly created equity securities consisting of common and   
preferred stock. The equity security underlying a right or warrant is           
outstanding at the time the right or warrant is issued or is issued together    
with the right or warrant.                                                      

A-19

P-->485APOS40th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
     Investing in rights and warrants can provide a greater potential for profit
or loss than an equivalent investment in the underlying security, and, thus, can
be a speculative investment. The value of a right or warrant may decline because
of a decline in the value of the underlying security, the passage of time,      
changes in interest rates or in the dividend or other policies of the company   
whose equity underlies the warrant or a change in the perception as to the      
future price of the underlying security, or any combination thereof. Rights and 
warrants generally pay no dividends and confer no voting or other rights other  
than to purchase the underlying security.                                       

Borrowing. The Fund may borrow up to 33-1/3% of its total assets for  
---------                                                             
temporary or emergency purposes, including to meet portfolio redemption requests
so as to permit the orderly disposition of portfolio securities or to facilitate
settlement transactions on portfolio securities. Investments (including         
roll-overs) will not be made when borrowings exceed 5% of the Fund's net assets.
Although the principal of such borrowings will be fixed, the Fund's assets may  
change in value during the time the borrowing is outstanding. The Fund expects  
that some of its borrowings may be made on a secured basis. In such situations, 
either the custodian will segregate the pledged assets for the benefit of the   
lender or arrangements will be made with a suitable subcustodian, which may     
include the lender.                                                             

Other Investment Limitations                                          
----------------------------                                          

    The investment limitations numbered 1 through 8 may not be changed without
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Fund's outstanding     
shares. Such majority is defined as the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the shares 
present at the meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding      
shares of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of
the outstanding shares. Investment limitations 9 through 14 may be changed by a 
vote of the Board at any time.                                                  

The Fund may not:                                                     

1.   Borrow money except that the Fund may (a) borrow from banks for  
temporary or emergency purposes and (b) enter into reverse repurchase           
agreements; provided that reverse repurchase agreements, dollar roll            
transactions that are accounted for as financings and any other transactions    
constituting borrowing by the Fund may not exceed 33-1/3% of the value of the   
Fund's total assets at the time of such borrowing. For purposes of this         
restriction, the entry into currency transactions, options, futures contracts,  
options on futures contracts, forward commitment transactions and dollar roll   
transactions that are not accounted for as financings (and the segregation of   
assets in connection with any of the foregoing) shall not constitute borrowing. 

    2.   Purchase any securities which would cause 25% or more of the value of
the Fund's total assets at the time of purchase to be invested in the securities
of issuers conducting their principal business activities in the same industry; 
provided that to the extent the benchmark of the Fund is concentrated in a      
particular industry, the Fund will be concentrated in that industry. This       
limitation shall not apply to the purchase of U.S. Government Securities.       

   3.   Purchase the securities of any issuer if as a result more than 5% of
the value of the Fund's total assets would be invested in the securities of such
issuer, except that this 5%                                                     

A-20

limitation does not apply to U.S. Government Securities and except that up to   
25% of the value of the Fund's total assets may be invested without regard to   
this 5% limitation.                                                             

4.  Make loans, except that the Fund may purchase or hold fixed-income
securities, including structured securities, lend portfolio securities and enter
into repurchase agreements.                                                     

  5.  Underwrite any securities issued by others except to the extent that
investment in restricted securities and the sale of securities in accordance    
with the Fund's investment goal, policies and limitations may be deemed to be   
underwriting.                                                                   

6.  Purchase or sell real estate or invest in oil, gas or mineral     
exploration or development programs, except that the Fund may invest in (a)     
securities secured by real estate, mortgages or interests therein and (b)       
securities of companies that invest in or sponsor oil, gas or mineral           
exploration or development programs.                                            

7.  Invest in commodities, except that the Fund may purchase and sell 
futures contracts, including those relating to securities, currencies and       
indices, and options on futures contracts, securities, currencies or indices,   
and purchase and sell currencies on a forward commitment or delayed-delivery    
basis.                                                                          

    8.  Issue any senior security except as permitted in the Fund's investment
limitations.                                                                    

9.  Purchase securities on margin, except that the Fund may obtain any
short-term credits necessary for the clearance of purchases and sales of        
securities. For purposes of this restriction, the deposit or payment of initial 
or variation margin in connection with transactions in currencies, options,     
futures contracts or related options will not be deemed to be a purchase of     
securities on margin.                                                           

    10. Purchase securities of other investment companies except in connection
with a merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization or offer of exchange, 
or as otherwise permitted under the 1940 Act.                                   

11. Pledge, mortgage or hypothecate its assets, except to the extent  
necessary to secure permitted borrowings and to the extent related to the       
deposit of assets in escrow and in connection with the writing of covered put   
and call options and purchase of securities on a forward commitment or          
delayed-delivery basis and collateral and initial or variation margin           
arrangements with respect to currency transactions, options, futures contracts, 
and options on futures contracts.                                               

   12. Invest more than 15% of the Fund's net assets in securities which may
be illiquid because of legal or contractual restrictions on resale or securities
for which there are no readily available market quotations. For purposes of this
limitation, repurchase agreements with maturities greater than seven days shall 
be considered illiquid securities.                                              

    13. Invest in rights and warrants (other than rights and warrants acquired
by the Fund as part of a unit or attached to securities at the time of purchase)
if, as a result, the investments (valued at the lower of cost or market) would  
exceed 10% of the value of the Fund's net assets.                               

A-21

P-->485APOS42nd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
14. Make additional investments (including roll-overs) if the Fund's  
borrowings exceed 5% of its net assets.                                         

     If a percentage restriction (other than the percentage limitation set forth
in No. 1 and No. 12) is adhered to at the time of an investment, a later        
increase or decrease in the percentage of assets resulting from a change in the 
values of portfolio securities or in the amount of the Fund's assets will not   
constitute a violation of such restriction.                                     

Portfolio Valuation                                                             
-------------------                                                             

    The Prospectus discusses the time at which the net asset value of the Fund
is determined for purposes of sales and redemptions. The following is a         
description of the procedures used by the Fund in valuing its assets.           

Securities listed on a U.S. securities exchange (including securities 
traded through the NASDAQ National Market System) or foreign securities exchange
or traded in an over-the-counter market will be valued at the most recent sale  
as of the time the valuation is made or, in the absence of sales, at the mean   
between the bid and asked quotations. If there are no such quotations, the value
of the securities will be taken to be the highest bid quotation on the exchange 
or market. Options or futures contracts will be valued similarly. Stock index   
options will be valued at the last price, but if that price does not fall within
the bid and ask price for the stock index option when the market closes at 4:15 
p.m. Eastern Time, then the stock index option will be valued at the mean       
between the bid and asked quotations. A security which is listed or traded on   
more than one exchange is valued at the quotation on the exchange determined to 
be the primary market for such security. Short-term obligations with maturities 
of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which constitutes fair value as
determined by the Board. Amortized cost involves valuing a portfolio instrument 
at its initial cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity 
of any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest    
rates on the market value of the instrument. The amortized cost method of       
valuation may also be used with respect to other debt obligations with 60 days  
or less remaining to maturity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining the
market value of portfolio investments, the Fund may employ outside organizations
(a "Price Service") which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method   
that takes into consideration market indexes, matrices, yield curves and other  
specific adjustments. The procedures of Pricing Services are reviewed           
periodically by the officers of the Fund under the general supervision and      
responsibility of the Board, which may replace a Pricing Service at any time.   
Securities, options and futures contracts for which market quotations are not   
available and certain other assets of the Fund will be valued at their fair     
value as determined in good faith pursuant to consistently applied procedures   
established by the Board. In addition, the Board or its delegates may value a   
security at fair value if it determines that such security's value determined by
the methodology set forth above does not reflect its fair value.                

    Trading in securities in certain foreign countries is completed at various
times prior to the close of business on each business day in New York (i.e., a  
day on which The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") is open for         
trading). In addition, securities trading in a particular country or countries  
may not take place on all business days in New York. Furthermore, trading takes 
place in various foreign markets on days which are not business days in New York
and                                                                             

A-22

P-->485APOS43rd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
days on which the Fund's net asset value is not calculated. As a result,        
calculation of the Fund's net asset value may not take place contemporaneously  
with the determination of the prices of certain foreign portfolio securities    
used in such calculation. Events affecting the values of portfolio securities   
that occur between the time their prices are determined and the close of regular
trading on the NYSE will not be reflected in the Fund's calculation of net asset
value unless the Board or its delegates deems that the particular event would   
materially affect net asset value, in which case an adjustment may be made. All 
assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currency values will be   
converted into U.S. dollar values at the prevailing rate as quoted by a Pricing 
Service. If such quotations are not available, the rate of exchange will be     
determined in good faith pursuant to consistently applied procedures established
by the Board.                                                                   

Portfolio Transactions                                                          
----------------------                                                          

  The Fund's Adviser is responsible for establishing, reviewing and, where
necessary, modifying the Fund's investment program to achieve its investment    
goal. Purchases and sales of newly issued portfolio securities are usually      
principal transactions without brokerage commissions effected directly with the 
issuer or with an underwriter acting as principal. Other purchases and sales may
be effected on a securities exchange or over-the-counter, depending on where it 
appears that the best price or execution will be obtained. The purchase price   
paid by the Fund to underwriters of newly issued securities usually includes a  
concession paid by the issuer to the underwriter, and purchases of securities   
from dealers, acting as either principals or agents in the after market, are    
normally executed at a price between the bid and asked price, which includes a  
dealer's mark-up or mark-down. Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges and some    
foreign stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions.
On exchanges on which commissions are negotiated, the cost of transactions may  
vary among different brokers. On most foreign exchanges, commissions are        
generally fixed. There is generally no stated commission in the case of         
securities traded in domestic or foreign over-the-counter markets, but the price
of securities traded in over-the-counter markets includes an undisclosed        
commission or mark-up. U.S. Government Securities are generally purchased from  
underwriters or dealers, although certain newly issued U.S. Government          
Securities may be purchased directly from the U.S. Treasury or from the issuing 
agency or instrumentality.                                                      

The Adviser will select specific portfolio investments and effect     
transactions for the Fund and in doing so seeks to obtain the overall best      
execution of portfolio transactions. In evaluating prices and executions, the   
Adviser will consider the factors it deems relevant, which may include the      
breadth of the market in the security, the price of the security, the financial 
condition and execution capability of a broker or dealer and the reasonableness 
of the commission, if any, for the specific transaction and on a continuing     
basis. The Adviser may, in its discretion, effect transactions in portfolio     
securities with dealers who provide brokerage and research services (as those   
terms are defined in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) to   
the Fund and/or other accounts over which the Adviser exercises investment      
discretion. The Adviser may place portfolio transactions with a broker or dealer
with whom it has negotiated a commission that is in excess of the commission    
another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the transaction if the
Adviser determines in good faith that the amount of commission was reasonable in
relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such   
broker or dealer viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or of the
overall responsibilities of the Adviser. Research and other services received   
may be useful to the                                                            

A-23

P-->485APOS44th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
Adviser in serving both the Fund and the Adviser's other clients and,           
conversely, research or other services obtained by the placement of business of 
other clients may be useful to the Adviser in carrying out its obligations to   
the Fund. Research may include furnishing advice, either directly or through    
publications or writings, as to the value of securities, the advisability of    
purchasing or selling specific securities and the availability of securities or 
purchasers or sellers of securities; furnishing seminars, information, analyses 
and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, trading markets and     
methods, legislative developments, changes in accounting practices, economic    
factors and trends and portfolio strategy; access to research analysts,         
corporate management personnel, industry experts, economists and government     
officials; comparative performance evaluation and technical measurement services
and quotation services; and products and other services (such as third party    
publications, reports and analyses, and computer and electronic access,         
equipment, software, information and accessories that deliver, process or       
otherwise utilize information, including the research described above) that     
assist the Adviser in carrying out its responsibilities. Research received from 
brokers or dealers is supplemental to the Adviser's own research program. The   
fees payable to Centurion under its advisory agreement with the Fund, and the   
fees payable to the sub-adviser under its respective sub-advisory agreement with
Centurion, are not reduced by reason of the Adviser receiving any brokerage and 
research services.                                                              

    Investment decisions for the Fund concerning specific portfolio securities
are made independently from those for other clients advised by the Adviser. Such
other investment clients may invest in the same securities as the Fund. When    
purchases or sales of the same security are made at substantially the same time 
on behalf of such other clients, transactions are averaged as to price and      
available investments allocated as to amount, in a manner which the Adviser     
believes to be equitable to each client, including the Fund. In some instances, 
this investment procedure may adversely affect the price paid or received by the
Fund or the size of the position obtained or sold for the Fund. To the extent   
permitted by law, the Adviser may aggregate the securities to be sold or        
purchased for the Fund with those to be sold or purchased for such other        
investment clients in order to obtain best execution. In no instance will       
portfolio securities be purchased from or sold to the Adviser or its affiliates.

    Transactions for the Fund may be effected on foreign securities exchanges.
In transactions for securities not actively traded on a foreign securities      
exchange, the Fund will deal directly with the dealers who make a market in the 
securities involved, except in those circumstances where more accurate prices   
and execution are available elsewhere. Such dealers usually are acting as       
principal for their own account. On occasion, securities may be purchased       
directly from the issuer. Such portfolio securities are generally traded on a   
net basis and do not normally involve brokerage commissions. Securities firms   
may receive brokerage commissions on certain portfolio transactions, including  
options, futures and options on futures transactions and the purchase and sale  
of underlying securities upon exercise of options.                              

The Fund may participate, if and when practicable, in bidding for the 
purchase of securities for its portfolio directly from an issuer in order to    
take advantage of the lower purchase price available to members of such a group.
The Fund will engage in this practice, however, only when the Adviser, in its   
sole discretion, believes such practice to be otherwise in the Fund's interest.

The fund has paid the following in brokerage commissions for portfolio      
transactions:

Portfolio Turnover                                                    
------------------                                                    

   As discussed in the Prospectus, the Company anticipates that investors in
the Fund, as part of a tactical or strategic asset allocation strategy, may     
frequently redeem or exchange shares of the Fund. The Fund may have to dispose  
of certain portfolio investments to maintain sufficient liquid assets to meet   
such redemption and exchange requests, thereby resulting in higher portfolio    
turnover. Because the Fund's portfolio turnover rate to a great extent will     
depend on the purchase, redemption and exchange activity of the Fund's          
investors, it is difficult to estimate what the Fund's actual turnover rate will
be in the future.                                                               

A Fund's portfolio turnover rate is calculated by the value of the    
securities purchased or sold, excluding all securities whose maturities at the  
time of acquisition were one year or less, divided by the average monthly value 
of such securities owned during the year. Based on this calculation,            
instruments, including options and futures contracts, with remaining maturities 
of less than one year are excluded from the portfolio turnover rate. In any     
given period, all of the Fund's investments may have a remaining maturity of    
less than one year; in which case, the portfolio turnover rate for that period  
would be equal to zero.                                                         

The portfolio turnover rates are as follows:

      The business and affairs of the Fund is managed by the Company's Board
in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland. The Board elects officers 
who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Fund and who execute   
policies formulated by the Board. Under the Company's Charter, the Board may    
classify or reclassify any unissued shares of the Company into one or more      
additional classes by setting or changing in any one or more respects their     
relative rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends,      
qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption. The Board may similarly  
classify or reclassify any class of the Company's shares into one or more series
and, without shareholder approval, may increase the number of authorized shares 
of the Company.                                                                 

   The names (and ages) of the Company's directors and officers, their
addresses, present positions and principal occupations during the past five     
years and other affiliations are set forth below. An asterisk appears after the 
name of each director who is an "interested person" of the Company, as defined  
in the 1940 Act.

net asset value. Information on how to purchase and redeem Fund shares and how  
such shares are priced is included in the Prospectus.                           

Under the 1940 Act, the Fund may suspend the right of redemption or   
postpone the date of payment upon redemption for any period during which the    
NYSE is closed, other than customary weekend and holiday closings, or during    
which trading on the NYSE is restricted, or during which (as determined by the  
SEC) an emergency exists as a result of which disposal or fair valuation of     
portfolio securities is not reasonably practicable, or for such other periods as
the

SEC may permit. (The Fund may also suspend or postpone the recordation of an    
exchange of its shares upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing conditions.) 

If the Board determines that conditions exist which make payment of   
redemption proceeds wholly in cash unwise or undesirable, the Fund may make     
payment wholly or partly in securities or other investment instruments which may
not constitute securities as such term is defined in the applicable securities  
laws. If a redemption is paid wholly or partly in securities or other property, 
a shareholder would incur transaction costs in disposing of the redemption      
proceeds. The Fund intends to comply with Rule 18f-1 promulgated under the 1940 
Act with respect to redemptions in kind.                                        

EXCHANGE PRIVILEGE

     You may only exchange shares of the Fund for shares of another Fund offered
by the Compay. Currently, there are no Fund exchange privileges. An exchange    
privilege enables shareholders to acquire shares in a Fund with a different     
investment goal when they believe that a shift between Funds is an appropriate  
investment decision. This privilege is available to shareholders residing in any
state in which the shares being acquired may legally be sold. Prior to any      
exchange, shareholders should review a copy of the current prospectus of the    
Fund into which an exchange is being considered.                                

     Upon receipt of proper instructions and all necessary supporting documents,
shares submitted for exchange are redeemed at the then-current net asset value  
of the Fund and the proceeds are invested on the same day, at a price as        
described above, in shares of the Fund being acquired. The exchange privilege   
may be modified or terminated at any time upon 30 days' notice to shareholders. 

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING TAXES

     The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax
considerations regarding the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of   
the Fund. Each prospective shareholder is urged to consult his own tax adviser  
with respect to the specific federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences 
of investing in the Fund. The summary is based on the laws in effect on the date
of this SAI, which are subject to change.

least 90% of its gross income in each taxable year from dividends, interest,    
payments with respect to securities, loans and gains from the sale or other     
disposition of stock or securities or foreign currencies, or other income       
(including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward          
contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,     
securities or currencies; and (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of 
each quarter of the Fund's taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of
the Fund's assets is represented by cash, securities of other regulated         
investment companies, United States government securities and other securities, 
with such other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount  
not greater than 5% of the Fund's assets and not greater than 10% of the

outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (ii) not more than 25% of the  
value of its assets is invested in the securities (other than United States     
government securities or securities of other regulated investment companies) of 
any one issuer or any two or more issuers that the Fund controls and are        
determined to be engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses or related 
trades or businesses.                                                           

   As a regulated investment company, the Fund will not be subject to United
States federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (i.e., income
other than any excess of its net realized long-term capital gains over its net  
realized short-term capital losses ("net-realized capital gains") and on its net
realized capital gains, if any, that it distributes to its shareholders,        
provided that an amount equal to at least 90% of the sum of its investment      
company taxable income plus or minus certain other adjustments as specified in  
the Code) and its net tax-exempt income for the taxable year is distributed, but
will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on any taxable income or gains
that it does not distribute. Furthermore, the Fund will be subject to a United  
States corporate income tax with respect to such distributed amounts in any year
that it fails to qualify as a regulated investment company or fails to meet this
distribution requirement.                                                       

  The Code imposes a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the Fund to the extent
the Fund does not distribute by the end of any calendar year at least 98% of its
net investment income and 98% of the net amount of its capital gains (both      
long-term and short-term) for the one-year period ending, as a general rule, on 
October 31 of that year. For this purpose, however, any income or gain retained 
by the Fund that is subject to corporate income tax will be considered to have  
been distributed by year-end. In addition, the minimum amounts that must be     
distributed in any year to avoid the excise tax will be increased or decreased  
to reflect any underdistribution or overdistribution, as the case may be, from  
the previous year. The Fund anticipates that it will pay such dividends and will
make such distributions as are necessary in order to avoid the application of   
this tax.                                                                       

With regard to the Fund's investments in foreign securities, exchange 
control regulations may restrict repatriations of investment income and capital 
or the proceeds of securities sales by foreign investors such as the Fund and   
may limit the Fund's ability to pay sufficient dividends and to make sufficient 
distributions to satisfy the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements.      

If, in any taxable year, the Fund fails to qualify as a regulated     
investment company under the Code or fails to meet the distribution requirement,
it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and             
distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the Fund in        
computing its taxable income. In addition, in the event of a failure to qualify,
the Fund's distributions, to the extent derived from the Fund's current or      
accumulated earnings and profits, would constitute dividends (eligible for the  
corporate dividends-received deduction) which are taxable to shareholders as    
ordinary income, even though those distributions might otherwise (at least in   
part) have been treated in the shareholders' hands as long-term capital gains.  
If the Fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company in any year, it  
must pay out its earnings and profits accumulated in that year in order to      
qualify again as a regulated investment company. In addition, if the Fund failed
to qualify as a regulated investment company for a period greater than one      
taxable year, the Fund may be required to recognize any net built-in gains with 
respect to certain of its assets (the excess of the aggregate gains, including  
items of income, over                                                           

A-32

P-->485APOS53rd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
aggregate losses that would have been realized if the Fund had been liquidated) 
in order to qualify as a regulated investment company in a subsequent year.     

   The Fund's transactions in foreign currencies, forward contracts, options
and futures contracts (including options and futures contracts on foreign       
currencies) will be subject to special provisions of the Code (including        
provisions relating to "hedging transactions" and "straddles") that, among other
things, may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the Fund (i.e.,
may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate         
recognition of income to the Fund and defer Fund losses. These rules could      
therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to           
shareholders. These provisions also (a) will require the Fund to mark-to-market 
certain types of the positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they    
were closed out) and (b) may cause the Fund to recognize income without         
receiving cash with which to pay dividends or make distributions in amounts     
necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements for avoiding income and      
excise taxes. The Fund will monitor its transactions, will make the appropriate 
tax elections and will make the appropriate entries in its books and records    
when it acquires any foreign currency, forward contract, option, futures        
contract or hedged investment in order to mitigate the effect of these rules and
prevent disqualification of the Fund as a regulated investment company.         

    The Fund's investment in Section 1256 contracts, such as regulated futures
contracts, most forward currency forward contracts traded in the interbank      
market and options on most stock indices, are subject to special tax rules. All 
section 1256 contracts held by the Fund at the end of its taxable year are      
required to be marked to their market value, and any unrealized gain or loss on 
those positions will be included in the Fund's income as if each position had   
been sold for its fair market value at the end of the taxable year. The         
resulting gain or loss will be combined with any gain or loss realized by the   
Fund from positions in section 1256 contracts closed during the taxable year.   
Provided such positions were held as capital assets and were not part of a      
"hedging transaction" nor part of a "straddle," 60% of the resulting net gain or
loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss, and 40% of such net gain
or loss will be treated as short-term capital gain or loss, regardless of the   
period of time the positions were actually held by the Fund.                    

At September 30, 2001, the unused capital loss carryovers of the Fund were      
approximately $_____________, The carryovers expire on ______________. For      
federal income tax purposes, these amounts are available to be applied against  
future realized capital gains, if any. The carryovers expire as follows:        

As a result of entering into index swaps, the Fund may make or receive
periodic net payments. The Fund may also make or receive a payment when a swap  
is terminated prior to maturity through an assignment of the swap or other      
closing transaction. Periodic net payments will constitute ordinary income or   
deductions, while termination of a swap will result in capital gain or loss     
(which will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the Fund has been a party to 
the swap for more than one year).                                               

Passive Foreign Investment Companies. If the Fund purchases shares in 
certain foreign investment entities, called "passive foreign investment         
companies" (a "PFIC"), it may be subject to United States federal income tax on 
a portion of any "excess distribution" or gain from the                         

A-33

P-->485APOS54th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�54th
disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable      
dividend by the Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of   
interest may be imposed on the Fund in respect of deferred taxes arising from   
such distributions or gains. If the Fund were to invest in a PFIC and elected to
treat the PFIC as a "qualified electing fund" under the Code, in lieu of the    
foregoing requirements, the Fund might be required to include in income each    
year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified  
electing fund, even if not distributed to the Fund, and such amounts would be   
subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements described above. In 
order to make this election, the Fund would be required to obtain certain annual
information from the PFICs in which it invests, which may be difficult or not   
possible to obtain.                                                             

Alternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-market election that would 
result in the Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased all of the   
PFIC stock at the end of each year. In this case, the Fund would report gains as
ordinary income and would deduct losses as ordinary losses to the extent of     
previously recognized gains. The election, once made, would be effective for all
subsequent taxable years of the Fund, unless revoked with the consent of the    
IRS. By making the election, the Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse  
tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC, but in any  
particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the            
distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC 
stock. The Fund may have to distribute this "phantom" income and gain to satisfy
its distribution requirement and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax.      

     The Fund will make the appropriate tax elections, if possible, and take any
additional steps that are necessary to mitigate the effect of these rules.      

Taxation of United States Shareholders                                          
--------------------------------------                                          

Dividends and Distributions. Any dividend declared by the Fund in October,
November or December of any calendar year and payable to shareholders of record 
on a specified date in such a month shall be deemed to have been received by    
each shareholder on December 31 of such calendar year and to have been paid by  
the Fund not later than such December 31, provided that such dividend is        
actually paid by the Fund during January of the following calendar year. The    
Fund intends to distribute annually to its shareholders substantially all of its
investment company taxable income, and any net realized long-term capital gains 
in excess of net realized short-term capital losses (including any capital loss 
carryovers). The Fund currently expects to distribute any such excess annually  
to its shareholders. However, if the Fund retains for investment an amount equal
to all or a portion of its net long-term capital gains in excess of its net     
short-term capital losses and capital loss carryovers, it will be subject to a  
corporate tax (currently at a rate of 35%) on the amount retained. In that      
event, the Fund will designate such retained amounts as undistributed capital   
gains in a notice to its shareholders who (a) will be required to include in    
income for United Stares federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital      
gains, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount, (b) will be      
entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the 35% tax paid by the Fund on
the undistributed amount against their United States federal income tax         
liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the extent their credits exceed    
their liabilities, if any, and (c) will be entitled to increase their tax basis,
for United States federal income tax purposes, in their shares by an amount     
equal to 65% of the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the       
shareholder's income. Organizations or persons not                              

A-34

P-->485APOS55th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�55th
subject to federal income tax on such capital gains will be entitled to a refund
of their pro rata share of such taxes paid by the Fund upon filing appropriate  
returns or claims for refund with the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS").     

Dividends of net investment income and distributions of net realized  
short-term capital gains are taxable to a United States shareholder as ordinary 
income, whether paid in cash or in shares. Distributions of net long-term       
capital gains, if any, that the Fund designates as capital gains dividends are  
taxable as long-term capital gains, whether paid in cash or in shares and       
regardless of how long a shareholder has held shares of the Fund. Dividends and 
distributions paid by the Fund (except for the portion thereof, if any,         
attributable to dividends on stock of U.S. corporations received by the Fund)   
will not qualify for the deduction for dividends received by corporations.      
Distributions in excess of the Fund's current and accumulated earnings and      
profits will, as to each shareholder, be treated as a tax-free return of        
capital, to the extent of a shareholder's basis in his shares of the Fund, and  
as a capital gain thereafter (if the shareholder holds his shares of the Fund as
capital assets).                                                                

     Shareholders receiving dividends or distributions in the form of additional
shares should be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as       
receiving a distribution in the amount equal to the amount of money that the    
shareholders receiving cash dividends or distributions will receive, and should 
have a cost basis in the shares received equal to such amount.                  

 Investors considering buying shares just prior to a dividend or capital
gain distribution should be aware that, although the price of shares just       
purchased at that time may reflect the amount of the forthcoming distribution,  
such dividend or distribution may nevertheless be taxable to them.              

     If the Fund is the holder of record of any stock on the record date for any
dividends payable with respect to such stock, such dividends are included in    
the Fund's gross income not as of the date received but as of the later of (a)  
the date such stock became ex-dividend with respect to such dividends (i.e., the
date on which a buyer of the stock would not be entitled to receive the         
declared, but unpaid, dividends) or (b) the date the Fund acquired such stock.  
Accordingly, in order to satisfy its income distribution requirements, the Fund 
may be required to pay dividends based on anticipated earnings, and shareholders
may receive dividends in an earlier year than would otherwise be the case.      

 Sales of Shares. Upon the sale or exchange of his shares, a shareholder
will realize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount  
realized and his basis in his shares. Such gain or loss will be treated as      
capital gain or loss, if the shares are capital assets in the shareholder's     
hands, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held for    
more than one year and short-term capital gain or loss if the shares are held   
for one year or less. Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed
to the extent the shares disposed of are replaced, including replacement through
the reinvesting of dividends and capital gains distributions in the Fund, within
a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the           
disposition of the shares. In such a case, the basis of the shares acquired will
be increased to reflect the disallowed loss. Any loss realized by a shareholder 
on the sale of the Fund share held by the shareholder for six months or less    
will be treated for United States federal                                       

A-35

P-->485APOS56th�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�56th
income tax purposes as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any            
distributions or deemed distributions of long-term capital gains received by the
shareholder with respect to such share.                                         

 Foreign Taxes. The Fund may elect for U.S. income tax purposes to treat
foreign income taxes paid by it as paid by its shareholders if: (i) the Fund    
qualifies as a regulated investment company, (ii) certain asset and distribution
requirements are satisfied, and (iii) more than 50% of the Fund's total assets  
at the close of its fiscal year consists of stock or securities of foreign      
corporations. The Fund may qualify for and make this election in some, but not  
necessarily all, of its taxable years. If the Fund were to make such an         
election, shareholders of the Fund would be required to take into account an    
amount equal to their pro rata portions of such foreign taxes in computing their
taxable income and then treat an amount equal to those foreign taxes as a U.S.  
federal income tax deduction or as a foreign tax credit against their U.S.      
federal income taxes. Shortly after any year for which it makes such an         
election, the Fund will report to its shareholders the amount per share of such 
foreign income tax that must be included in each shareholder's gross income and 
the amount which will be available for the deduction or credit. No deduction for
foreign taxes may be claimed by a shareholder who does not itemize deductions.  
Certain limitations will be imposed on the extent to which the credit (but not  
the deduction) for foreign taxes may be claimed.                                

Backup Withholding. The Fund may be required to withhold, for United  
States federal income tax purposes, 31% of the dividends and distributions      
payable to shareholders who fail to provide the Fund with their correct taxpayer
identification number or to make required certifications, or who have been      
notified by the IRS that they are subject to backup withholding. Certain        
shareholders are exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an   
additional tax and any amount withheld may be credited against a shareholder's  
United States federal income tax liabilities.                                   

Notices. Shareholders will be notified annually by the Fund as to the 
United States federal income tax status of the dividends, distributions and     
deemed distributions attributable to undistributed capital gains (discussed     
above in "Dividends and Distributions") made by the Fund to its shareholders.   
Furthermore, shareholders will also receive, if appropriate, various written    
notices after the close of the Fund's taxable year regarding the United States  
federal income tax status of certain dividends, distributions and deemed        
distributions that were paid (or that are treated as having been paid) by the   
Fund to its shareholders during the preceding taxable year.                     

Other Taxation                                                                  
--------------                                                                  

  Distributions also may be subject to additional state, local and foreign
taxes depending on each shareholder's particular situation.

The foregoing is only a summary of certain material tax consequences affecting  
the Fund and its shareholders. Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax
advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an          
investment in the Fund.                                                         

PERFORMANCE DATA

From time to time, the Fund may quote its total return in advertisements or in  
reports and other communications to shareholders. The Fund may include          
comparative performance information in advertising or other materials used to   
market its shares. Such performance information may include the following       
industry and financial publications: Barron's, Business Week, CDA Investment    
Technologies, Inc., Changing Times, Forbes, Fortune, Institutional Investor,    
Investor's Business Daily, Money, Morningstar Mutual Fund Values, The New York  
Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal.                                   

Average Annual Total Return                                                     

The Fund's "average annual total return," as described below, is computed       
according to a formula prescribed by the SEC. The formula can be expressed as   
follows:                                                                        

       P(1 + T)/n/ = ERV

                   Where:   P   =    a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000.

               T   =    average annual total return.

   n   =    number of years.

                            ERV =    Ending Redeemable Value of a hypothetical
                                      $1,000 investment made at the beginning of
                                      a 1-, 5- or 10-year period at the end of a
                                   1-, 5- or 10-year period (or fractional
                                      portion thereof), assuming reinvestment of
                            all dividends and distributions.

The ERV assumes complete redemption of the hypothetical investment at the end of
the measuring period. The Fund's net investment income changes in response to   
fluctuations in interest rates and the expenses of the Fund.

Performance will vary from time to time depending upon market conditions, the   
composition of the Fund's portfolio and its operating expenses. Consequently,   
any given performance quotation should not be considered representative of the  
Fund's performance for any specified period in the future. Because performance  
will vary, it may not provide a basis for comparing an investment in the Fund   
with certain bank deposits or other investments that pay a fixed yield for a    
stated period of time. Investors comparing the Fund's performance with that of  
other mutual funds should give consideration to the quality and maturity of the 
respective investment companies' portfolio securities.

     Investors in the Fund are entitled to one vote for each full share held and
fractional votes for fractional shares held. Shareholders of the Fund will vote 
in the aggregate except where otherwise required by law. There will normally be 
no meetings of investors for the purpose of electing members of the Board unless
and until such time as less than a majority of the members holding office have  
been elected by investors. Any director of the Company may be removed from      
office upon the vote of shareholders holding at least a majority of the         
Company's outstanding shares, at a meeting called for that purpose. A meeting   
will be called for the purpose of voting on the removal of a Board member at the
written request of holders of 10% of the outstanding shares of the Company.     

     All shareholders of the Fund, upon liquidation, will participate ratably in
the Fund's net assets. Shares do not have cumulative voting rights, which means 
that holders of more than 50% of the shares voting for the election of directors
can elect all directors. Shares are transferable but have no preemptive,        
conversion or subscription rights.                                              

Reverse Stock Split                                                             
-------------------                                                             

On November 17, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an         
amendment to the Company's charter to effect a one-for-three reverse stock split
of the Fund's common stock and the related reduction in the Fund's stated       
capital pending approval by the affirmative vote of a majority of the           
outstanding shares of the Fund. The reverse stock split was approved by         
shareholders at a shareholders meeting on December 15, 2000. The reverse stock  
split became effective on December 18, 2000                                     

The effect of the reverse stock split is to reduce the number of shares         
outstanding of the Fund while maintaining the Fund's and each shareholder's     
aggregate net asset value. However, the reverse stock split has the added effect
of reducing the Fund's stated capital. Each shareholder's aggregate investment  
in the Fund will remain unchanged as a result of the proposed Amendment. The    
reverse stock split will have no effect on the number or par value of the Fund's
authorized shares.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS 

Commercial Paper Ratings                                                        
------------------------                                                        

    Commercial paper rated A-1 by Standard and Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P")
indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is strong. Those   
issues determined to possess extremely strong safety characteristics are denoted
with a plus sign designation. Capacity for timely payment on commercial paper   
rated A-2 is satisfactory, but the relative degree of safety is not as high as  
for issues designated A-1.                                                      

The rating Prime-1 is the highest commercial paper rating assigned by 
Moody's. Issuers rated Prime-1 (or related supporting institutions) are         
considered to have a superior capacity for repayment of short-term promissory   
obligations. Issuers rated Prime-2 (or related supporting institutions) are     
considered to have a strong capacity for repayment of short-term promissory     
obligations. This will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics of  
issuers rated Prime-1 but to a lesser degree. Earnings trends and coverage      
ratios, while sound, will be more subject to variation. Capitalization          
characteristics, while still appropriate, may be more affected by external      
conditions. Ample alternative liquidity is maintained.                          

Corporate Bond Ratings                                                          
----------------------                                                          

The following summarizes the ratings used by S&P for corporate bonds: 

   AAA - This is the highest rating assigned by S&P to a debt obligation and
indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal.     

 AA - Debt rated AA has a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay
principal and differs from AAA issues only in small degree.                     

    A - Debt rated A has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal
although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in   
circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher-rated categories.     

  BBB - This is the lowest investment grade. Debt rated BBB is regarded as
having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Although it    
normally exhibits adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay    
interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher
rated categories.                                                               

BB, B and CCC - Debt rated BB and B are regarded, on balance, as      
predominately speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay    
principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation. BB represents a lower 
degree of speculation than B, and CCC the highest degree of speculation. While  
such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these  
are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse        
conditions.                                                                     

A-40

P-->485APOS61st�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�61st
   BB - Debt rated BB has less near-term vulnerability to default than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, which could lead to        
inadequate capacity to meet timely interest and principal payments. The BB      
rating category is also used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is       
assigned an actual or implied BBB rating.                                       

   B - Debt rated B has a greater vulnerability to default but currently has
the capacity to meet interest payments and principal repayments. Adverse        
business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair capacity or      
willingness to pay interest and repay principal. The B rating category is also  
used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied 
BB or BB- rating.                                                               

    CCC - Debt rated CCC has a currently identifiable vulnerability to default
and is dependent upon favorable business, financial and economic conditions to  
meet timely payment of interest and repayment of principal. In the event of     
adverse business, financial or economic conditions, it is not likely to have the
capacity to pay interest and repay principal. The CCC rating category is also   
used for debt subordinated to senior debt that is assigned an actual or implied 
B or B- rating.                                                                 

   CC - This rating is typically applied to debt subordinated to senior debt
that is assigned an actual or implied CCC rating.                               

  C - This rating is typically applied to debt subordinated to senior debt
which is assigned an actual or implied CCC- debt rating. The C rating may be    
used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed, but debt  
service payments are continued.                                                 

Additionally, the rating CI is reserved for income bonds on which no  
interest is being paid. Such debt is rated between debt rated C and debt rated  
D.                                                                              

    To provide more detailed indications of credit quality, the ratings may be
modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing      
within this major rating category.                                              

    D - Debt rated D is in payment default. The D rating category is used when
interest payments or principal payments are not made on the date due even if the
applicable grace period has not expired, unless S&P believes that such payments 
will be made during such grace period. The D rating also will be used upon the  
filing of a bankruptcy petition if debt service payments are jeopardized.       

   The following summarizes the ratings used by Moody's for corporate bonds:

   Aaa - Bonds that are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as   
"gilt edged." Interest payments are protected by a large or exceptionally stable
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the    
fundamentally strong position of such issues.                                   

Aa - Bonds that are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all  
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known as
high grade bonds. They are rated                                                

A-41

P-->485APOS62nd�Page�of�70TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�62nd
lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as  
in Aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater       
amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long-term risks 
appear somewhat larger than in Aaa securities.                                  

  A - Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes
and are to be considered as upper-medium-grade obligations. Factors giving      
security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be 
present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.    

     Baa - Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium-grade obligations,
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payments   
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

Ba - Bonds which are rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements;
their future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection of      
interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well       
safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future. Uncertainty of      
position characterizes bonds in this class.                                     

 B - Bonds which are rated B generally lack characteristics of desirable
investments. Assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of  
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.          

    Moody's applies numerical modifiers (1, 2 and 3) with respect to the bonds
rated "Aa" through "B." The modifier 1 indicates that the bond being rated ranks
in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a    
mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the bond ranks in the lower
end of its generic rating category.                                             

     Caa - Bonds that are rated Caa are of poor standing. These issues may be in
default or present elements of danger may exist with respect to principal or    
interest.                                                                       

   Ca - Bonds which are rated Ca represent obligations which are speculative
in a high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked         
shortcomings.                                                                   

   C - Bonds which are rated C comprise the lowest rated class of bonds, and
issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever      
attaining any real investment standing.

Registrant or its stockholders for money damages, to the fullest extent         
permitted by Maryland law. This limitation on liability applies to events       
occurring at the time a person serves as a Director or officer of Registrant    
whether or not such person is a Director or officer at the time of any          
proceeding in which liability is asserted. No provision of Article VIII shall   
protect or purport to protect any Director or officer of Registrant against any 
liability to Registrant or its stockholders to which he would otherwise be      
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or        
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.         
Registrant shall indemnify and advance expenses to its currently acting and its 
former Director to the fullest extent that indemnification of Directors and     
advancement of expenses to Directors is permitted by the Maryland General       
Corporation Law.                                                                

        Registrant shall indemnify and advance expenses to its officers to the
same extent as its Directors and to such further extent as is consistent with   
such law. The Board of Directors may, through a by-law, resolution or agreement,
make further provisions for indemnification of directors, officers, employees   
and agents to the fullest extent permitted by the Maryland General Corporation  
Law.                                                                            

        Article V of the By-laws further limits the liability of the Directors
by providing that any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,       
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact 
that such person is a current or former director or officer of Registrant, or is
or was serving while a director or officer of Registrant at the request of      
Registrant as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, agent or         
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise 
or employee benefit plan, shall be

indemnified by Registrant against judgments, penalties, fines, excise taxes,    
settlements and reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually        
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding to   
the full extent permissible under the Maryland General Corporation Law, the 1993
Act and the 1940 Act, as such statutes are now or hereafter in force, except    
that such indemnity shall not protect any such person against any liability to  
Registrant or any stockholder thereof to which such person would otherwise be   
subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or        
reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of this office.        

 Additionally, with respect to indemnification against liability
incurred by Registrant's distributor, reference is made to Paragraph 4.1 of the 
form of Distribution Agreement filed herewith. With respect to indemnification  
against liability incurred by Registrant's investment manager and sub-advisers, 
reference is made to Section 5 of each form of Investment Advisory Agreement and

incorporated by reference to Pre-Effective Amendment No. 1 to Registrant's

SAVOS INVESTMENTS TRUST
Contra Fund
1655 Grant Street, 10th Floor
Concord, CA 94520

June 5, 2015
�
Dear Shareholder:
�
Enclosed is a Notice, Proxy Statement and proxy card(s) for a special meeting of shareholders (the �Meeting�) of Savos Investments Trust (the �Trust�) relating to its series, the Contra Fund (the �Fund�). The Meeting will be held at the principal executive offices of the Trust at 1655 Grant Street, 10th Floor, Concord, CA 94520 on Tuesday, June 30, 2015 at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time. The purpose of the Meeting is to elect four Trustees for the Trust, three of which are new. As a shareholder, you have the opportunity to vote on this proposal. This package contains information
about the proposal and the materials to use when voting by mail or through the Internet.
�
In order to provide cost and operational efficiencies moving forward, the current Board of Trustees (the �Board�) of the Trust has determined that it would be in the best interest of shareholders to consolidate the Board with the Board of Trustees of GPS Funds I and GPS Funds II (the �GPS Board�), the other funds in the AssetMark, Inc. fund complex. The Trustees who are not �interested persons,� as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, have indicated their intention to resign from the current Board upon the election of the four nominees. The Trust�s sole �Interested Trustee,� Carrie E. Hansen, is currently a member of the GPS Board and it is proposed that she continue to be a member of the Trust�s Board.
�
THE TRUSTEES RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE �FOR� THE PROPOSAL.
�
The proposal has been carefully reviewed by the Trust�s current Board. The Trustees of the Trust, all of whom, except for one, are not affiliated with the Trust�s service providers, are responsible for protecting your interests as a shareholder.
�
Please take a few minutes to read the enclosed materials and cast your vote promptly. Voting is quick and easy. Everything you need is enclosed. To cast your vote, simply complete the proxy card(s) enclosed in this package. Be sure to sign the card(s) before mailing in the postage-paid envelope. You may also vote through the Internet. Simply visit the Web site indicated on your proxy card(s), enter the control number found on the card(s), and follow the online instructions.
�
Your vote is extremely important, no matter how large or small your holdings may be. It is important that your vote be received no later than June 30, 2015. Shareholders who execute proxies may revoke them at any time before they are voted by filing a written notice of revocation with the Trust, by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.
�
Thank you for your participation in this important initiative.
�


�
Sincerely,
�
/s/ Carrie E. Hansen�������������������������������������������
Carrie E. Hansen
President, Trustee and Chairman of the Trust

TO ELECT A BOARD OF TRUSTEES
�
Introduction
�
Shareholders of the Trust are being asked to elect four trustees (together, the �Trustee Nominees�) to the Board of the Trust. All of the Trustee Nominees are currently members of the GPS Board, which oversees GPS Funds I and GPS Funds II (collectively, the �GPS Funds�), the other funds advised by the Fund�s investment advisor, AssetMark. One of the Trustee Nominees, Carrie E. Hansen, is also currently a member of the Board of the Trust.
�
AssetMark�s family of funds is comprised of the Trust and the GPS Funds (collectively, the �AssetMark Funds�). The Trust�s current Board includes a set of individuals who are not �interested persons,� as that term is defined in the 1940 Act (the �Independent Trustees�), that is separate and distinct from the GPS Board. The Independent Trustees of the current Board are John A. Fibiger, Dwight M. Jaffee, and Douglas A. Paul. The Independent Trustee Nominees, David M. Dunford, Paul S. Feinberg, and Dennis G. Schmal, are the Independent Trustees of the GPS Funds. Carrie E. Hansen serves as an �Interested Trustee� for the current Board and the GPS Board.��Shareholders of the Trust are being asked to restructure the Board to create a uniform set of individuals
to serve as Trustees on the Boards of the AssetMark Funds in order to provide cost and operational efficiencies in the future.��If elected, the Board of the Trust would be comprised of the following Trustees: Messrs. Dunford, Feinberg and Schmal as Independent Trustees, and Ms. Hansen as an Interested Trustee (the �Proposed Board�).��Although the Boards for the AssetMark Funds will become a common Board, the Trust and the GPS Funds will remain distinct Trusts.
�
The Trust is governed by its Board, which has oversight responsibility for the management of the Trust�s business affairs.��The Trustees are fiduciaries for the Fund�s shareholders and are subject to the laws of the State of Delaware in this regard. The Board of the Trust oversees the management and affairs of the Trust; establishes policies for the operation of the Fund; oversees and reviews the performance of the advisor, the distributor and others who perform services for the Trust; and appoints the officers who conduct the daily business of the Fund.
�
Who are the Trustee Nominees?
�
The Proposed Board is comprised of four members, three of whom are Independent Trustees. Only Ms. Hansen would be deemed an �Interested Trustee� of the Trust because she is an officer of AssetMark, the investment advisor to the Fund, and certain of its affiliates.��Appendix A contains a list of the Trustee Nominees with certain background and related information.
�
If elected, each Trustee Nominee for the Trust will hold office for the continued lifetime of the Trust until the Trustee�s successor is elected and qualified; until his earlier death, resignation or removal; or until the Trustee is declared bankrupt or incompetent by a court. Each Trustee Nominee currently is available and has consented to serve if elected. If any of the Trustee Nominees should become unavailable before the Meeting, the designated proxy holders will have the authority to vote in their discretion for another person or persons who may be
�



�

� 



nominated as Trustees.��Each of the Trustee Nominees are standing for election by shareholders of the Trust for the first time.
�
How are Nominees for Trustee Selected?
�
The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Trust is responsible for, among other things, identifying and recommending qualified individuals to become Board members.
�
The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Trust is comprised of all of the Independent Trustees of the current Board.��The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Trust meets as often as necessary or appropriate to discharge its functions and reports its actions and recommendations to the Board on a regular basis.��During the fiscal year ended September 31, 2014, the Nominating and Governance Committee met one time.��The Board has adopted and approved a formal written charter for its Nominating and Governance Committee, which is attached as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement.
�
The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Trust met to evaluate candidates for positions on the Board, including evaluating candidates� qualifications for Board membership, as well as such other information as the Committee deemed relevant to its considerations.��The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Trust recommended the Trustee Nominees for nomination by the Independent Trustees and the Independent Trustees and the current Board of the Trust selected and nominated the Trustee Nominees for election by the shareholders of the Trust.
�
The Trust�s Nominating and Governance Committee may consider shareholder recommendations for Trustee nominations.��Shareholders who wish to submit recommendations for nominations to fill a vacancy on the Board must submit their recommendations in writing to the Secretary of the Trust at 1655 Grant Street, 10th Floor, Concord, CA 94520 .��Shareholders should include biographical information and qualifications for any nominees submitted for recommendation. The Nominating and Governance Committee may request additional information deemed reasonably necessary for the Committee
to evaluate such nominee.
�
What are the Trustee Nominees� Qualifications and Experience?
�
The current Board believes that each Trustee Nominee has the qualifications, experience, attributes and skills appropriate to serve as a Trustee of the Trust in light of the Trust�s business and structure. Among the attributes and skills common to all Trustee Nominees are the ability to review, evaluate and discuss information and proposals provided to them regarding the Fund, the ability to interact effectively with AssetMark and other service providers, and the ability to exercise independent business judgment. Each Trustee Nominee�s ability to perform his duties effectively has been attained through: (1) the individual�s business and professional experience and accomplishments; (2) the individual�s experience working with the other Trustees and management; (3) the individual�s prior experience serving in senior executive positions and/or on the boards of other
companies and organizations; and (4) the individual�s educational background, professional training, and/or other experiences.��Generally, no one factor was decisive in determining that an individual should be submitted to shareholders for election as Trustee. Set forth below is a brief description of the specific experience of each Trustee Nominee
�

�
What is the Board�s Leadership Structure?
�
With respect to the Trust, the Trustees have the authority to take all actions necessary in connection with their oversight of the business affairs of the Trust, including, among other things, approving the investment objective, policies and procedures for the Fund. The Trust enters into agreements with various entities to manage the day-to-day operations of the Fund, including AssetMark and the Fund�s other service providers. The Trustees are responsible for approving the agreements between these service providers and the Trust, approving agreements between the advisor and any sub-advisors, and exercising general service provider oversight.
�
Leadership Structure and the Board of Trustees of the Trust. Overall responsibility for overseeing and managing the business and affairs of the Trust rests with the Board. Like most mutual funds, the day-to-day management and operation of the Trust is performed by various service providers to the Trust, such as AssetMark and the Trust�s administrator, transfer agent, distributor and custodian. The Board is responsible for selecting these service providers,
�



� 


3





� 



approving the terms of their contracts regarding the Fund, and exercising general oversight of the service providers. The Board has appointed employees of certain of the Trust�s service providers to serve as officers of the Trust, with responsibility for supervising actively the day-to-day operations of the Trust and reporting to the Board regarding Trust operations. The Board has also appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who administers the Trust�s compliance program and regularly reports to the Board on compliance matters. The Trustees have the authority to take all actions necessary in connection with their oversight of the business affairs of the Trust, including, among other matters, approving the investment objectives, policies and procedures for the Fund. The role of the Board and any individual Trustee is one of oversight and not
of active management of the day-to-day operations or affairs of the Trust.
�
The Board is currently composed of three Independent Trustees and one Trustee who is affiliated with AssetMark � Ms. Hansen � and who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of AssetMark. The Board has appointed Ms. Hansen to serve in the role of Chairman. The Independent Trustees have designated Mr. Fibiger as the Lead Independent Trustee. The Lead Independent Trustee participates in and helps to coordinate the preparation of agendas for Board meetings and acts as a liaison between meetings among the Trust�s officers, other Trustees, AssetMark, other service providers and independent legal counsel to the Independent Trustees. The Lead Independent Trustee may also perform such other functions as may be requested by the other Independent Trustees from time to time. The Board believes that the Trust�s leadership and committee structure is appropriate
because it provides a structure for the Board to oversee and to work effectively with management and service providers and facilitates the exercise of the Board�s independent judgment. The Board�s leadership structure permits important roles for the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of AssetMark, who serves as Chairman of the Trust and oversees AssetMark�s day-to-day management of the Fund, and for the Independent Trustees, through the designation of a Lead Independent Trustee and the participation of the other Independent Trustees. In addition, the committee structure provides for: (1) effective oversight of audit and financial reporting responsibilities through the Audit Committee, (2) an effective forum for considering governance and other matters through the Nominating Committee, and (3) the ability to meet independently with independent counsel and outside the presence of management on financial, governance and risk-oversight related issues. Except
for any duties specified herein or pursuant to the Trust�s Declaration of Trust or By-laws, the designations of Chairman or Lead Independent Trustee do not impose on such Trustee any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than the duties, obligations or liability imposed on such person as a member of the Board generally. The leadership structure of the Board may be changed, at any time and in the discretion of the Board, including in response to changes in circumstances or the characteristics of the Fund.
�
Upon approval of this Proposal, it is anticipated that Ms. Hansen will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board and that Mr. Dunford will be appointed Lead Independent Trustee.
�
Oversight of Risk for the Trust.��The Board oversees risk as part of its general oversight of the Fund. The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, financial, operational and valuation risks. The Fund�s officers, AssetMark and other Fund service providers perform risk management as part of the day-to-day operations of the Fund. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all risks that may affect the Fund and that it is not possible to develop processes or controls to eliminate all risks and their possible effects. Risk
�



�

� 



oversight is addressed as part of various Board and Committee activities, including the following: (1) at regular Board meetings, and on an ad hoc basis as needed, receiving and reviewing reports related to the performance and operations of the Trust, including reports related to the valuation of the Trust�s assets; (2) reviewing and approving, as applicable, the compliance policies and procedures of the Trust, AssetMark, and the Trust�s principal underwriter, fund administrator and transfer agent; (3) meeting with investment personnel to review investment strategies, techniques and the processes used to manage related risks; (4) receiving and reviewing reports regarding key service providers; (5) meeting with and receiving reports from the Trust�s Chief Compliance Officer and other senior officers of the Trust and AssetMark regarding the compliance policies and procedures of the Trust and of its service providers; and (6) meeting
with and receiving reports from other management personnel to discuss risks related to the Fund�s investments and operations. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts its risk oversight role.
�
How Often Does the Board Meet and How are the Trustees Compensated?
�
The current Board held five meetings during the Trust�s last fiscal year.��The Trust does not hold annual meetings at which Trustees are elected.
�
No Independent Trustee owns, beneficially or of record, securities issued by any investment advisor or principal underwriter of the Fund, or a person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with any of the foregoing.��The table below shows the dollar range of shares of the Fund and the aggregate dollar range of shares of the AssetMark Funds that were beneficially owned by each Trustee Nominee as of May 26, 2015.

Who are the Principal Officers of the Trust?
�
Officers of the Trust are appointed by the Trust�s Board and serve at the pleasure of the Board. The table in Appendix C identifies the principal officers of the Trust and provides certain background and related information.
�
What are the Standing Committees of the Board?
�
The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee, and the Valuation Committee.
�
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of the Fund. The Audit Committee oversees the scope of the Fund�s audits, the Fund�s accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, and its internal controls. The Audit Committee approves, and recommends to the Independent Trustees of the Trust for their ratification, the selection, appointment, retention and/or termination of the Trust�s independent registered public accounting firm, and it approves the compensation of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund by the independent registered public accounting firm and all permissible
non-audit services provided by the Trust�s independent registered public accounting firm to AssetMark and affiliated service providers if the engagement relates directly to the Fund�s operations and financial reporting.��The Audit Committee of the Trust is comprised of all of the Independent Trustees of the Trust.��Mr. Fibiger is the Chairman of the Audit Committee for the Trust. Upon approval of the Proposal, it is anticipated that Mr. Schmal, the chairman of the Audit Committee for the GPS Board, will be appointed the Chairman of the Audit Committee for the Trust.��During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Audit Committee met three times.
�
Nominating and Governance Committee. Information on the Nominating and Governance Committee of each GPS Trust is provided above under �How are nominees for Trustee selected?�
�
Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee is responsible for (1) monitoring the valuation of the Fund�s holdings of securities and other investments; and (2) as required,
�



� 


6





� 



determining the fair value of illiquid securities and other holdings after consideration of all relevant factors, which determinations are reported to the Board. The Valuation Committee meets as necessary when a price is not readily available and may take action by vote of any two Committee members. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, the Valuation Committee met eight times.
�
Who is the Trust�s Independent Auditors?
�
Selection of Auditors. The Audit Committee and the Board of the Trust have selected the firm of KPMG LLP (�KPMG�) to serve as the Trust�s independent registered public accounting firm.��Representatives of KPMG are not expected to be present at the Meeting but will be available telephonically if necessary.
�
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 for professional services rendered by KPMG for the audit of the Trust�s annual financial statements and for review of the financial statements included in the Trust�s annual reports or for services that normally are provided by KPMG in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years were $28,000 and $24,000, respectively.
�
Audit-Related Fees. There were no fees billed for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 for assurance and related services rendered by KPMG that were reasonably related to the audit or review of the Trust�s financial statements and not reported under �Audit Fees� above.
�
Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed by KPMG for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 for services provided to each the Trust were $5,310 and $5,310, respectively.��These tax-related services consisted of primarily the review of the tax returns for the Trust. There were no fees billed by KPMG for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 for tax-related services provided to AssetMark or other service providers under common control with Assetmark that relate directly to the operations or financial reporting of the Trust.
�
Aggregate Non-Audit Fees. There were no non-audit fees billed by KPMG for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 for products or services provided by KPMG to the Trust or to AssetMark or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with AssetMark that provides ongoing services to the Trust.
�
The Trust�s Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to AssetMark, and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with AssetMark that provides ongoing services to the Trust, is compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG.��The Trust�s Audit Committee has determined that KPMG�s provision of these services is compatible with maintaining KPMG�s independence.
�
All Other Fees. There were no additional fees paid by the Trust or by AssetMark or other service providers under common control with AssetMark during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013 for products and services provided by KPMG, other than the services reported above.
�

The Trust�s Audit Committee did not approve any of the services described above pursuant to the de minimis exceptions set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) and Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X.
�
What is the Required Vote to Elect Trustees?
�
Provided that Quorum requirements (as defined below in �Voting Information�) have been satisfied, the Trustee Nominees will be elected to the Trust�s Board by the affirmative vote of a plurality of votes cast collectively by shareholders of the Fund.��This means that the four Trustee Nominees receiving the largest number of votes will be elected.
�
THE BOARD OF THE TRUST RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE �FOR� EACH OF THE TRUSTEE NOMINEES.

VOTING INFORMATION
�
How will Shareholder Voting be Handled?
�
Only shareholders of record of the Fund at the close of business on May 26, 2015 (the �Record Date�), will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting on the matter described in this Proxy Statement.��Each shareholder will be entitled to one vote for each full share, and a fractional vote for each fractional share, held in the Fund on the Record Date.
�
The vote of a majority of the shares of the Fund represented at the Meeting, either in person or by proxy (whether or not a quorum is present), may adjourn the Meeting with respect to the Proposal.
�
��It is anticipated that the persons named as proxies on the enclosed proxy card(s) will use the authority granted to them to vote on any adjournment in their discretion.
�
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting.��Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the Proposal.��Broker non-votes are proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner or other person entitled to vote shares on a particular matter for which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote.��This generally occurs only when there is another matter at the meeting for which the brokers or nominees do have discretionary authority to vote, such as the Proposal.
�
Shares of the Fund that are owned by other funds or accounts managed by AssetMark, or its affiliates, will generally be voted in proportion to how shares of the Fund are voted by the Fund�s other shareholders. This practice is commonly referred to as �echo voting.�
�
How do I Ensure my Vote is Accurately Recorded?
�
You may attend the Meeting and vote in person.��You may also vote by completing, signing, and returning the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage paid envelope or through the Internet.��If you return your signed proxy card or vote through the Internet, your vote will be officially cast at the Meeting by the persons appointed as proxies.��A proxy card is, in essence, a ballot.��If you sign and date the proxy card but give no voting instructions, your shares will be voted �FOR ALL� the Trustee Nominees in the Proposal. Your proxies will also be voted in the discretion of the persons appointed as proxies on any other matters that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Meeting, although management of the Trust does not expect any such matters to come before the Meeting.��If your shares are held of record by a broker/dealer
and you wish to vote in person at the Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker of record and present it at the Meeting.
�
May I Revoke my Proxy?
�
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by sending a written notice to the Fund expressly revoking your proxy, by signing and forwarding to the Fund a later-dated proxy, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.��If your shares are held in the name of your broker, you will have to make arrangements with your broker to revoke a previously
�



� 


9





� 



executed proxy.��If you wish to vote in-person at the Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker of record and present it at the Meeting.
�
What Other Matters will be Voted upon at the Meeting?
�
The Board of the Trust does not intend to bring any matters before the Meeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement.��Because the Meeting is a special meeting, the Board of the Trust does not anticipate that any other matters will be brought before the Meeting by others.��However, if any other matter legally comes before the Meeting, proxies will be voted in the discretion of the persons appointed as proxies.
�
Who is Entitled to Vote?
�
Only shareholders of record on the Record Date will be entitled to vote at the Meeting on the matters described in this Proxy Statement.��The table in Appendix D shows the number of outstanding shares of the Fund as of May 26, 2015.
�
What is the Quorum Requirement?
�
A �Quorum� is the minimum number of shares that must be present in order to transact business at the Meeting.
�
One-third (33-1/3%) of the shares of the Trust or the Fund entitled to vote in person or by proxy shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting.
�
Who will Pay the Expenses of the Meeting?
�
The Fund will pay all costs of soliciting proxies from shareholders, including costs related to the printing, mailing and tabulation of proxies. The Fund has engaged AST Fund Solutions, LLC (�AST�) to solicit proxies from brokers, banks,��other institutional holders and individual shareholders at an anticipated cost of approximately $6,000. Fees and expenses may be greater depending on the effort necessary to obtain shareholder votes.
�
What Other Solicitations will be Made?
�
This proxy solicitation is being made by the Board of the Trust for use at the Meeting.��In addition to solicitations by mail, solicitations also may be made by advertisement, telephone, telegram, telecopy, facsimile transmission or other electronic media, or personal contacts.��The Fund will request broker/dealer firms, custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the shares of record.��Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of broker/dealer firms, custodians, nominees, and fiduciaries for their reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proxy solicitation will be borne by the Fund.��Officers, employees and agents of the Trust, AssetMark, and their affiliates may, without extra pay, conduct solicitations by telephone, telegram, telecopy, facsimile transmission, or other electronic media and personal interviews.��The
Trust expects that any solicitations will be primarily by mail, but also may include telephone, telegram, telecopy, facsimile transmission, or other electronic media or oral solicitations.
�



� 


10





� 



As the Meeting date approaches, you may receive a telephone call from a representative of AST if your votes have not yet been received.��Proxies that are obtained telephonically will be recorded in accordance with the procedures described below.��These procedures are designed to ensure that both the identity of the shareholder casting the vote and the voting instructions of the shareholder are accurately determined.
�
In all cases when a telephonic proxy is solicited, the AST representative is required to ask for each shareholder�s full name and address and to confirm that the shareholder has received the proxy materials in the mail.��If the shareholder is a corporation or other entity, the AST representative is required to ask for the person�s title and confirmation that the person is authorized to direct the voting of the shares.��If the information elicited matches the information previously provided to AST, then the AST representative has the responsibility to explain the voting process, read the Proposal listed on the proxy card, and ask for the shareholder�s instructions on the Proposal.��Although the AST representative is permitted to answer questions about the process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the shareholder how to vote, other than to read any recommendation
set forth in this Proxy Statement.��AST will record the shareholder�s instructions on the card.��Within 72 hours, the shareholder will be sent a letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the shareholder to call AST immediately if his or her instructions are not correctly reflected in the confirmation.
�
How do I Submit a Shareholder Proposal for Inclusion in the Trust�s Proxy Statement for a Future Shareholder Meeting?
�
The governing instruments of the Trust does not require that the Fund hold annual meetings of shareholders.��In the event that less than a majority of the Trustees holding office have been elected by shareholders, the Trustees then in office will call a shareholders� meeting for the election of Trustees.
�
The governing instruments of the Trust provide that a shareholder meeting may be called at any time by the Board or the president or secretary of the Trust for the purpose of taking action upon any matter requiring the vote or authority of shareholders or upon any other matter as to which such vote or authority is deemed necessary or desirable by the Board or the president.��A shareholder meeting may also be called for any purpose deemed necessary or desirable upon the proper written request of shareholders holding at least 10% of the outstanding shares of the Trust entitled to vote.
�
Shareholders of the Fund wishing to submit proposals for inclusion in a proxy statement for a shareholder meeting must send their written proposal to the Trust a reasonable time before the Board�s solicitation relating to that meeting is to be made.��Shareholder proposals must meet certain legal requirements established by the SEC, so there is no guarantee that a shareholder�s proposal will actually be included in the next proxy statement.��The persons named as proxies in future proxy materials of the Trust may exercise discretionary authority with respect to any shareholder proposal presented at any subsequent shareholder meeting if written notice of that proposal has not been received by the Fund within a reasonable period of time before the Board�s solicitation relating to that meeting is made.��Written proposals with regard to the Fund should be sent to the
Secretary of the Trust at 1655 Grant Street, 10th Floor, Concord, CA 94520.

�
(xi)�����������The Committee will review, as frequently as it deems necessary, the Board�s adherence to industry �best practices.�
�
(xii)�����������The Committee may develop, periodically review, and as appropriate recommend changes in, Board governance policies, procedures and practices concerning the structure, compensation and operations of the Board.
�
(xiii)�����������The Committee will review, as frequently as it deems necessary, the responsibilities of any committees of the Board, whether there is a continuing need for such a committee, whether there is a need for additional committees of the Board, and whether committees should be combined or reorganized.��The Committee will make recommendations for any such action for the full Board.
�

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
