	This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A is being filed to amend the Hecla Mining Company Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 (“Form 10-Q”), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2017, in order to correct data input errors contained under “Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the last full paragraph on page 46. That paragraph is amended and restated as follows (with changes appearing in the last three sentences only):




	 














	Original


	Disclosure





	 





	Amended and Restated


	Disclosure









	Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 increased by $19.6 million compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to working capital and other operating asset and liability changes which resulted in a net cash flow increase of $21.7 million in the first three months of 2017 compared to a net decrease in cash flows of $21.5 million in the 2016 period. The $0.2 million variance in working capital changes is attributed to lower accounts receivable due to the timing of sales at Greens Creek and Casa Berardi and higher payroll accruals due to the timing of payment of incentive compensation related to prior year performance. In addition, income, as adjusted for non-cash items, was higher by $19.5 million, due primarily to higher metals prices.




	 




	Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 increased by $19.6 million compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to working capital and other operating asset and liability changes which resulted in a net cash flow decrease of $7.4 million in the first three months of 2017 compared to a net decrease in cash flows of $21.5 million in the 2016 period. The $14.1 million variance in working capital changes is attributed to lower accounts receivable due to the timing of sales at Greens Creek and Casa Berardi and higher payroll accruals due to the timing of payment of incentive compensation related to prior year performance. In addition, income, as adjusted for non-cash items, was higher by $5.5 million, due primarily to higher metals prices.








	 




	Pursuant to Rule 12b-15 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we have repeated the entire text of Item 2 of the Form 10-Q in this Amendment, however, there have been no changes to the text of such item other than the changes described above and reflected in the paragraph under the heading “Amended and Restated Disclosure.”




	 




	This Amendment amends only the item of the Form 10-Q specified above and amends that item solely to reflect the changes described above.  This Amendment does not reflect events occurring after May 8, 2017.






	 







	Item 2.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations




	 





	Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q, including in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided for under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our forward-looking statements include our current expectations and projections about future results, performance, results of litigation, prospects and opportunities, including reserves and other mineralization. We have tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “intend,” “feel,” “plan,” “estimate,” “project,” “forecast” and similar expressions.  These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and are expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis.  However, our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.





	 





	These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part I, Item 1A – Business – Risk Factors in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Hecla Mining Company or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.  Except as required by federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

	Overview





	 




	Hecla Mining Company and our subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to the U.S. and worldwide since 1891. We discover, acquire, develop, and produce silver, gold, lead and zinc.




	 




	We produce lead, zinc and bulk concentrates, which we sell to custom smelters and brokers, and unrefined precipitate and bullion bars (doré) containing gold and silver, which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders.  We are organized into four segments that encompass our operating and development units:  Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian. The map below shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and pre-development projects, as well as our corporate offices located in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Vancouver, British Columbia.




	 






	 
Click to enlarge






	 




	Our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the following areas:




	 





	 




	•






	operating our properties safely, in an environmentally responsible manner, and cost-effectively;








	 




	•






	continue optimizing and improving operations at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian units;








	 




	•






	expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our operating properties;








	 




	•






	conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying metals price environments;








	 




	•






	advance permitting of the Rock Creek and Montanore projects. We acquired Rock Creek as part of the acquisition of Revett Mining Company, Inc. ("Revett") in June 2015, and we acquired Montanore through the acquisition of Mines Management, Inc. ("Mines Management") in September 2016;








	 




	•






	maintaining and investing in exploration and pre-development projects in the vicinities of six mining districts and projects we believe to be under-explored and under-invested: North Idaho's Silver Valley in the historic Coeur d'Alene Mining District; our Greens Creek unit on Alaska's Admiralty Island located near Juneau; the silver-producing district near Durango, Mexico; the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, Canada; the Rock Creek and Montanore projects in northwestern Montana; and the Creede district of Southwestern Colorado; and








	 




	•






	continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining properties and companies.







	 




	 


	3




	 




	 


	 




	A number of key factors may impact the execution of our strategy, including regulatory issues and metals prices. Metals prices can be very volatile. As discussed in the

	Critical Accounting Estimates

	section below, metals prices are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control. Average market prices of silver, gold, lead, and zinc in the first three months of 2017 were higher than their levels from the comparable period last year, as illustrated by the table in

	Results of Operations

	below. While we believe current global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand for the metals we produce, prices have been volatile and there can be no assurance that current prices will continue.




	 




	The total principal amount of our Senior Notes due May 1, 2021 is $506.5 million and they bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year. The net proceeds from the Senior Notes were primarily used for the acquisition of Aurizon in June 2013 (see

	Note 9

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	).


	As discussed in the

	Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources

	section below, we believe that we will be able to meet the obligations associated with the Senior Notes; however, a number of factors could impact our ability to meet the debt obligations and fund our other projects.




	 




	On June 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Revett, giving us 100% ownership of the Rock Creek project, a significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit in northwestern Montana. In addition, on September 13, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Mines Management, giving us 100% ownership of the Montanore project, another significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit located approximately 10 miles from our Rock Creek project. Development of Rock Creek and Montanore has been challenged by conservation groups at various times, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permitting required to develop these project

	s.

	In

	Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors

	in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, see

	Legal challenges could prevent the Rock Creek or Montanore projects from ever being developed

	for more information.




	 




	As further discussed in the

	Lucky Friday Segment

	section below, the union employees at Lucky Friday have been on strike since March 13, 2017, and production at Lucky Friday has been suspended since that time. We cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached. As a result of the strike or other related events, operations at Lucky Friday could continue to be disrupted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	 




	During the third quarter of 2015, we made a development decision to mine near surface, high grade portions of silver and gold deposits at our San Sebastian project in Mexico. Ore production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 and has continued since that time.  In addition, work began in the first quarter of 2017 to develop and rehabilitate underground access which would allow us to mine deeper portions of the deposits at San Sebastian. See the

	San Sebastian Segment

	section below for more information. We have generated positive cash flows at San Sebastian since the start of production there, and we believe that will continue through 2018.  However, our ability to generate positive cash flows at San Sebastian may be impacted by changes in estimated costs, precious metals prices, or other factors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and operate San Sebastian as anticipated.




	 




	We strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance. We seek to implement this goal by: training employees in safe work practices; establishing, following and improving safety standards; investigating accidents, incidents and losses to avoid recurrence; involving employees in the establishment of safety standards; and participating in the National Mining Association's

	CORESafety

	program. We attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness. We work with the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") to address issues outlined in its investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our safety practices.




	 




	Another challenge for us is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities. As described in

	Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors

	of our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and

	Note 4

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited),

	it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities (and our ability to estimate liabilities in general) may change in the future, affecting our strategic plans.  We are involved in various environmental legal matters and the estimate of our environmental liabilities, liquidity needs, or strategic plans may be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may arise. We strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and attempt to resolve environmental litigation on as favorable terms as possible.

	For the first quarter of 2017, we recorded income applicable to common stockholders of $26.7 million ($0.07 per basic common share), compared to a loss of $0.8 million ($0.00 per basic common share) during the first quarter of 2016. The following factors contributed to the results for the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016:




	 





	 




	•










	An income tax benefit of $29.1 million


	in first quarter of 2017 compared to an income tax provision of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The benefit in the 2017 period is primarily the result of a change in income tax position relating to the timing of deduction for #4 Shaft development costs at Lucky Friday, as further discussed in

	Corporate Matters

	below.








	 




	•

	Average realized prices differ from average market prices primarily because concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement, which differ from average market prices.  Due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with customers, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled.  Previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement.  For the first quarter of 2017, we recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $0.6 million compared to net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were largely offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period. See

	Note 11

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	for more information.  The gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc.  Realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal (which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the forward contracts discussed above) by the payable quantities of each metal included in concentrate and doré shipped during the period.

	A net foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $2.3 million versus a net loss of $8.2 million in the same period of 2016, with the variance primarily related to the impact of smaller decreases in the CAD-to-USD exchange rate on the remeasurement of our net monetary liabilities in Quebec. During the first quarter of 2017, the applicable CAD-to-USD exchange rate decreased from 1.3426 to 1.3310, compared to a decrease in the rate from 1.4006 to 1.2987 during the first quarter of 2016.

	Exploration and pre-development expense increased by $2.4 million


	in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. In 2017, we have continued exploration work at our Greens Creek, San Sebastian, and Casa Berardi units, and at our other projects in Quebec, Canada. "Pre-development expense" is defined as costs incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production, such as underground ramp development, which are expensed due to the lack of proven and probable reserves. Pre-development expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 was related to advancement of our Montanore and Rock Creek projects.

	The $5.8 million increase in gross profit during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same 2016 period was the result of higher average prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead, impacting sales by approximately $14.4 million. These factors were partially offset by lower sales volume due to the timing of shipments, and decreased ore production, grades and mill recoveries. In addition, gross profit at Greens Creek was impacted by positive price adjustments to revenues of $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to positive price adjustments of $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2016. Price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period.  The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in concentrate shipments were net of gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period. The price adjustments and gains and losses on forward contracts discussed above are included in sales.




	 




	Mining costs per ton increased by 7% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of higher labor cost, due to higher staffing levels, higher fuel and power costs, and lower milled tons. Milling costs per ton increased 9% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to lower tons milled and higher power and reagents costs, partially offset by lower labor costs. The increase in cost of hydroelectric power is the result of a price increase per kilowatt-hour purchased from $0.10 to $0.16 in September 2016.

	The decrease in Cash Costs, After By-Product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 was the result of higher by-product credits, partially offset by lower silver production. The decrease in AISC, After By-Product Credits, per Silver Ounce was due to the same factors impacting Cash Costs, After By-Product Credits, per Silver Ounce, along with lower capital and exploration spending.




	 




	 


	8




	 




	 




	Mining and milling costs per ounce increased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 on a per-ounce basis due primarily to lower silver production resulting from lower silver grades and ore throughput.




	 




	Other cash costs per ounce for the first quarter of 2017 were higher compared to 2016 due to the effect of lower silver production.




	 




	Treatment costs were higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower silver production and higher silver prices, as treatment costs include the value of silver not payable to us through the smelting process. The silver not payable to us is either recovered by the smelters through further processing or ultimately not recovered and included in the smelters’ waste material.




	 




	By-product credits per ounce were higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher gold, zinc and lead prices and lower silver production.     




	 




	The difference between what we report as “production” and “payable metal quantities sold” is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts.  Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold.  The difference in payable quantities sold for 2017 compared to 2016 is due mainly to timing of concentrate shipments.




	 




	While revenue from zinc, lead and gold by-products is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the Greens Creek unit is appropriate because:




	 





	 




	•






	silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future;








	 




	•






	we have historically presented Greens Creek as a producer primarily of silver, based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production, and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year;








	 




	•






	metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery;








	 




	•






	the Greens Creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver; and








	 




	•






	in most of its working areas, Greens Creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery.







	 




	Likewise, we believe the identification of gold, lead and zinc as by-product credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we have not consistently received sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product.




	 




	We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate.  Because we consider zinc, lead and gold to be by-products of our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.

	Gross profit increased by $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016. The variance is primarily due to higher silver, lead, and zinc prices, partially offset by reduced metal production as a result of the suspension of operations starting in mid-March 2017 due to a strike by unionized employees, discussed further below. Silver and lead production was also impacted by lower ore grades.





	 





	Mining and milling cost per ton increased by 7% and 16%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due primarily to lower ore production as a result of the strike described below.

	The decrease in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 was the result of higher by-product credits due to higher lead and zinc prices, partially offset by lower silver production. The decrease in AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce is due to the same factors impacting Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce, along with lower capital costs primarily as a result of completion of the #4 Shaft project in January 2017.




	 




	Similar to the Greens Creek segment, the difference between what we report as “production” and “payable metal quantities sold” is due essentially to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts.





	 



	 


	11




	 




	 




	While value from lead and zinc is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the Lucky Friday unit is appropriate because:




	 





	 




	•






	silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future;








	 




	•






	the Lucky Friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production; and








	 




	•






	the Lucky Friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production.







	 




	Likewise, we believe the identification of lead and zinc as by-product credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product.




	 




	We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate.  Because we consider zinc and lead to be by-products of our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.




	 




	Many of the employees at our Lucky Friday unit are represented by a union, and the most recent collective bargaining agreement with the union expired on April 30, 2016. On February 19, 2017, the unionized employees voted against our contract offer. On March 13, 2017, the unionized employees went on strike, and have been on strike since that time. Production at the Lucky Friday has been suspended since start of the strike. Costs related to care-and-maintenance of the mine during the strike period are reported in a separate line item on our condensed consolidated statement of operations and totaled $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. These care-and-maintenance costs are excluded from the calculation of gross profit, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce. We cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached. As a result of the strike or other related events, operations at Lucky Friday could continue to be disrupted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

	Gross profit decreased by $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to increased costs, mainly resulting from the additional costs related to the East Mine Crown Pillar ("EMCP") pit, including ongoing stripping costs, and lower ore grades, partially offset by higher gold prices and ore production. Processing of ore from the EMCP pit began in July 2016, resulting in increased ore volume, but at a lower grade.




	 




	Mining and milling cost per ton for the first quarter of 2017 were lower than the first quarter of 2016 by 1% and 9%, respectively, primarily due to higher ore production. This was partially offset by foreign exchange differences, as the U.S. dollar was weaker relative to the Canadian dollar in the first quarter of 2017 than it was in the first quarter of 2016.

	The increase in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 was primarily the result of higher costs as a result of addition of production from the EMCP pit, partially offset by higher gold production. The decrease in AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce was due to lower capital spending and higher gold production, partially offset by higher production costs.




	 




	The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities sold" is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined metals and shipping schedules.




	 




	We believe the identification of silver as a by-product credit is appropriate at Casa Berardi because of its lower economic value compared to gold and due to the fact that gold is the primary product we intend to produce there. In addition, we do not receive sufficient revenue from silver at Casa Berardi to warrant classification of such as a co-product. Because we consider silver to be a by-product of our gold production at Casa Berardi, the value of silver offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce.

	The $0.7 million decrease in gross profit in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 is primarily due to lower silver and gold production as a result of lower ore grades, partially offset by higher ore throughput. The ore processed in the first quarter of 2016 had considerably higher grades than anticipated over the mine life. The impact of lower metals production was partially offset by higher average silver and gold prices.

	The slight decrease in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 was primarily the result of higher by-product credits per ounce due to higher gold prices and the impact of lower silver production, partially offset by lower gold production, and lower mining costs as a result of reduced mining of waste. The increase in AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce was the result of higher exploration and capital spending, partially offset by higher by-product credits per ounce.




	 




	The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities sold" is mainly attributable to inventory changes incidental to the timing of sales of refined metals and shipping schedules.




	 




	We believe the identification of gold as a by-product credit is appropriate at San Sebastian because of its anticipated lower economic value compared to silver over the life of the mine. In addition, we will not receive sufficient revenue from gold at San Sebastian to warrant classification of such as a co-product. Because we consider gold to be a by-product of our silver production at San Sebastian, the value of gold offsets operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce. In addition to the impact of the by-product credits from gold, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce at San Sebastian are lower compared to our other operations due to the orebody being near surface and having higher precious metal grades, resulting in a lower Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.

	In the first quarter of 2017, we began construction of a new underground ramp and rehabilitation of the historical underground access. Once completed, these underground accesses should allow us to mine deeper portions of the deposits at San Sebastian, and we anticipate underground ore production to begin in late 2017. Capital costs related to the underground development are expected to total approximately $5.0 million.




	 






	 








	Corporate Matters






	 







	Employee Benefit Plans





	 




	Our defined benefit pension plans, while affording a significant benefit to our employees, also represent a significant liability to us. The liability recorded for the funded status of our plans was $46.9 million and $44.9 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In April 2017, we contributed $1.2 million in cash to our defined benefits plans, and expect to contribute an additional $2.8 million in cash or shares of our common stock to our defined benefit plans in 2017. While the economic variables which will determine future funding requirements are uncertain, we expect contributions to continue to be required in future years under current plan provisions, and we periodically examine the plans for affordability and competitiveness. See

	Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	for more information.




	 







	Income Taxes






	 





	Each reporting period we assess our deferred tax assets utilizing long-range forecasts to provide reasonable assurance that they will be realized through future earnings.  We continue to have a net deferred tax asset in the U.S. and a net deferred tax liability in Canada.




	 




	Our U.S. net deferred tax asset at March 31, 2017 totaled $48.4 million, or 2% of total assets, an increase of $12.6 million from the $35.8 million net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2016. The largest component of the deferred tax asset is net operating loss carryforwards. The next largest component is deferred foreign exchange losses. We have previously determined that we are an indefinite AMT taxpayer, resulting in additional valuation allowance primarily related to forecasted utilization of regular net operating loss carryforwards and the effect of re-measuring temporary deferred tax assets using a tax rate of 20% which differed from the previous rate of 35%. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined that we are eligible to take a different income tax position relating to the timing of deductions for #4 Shaft development costs at Lucky Friday. We filed with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") a request for approval to use this method, which was approved in the first quarter of 2017. The change resulted in additional deductions of approximately $203 million and $110 million for regular tax and AMT, respectively, resulting in a current tax benefit of approximately $10.7 million for the reduction in 2016 AMT payable. In addition, this change in tax position substantially changes the timing of additional deductions for these costs for regular tax and AMT relative to our projected life of mine and projected taxable income. These timing changes caused us to change our assessment of the ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, resulting in a valuation allowance decrease and deferred tax benefit of approximately $15.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2017, we retained a valuation allowance on U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $78 million, primarily for net operating loss carryforwards.




	 




	Our net Canadian deferred tax liability at March 31, 2017 was $121.0 million, a decrease of $1.9 million from the $122.9 million net deferred tax liability at December 31, 2016. The deferred tax liability is primarily related to the excess of the carrying value of the mineral resource assets over the tax bases of those assets for Canadian tax reporting.




	 




	We had no Mexican deferred tax asset or liability at March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. We expect to have unremitted earnings in Mexico by the end 2017; however, we anticipate being able to fully offset any U.S. tax impact of repatriating any Mexican earnings with foreign tax credits that are available to use for both regular tax and AMT. Accordingly, we estimate the net U.S. income tax impact of unremitted earnings to be zero. A $3.6 million valuation allowance remains on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions.

	Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP)






	to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost ("AISC"), Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP)








	 






	The tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, AISC, Before By-product Credits and AISC, After By-product Credits for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, San Sebastian and Casa Berardi units and for the Company for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 




	Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. We have recently started reporting AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce which we use as a measure of our mines' net cash flow after costs for exploration, pre-development, reclamation, and sustaining capital. This is similar to the Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce non-GAAP measure we report, but also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver mining company, we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare our performance with that of other primary silver mining companies. With regard to Casa Berardi, we use Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines. Similarly, these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.




	 




	Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and AISC, Before By-product Credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC, Before By-product Credits for each mine also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense, exploration and sustaining capital projects. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price, received from production. We also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that these non-GAAP measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies.




	 




	The Casa Berardi section below reports Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the production of gold, its primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi unit is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash




	Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined silver properties.

	Cash and cash equivalents increased by $7.0 million in the first three months of 2017, as discussed below. Cash held in foreign currencies represents balances in Canadian dollars and Mexican pesos, with the $10.9 million increase in the first quarter of 2017 resulting primarily from an increase in Mexican pesos held. Current marketable debt securities increased by $7.4 million (discussed below), and the value of non-current marketable equity securities increased by $0.1 million (see

	Note 2

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	for more information).




	 




	As discussed in



	Note 9

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited),

	on April 12, 2013, we completed an offering of Senior Notes in the total principal amount of US$500 million, which have a total principal balance of $506.5 million as of March 31, 2017

	.

	The Senior Notes are due May 1, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year from the most recent payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for.  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2013, and we have made all interest payments payable to date.




	 




	In the third quarter of 2015, we made a development decision to mine near surface, high grade portions of the silver and gold deposits at our San Sebastian project in Mexico and commenced ore production at the end of 2015.  As a result, San Sebastian has generated positive cash flows since the start of production there. In January 2017, we initiated work to develop and rehabilitate underground access which, upon completion, would allow us to mine deeper portions of the deposits at San Sebastian. We anticipate San Sebastian will continue to generate positive cash flows in 2017 and 2018.  However, our estimate of costs could change, and our ability to generate cash flow at San Sebastian could be impacted by changes in precious metals prices or other factors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and operate San Sebastian as anticipated.




	 




	As further discussed in the

	Lucky Friday Segment

	section above, the union employees at Lucky Friday have been on strike since March 13, 2017, and production at Lucky Friday has been suspended since that time. We cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached. As a result of the strike or other related events, operations at Lucky Friday could continue to be disrupted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	 




	As discussed in

	Note 8

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	, in February 2016 we entered into an equity distribution agreement under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time having an aggregate offering price of up to $75 million, with the net proceeds available for general corporate purposes. Whether or not we engage in sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including share price, our cash resources, customary black-out restrictions, and whether we have any material inside information, and the agreement can be terminated by us at any time. As of March 31, 2017, we had sold 2,780,087 shares through the at-the-market program for net proceeds of $8.1 million.




	 




	Pursuant to our common stock dividend policy described in

	Note 8

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	, our Board of Directors declared and paid dividends on common stock totaling $1.0 million in the first quarter of each of 2017 and 2016. On May 4, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend on common stock totaling $1.0 million payable in June 2017. Our dividend policy has a silver-price-linked component which ties the amount of declared common stock dividends to our realized silver price for the preceding quarter. Another component of our common stock dividend policy anticipates paying an annual minimum dividend. The declaration and payment of dividends on common stock is at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare and pay common stock dividends in the future.




	 




	 


	21




	 




	 


	 




	On May 8, 2012, we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program.  Under the program, we are authorized to repurchase up to 20 million shares of our outstanding common stock from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions and other factors.  The repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued by us at any time. Whether or not we engage in repurchases from time to time may depend on a variety of factors, including not only price and cash resources, but customary black-out restrictions, whether we have any material inside information, limitations on share repurchases or cash usage that may be imposed by our credit agreement or in connection with issuances of securities, alternative uses for cash, applicable law, and other investment opportunities from time to time.


	As of March 31, 2017, 934,100 shares have been purchased in prior periods at an average price of $3.99 per share, leaving 19.1 million shares that may yet be purchased under the program. The closing price of our common stock at May 4, 2017, was $5.14 per share.




	 




	We may defer some capital investment and/or exploration and pre-development activities, engage in asset sales or secure additional capital if necessary to maintain liquidity. We also may pursue additional acquisition opportunities, which could require additional equity issuances or other forms of financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us.




	 




	As a result of our current cash balances, the performance of our current and expected operations, current metals prices, proceeds from potential at-the-market sales of common stock, and full availability of our $100 million revolving credit facility, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, investments, projected cash from operations, and availability of financing (including equity issuances), if needed, will be adequate to meet our obligations and other potential cash requirements during the next 12 months. Our obligations and other uses of cash may include, but are not limited to: debt service obligations related to the Senior Notes, capital expenditures at our operations, potential acquisitions of other mining companies or properties, regulatory matters, litigation, potential repurchases of our common stock under the program described above, and payment of dividends on common stock, if declared by our board of directors.  Capital expenditures are closely tied to operations, and because mining at Lucky Friday has halted due to the strike and we cannot predict how long the strike will last, we currently do not have an estimate of capital expenditures for the full year of 2017. We incurred $21.7 million in capital expenditures in the first three months of March 31, 2017.  We estimate that exploration and pre-development expenditures will total between $25 million and $30 million in 2017, including $5.8 million already incurred as of March 31, 2017. However, capital, exploration, and pre-development expenditures may change based upon our financial position, metals prices, and other considerations. Our ability to fund the activities described above will depend on our operating performance, metals prices, our ability to estimate costs, sources of liquidity available to us, and other factors. A sustained downturn in metals prices or significant increase in operational or capital costs, other uses of cash, or other factors beyond our control could impact our plans.

	Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 increased by $19.6 million compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to working capital and other operating asset and liability changes which resulted in a net cash flow decrease of $7.4 million in the first three months of 2017 compared to a net decrease in cash flows of $21.5 million in the 2016 period.   The $14.1 million variance in working capital changes is attributed to lower accounts receivable due to the timing of sales at Greens Creek and Casa Berardi and higher payroll accruals due to the timing of payment of incentive compensation related to prior year performance. In addition, income, as adjusted for non-cash items, was higher by $5.5 million, due primarily to higher metals prices.

	During the first quarter of 2017 we invested $21.7 million in capital expenditures, not including $1.8 million in capital lease additions, compared to $34.7 million in the same period in 2016, with the variance primarily due to lower costs for the #4 Shaft project, which was completed in January 2017.  During the first quarter of 2017, we purchased bonds having a cost basis of $11.1 million and maturities of greater than 90 days and less than 365 days. Bonds valued at $3.6 million matured during the first quarter of 2017. We incurred an increase in restricted cash of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2016 related to the settlement of response costs at the Gilt Edge site by CoCa Mines, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary.

We made repayments on our capital leases of $1.6 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016. In the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, we also made repayments of debt totaling $0.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In addition, during the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, we acquired treasury shares for $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, as the result of employees' elections to satisfy their tax withholding obligations related to incentive compensation paid in stock through net share settlement. See

	Includes scheduled capital lease payments of $3.4 million, $4.7 million, and $4.2 million (including interest), respectively, for equipment at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and Casa Berardi units.  These leases have fixed payment terms and contain bargain purchase options at the end of the lease periods (see

	We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business.  Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time.  Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property.  Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements.

	We sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all U.S. employees and provide certain post-retirement benefits for qualifying retired employees, along with a supplemental executive retirement plan. These amounts represent our estimate of the future funding requirements for these plans.  We believe we will have funding requirements related to our defined benefit plans beyond one year; however, such obligations are not fixed in nature and are difficult to estimate, as they involve significant assumptions.

	On April 12, 2013, we completed an offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes due May 1, 2021. The Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year from the date of original issuance or from the most recent payment date to which interest has been paid or provided for.  Interest on the Senior Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing November 1, 2013, and we have made all interest payments payable to date. Since the initial offering, we have issued an additional $6.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to fund obligations under our defined benefit pension plan. See

	Note 9

	of

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

	for more information.







	 




	We record liabilities for costs associated with mine closure, reclamation of land and other environmental matters.  At March 31, 2017, our liabilities for these matters totaled $86.8 million. Future expenditures related to closure, reclamation and environmental expenditures at our sites are difficult to estimate, although we anticipate we will incur expenditures relating to these obligations over the next 30 years. For additional information relating to our environmental obligations, see

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements






	 






	At March 31, 2017, we had no existing off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC regulations, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	Critical Accounting Estimates






	 




	Our significant accounting policies are described in

	Note 1

	of

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

	in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016

	.

	As described in

	Note 1

	of the annual report, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic, political, regulatory, and other factors that affect our business prospects. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.




	 




	We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices; obligations for environmental, reclamation, and closure matters; mineral reserves; and accounting for business combinations, as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed to be critical. However, changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements.




	 





	Future Metals Prices





	 




	Metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities, including properties, plants and equipment, deferred tax assets, and certain accounts receivable. Metals prices are also an important component in the estimation of reserves.  As shown under

	Item 1A. - Risk Factors

	in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, metals prices have historically been volatile. Silver demand arises from investment demand, particularly in exchange-traded funds, industrial demand, and consumer demand. Gold demand arises primarily from investment and consumer demand.  Investment demand for silver and gold is influenced by various factors, including:  the value of the U.S. Dollar and other currencies, changing U.S. budget deficits, widening availability of exchange-traded funds, interest rate levels, the health of credit markets, and inflationary expectations.  Uncertainty related to the political environment in the U.S., Britain's exit from the European Union and a global economic recovery, including recent uncertainty in China, could result in continued investment demand for precious metals.  Industrial demand for silver is closely linked to world Gross Domestic Product growth and industrial fabrication levels, as it is difficult to substitute for silver in industrial fabrication.  Consumer demand is driven significantly by demand for jewelry and other retail products. We believe that long-term industrial and economic trends, including urbanization and growth of the middle class in countries such as China and India, will result in continued consumer demand for silver and gold and industrial demand for silver.  However, China has recently experienced a lower rate of economic growth which could continue in the near term. There can be no assurance whether these trends will continue or how they will impact prices of the metals we produce. In the past, we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices, and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase. 




	 




	Processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analysis of asset carrying values, depreciation, reserves, and deferred income taxes. On at least an annual basis - and more frequently if circumstances warrant - we examine our depreciation rates, reserve estimates, and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. We examine the carrying values of our assets as changes in facts and circumstances warrant.  In our evaluation of carrying values and deferred taxes, we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model, including current prices, analyst price estimates, forward-curve prices, and historical prices (see

	Mineral Reserves

	, below, regarding prices used for reserve estimates). Using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets, we use the probability-weighted average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated, and to determine the level of valuation allowances, if any, on our deferred tax assets.  In addition, estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions (see

	Business Combinations

	below).




	 




	 Sales of concentrates sold directly to customers are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer (generally at the time of shipment) at estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement. Due to the time elapsed between the time of shipment of concentrates to the customer and final settlement with the customer, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the customer. Changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment.  As a result, our trade accounts receivable balances related to concentrate sales are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs.  For more information, see part N. Revenue Recognition of

	Note 1

	of

	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

	in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

	We utilize financially-settled forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead.  See

	below for more information on our contract programs.  These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore marked-to-market through earnings each period.  Changes in silver, gold, zinc and lead prices between the dates that the contracts are entered into and their settlements will result in changes to the fair value asset or liability associated with the contracts, with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in earnings.




	 





	Obligations for Environmental, Reclamation and Closure Matters





	 




	Accrued reclamation and closure costs can represent a significant and variable liability on our balance sheet. We have estimated our liabilities under appropriate accounting guidance, and on at least an annual basis - and more frequently if warranted - management reviews our liabilities with our Audit Committee. However, the ranges of liability could exceed the liabilities recognized. If substantial damages were awarded, claims were settled, or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals, our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected.




	 





	Mineral Reserves





	 




	Critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves. Our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices, as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade, accessibility and production cost. Metals prices are estimated at long-term averages, as described in

	Item 2. - Property Descriptions

	in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually, and periodically utilizes external audits.




	 




	Reserves are a key component in the valuation of our properties, plants and equipment. Reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units-of-production depreciation, with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves. Reserves are also a key component in forecasts, with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values in an effort to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately. Our forecasts are also used in determining the level of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets. Reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for acquisitions. Annual reserve estimates are also used to determine conversions of mineral assets beyond the known reserve resulting from business combinations to depreciable reserves, in periods subsequent to the business combinations (see

	Business Combinations

	below).  Reserves are a culmination of many estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals or that we will do so at a profitable level.




	 





	Business Combinations





	 




	We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.  The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to long-lived assets (including mineral assets beyond the known reserve); these include estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves, as discussed above.  Management may also be required to make estimates related to the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation for business combinations. In some cases, we use third-party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and other identifiable assets. In addition, costs related to business combinations are included in earnings as incurred, and our financial results for periods in which business combinations are pursued could be adversely affected as a result.

	HECLA REPORTS 3.4 MILLION OUNCES OF SILVER AND






	56,113 OUNCES OF GOLD PRODUCTION






	Cash and Cash-Like Cash Investments Now $213 Million; a $14 Million Increase Over Year-End





	 




	 




	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE




	April 20, 2017




	 




	COEUR D'ALENE, IDAHO -- Hecla Mining Company (

	NYSE:HL



	) today announced preliminary production, operating costs and cash balance for the first quarter of 2017.¹





	 






	FIRST QUARTER 2017


	HIGHLIGHTS


	(Preliminary Results)





	 





	 




	●










	Silver production of 3.4 million ounces; gold production of 56,113 ounces.







	 





	 




	●
















	Silver equivalent production of 10.6 million ounces or gold equivalent production of almost 151,000 ounces


	.



	2








	 





	 




	●










	Lead production of 8,636 tons; zinc production of 15,537 tons.







	 





	 




	●


















	Cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (


	“


	cost of sales


	”


	) of $107.6 million, an increase over 2016 reflecting open pit production from Casa Berardi.







	 





	 




	●












	Silver cash cost, after by-product credits, per ounce of $0.84, the lowest in over five years and below our full year estimate of $2.75.

	3








	 





	 




	●












	Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $213 million at March 31, 2017, an increase of about $14 million for the quarter compared to a $21 million decline in the first quarter, 2016


	.







	 




	 




	“The first quarter production at Greens Creek and San Sebastian exceeded our expectations, more than offsetting the shortfall at Lucky Friday due to a strike by the union workers,”


	said Phillips S. Baker, Jr., President and CEO. “While our cost of sales increased over last year due to the higher throughput from the Casa Berardi open pit operations, our cash cost, after by-product credits, declined 73% over the first quarter 2016 to $0.84 per silver ounce. This strong operating performance allowed us to add $14 million of cash since the end of the year, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of increasing cash balances.”

	Greens Creek





	 




	At the Greens Creek mine, 1.9 million ounces of silver and 14,022 ounces of gold were produced in the first quarter, compared to 2.5 million ounces and 15,981 ounces, respectively, in the first quarter 2016. Lower silver and gold production was expected and principally due to lower grades than the prior period. The mill operated at an average of 2,190 tons per day (tpd) in the first quarter, in-line with the first quarter, 2016.




	 




	The cost of sales for the first quarter was $44.0 million, and the cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce, was $0.65, compared to $44.9 million and $3.96, respectively, for the first quarter 2016.

	5

	The per ounce silver costs were lower primarily due to higher base metals prices and fewer ounces of silver production.




	 





	Lucky Friday





	 




	At the Lucky Friday mine, 680,782 ounces of silver were produced in the first quarter, compared to 977,084 ounces in the prior year period. The decrease in silver production was due to the strike by the union workers since March 13


	.






	 




	The cost of sales for the first quarter was $14.5 million and the cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce was $5.93, compared to $18.5 million and $9.05, respectively, for the first quarter of 2016, with the decrease in cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce primarily due to higher base metals prices and fewer silver ounces produced.

	Casa Berardi





	 




	At the Casa Berardi mine, 35,807 ounces of gold were produced in the first quarter, including 7,157


	ounces from the East Mine Crown Pillar (EMCP) pit, compared to 30,378 ounces in the prior year period, primarily due to higher throughput. The mill operated at an average of 3,263 tpd in the first quarter, an increase of 37% over the first quarter 2016


	.




	 




	The cost of sales was $42.5 million for the first quarter and the cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce was $886, compared to $29.2 million and $781, respectively, in the prior year period, with the increase in cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce partly due to the expensing of stripping costs for the new EMCP pit.

	San Sebastian





	 




	At the San Sebastian mine, 750,803 ounces of silver and 6,284 ounces of gold were produced in the first quarter, compared to 1,200,339 ounces and 9,329 ounces in the prior year period. The lower silver and gold production was expected as the mine moved from East Francine to Middle and North veins, resulting in lower grades. The mill operated at an average of 407 tpd in the first quarter, an increase of 19% over the first quarter 2016.




	 




	The cost of sales was $6.6 million for the first quarter and the cash cost, after by-product credits, was negative $3.27 per silver ounce, compared to $7.7 million and negative $3.26, respectively, in the first quarter 2016.

	3







	The strong cash cost, after by-product credits, performance continues to be due to the silver grade, which, despite being lower than the prior period is still strong, as well as significant gold production, which is used as a by-product credit.




	 






	The Company has the mill leased for 2018 and expects to transition from open pit to underground mining by the end of 2017. The ramp is under construction to connect the new portal to the existing workings, which are also being rehabilitated. Recent definition drilling on the Middle Vein has shown better continuity of high-grade within reserve area, and exploration drilling continues to define new high grade material in the vicinity of the mine along the Middle and East Francine veins.

	NOTES





	 





	Non-GAAP Financial Measures






	 







	Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

	(2)

	Silver or gold equivalent production includes silver, gold, lead and zinc production from Lucky Friday, Greens Creek, San Sebastian and Casa Berardi converted using average realized prices for the quarter or year. Silver and gold equivalent calculations are based on the following prices: $17.42 for Ag, $ 1,219 for Au, $ 1.03 for Pb, and $ 1.26 for Zn.

	(3)

	Cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver and gold ounce represents a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (sometimes referred to as "cost of sales" in this release), can be found at the end of this release. It is an important operating statistic that management utilizes to measure each mine's operating performance. It also allows the benchmarking of performance of each mines versus those of our competitors.  As a primary silver mining company, management also uses the statistic on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare performance with that of other primary silver mining companies.  With regard to Casa Berardi, management uses cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines.  Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive compensation program.




	 





	(4)

	Cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce is only applicable to Casa Berardi production. Gold produced from Greens Creek and San Sebastian is treated as a by-product credit against the silver cash cost.

	The tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Ounce and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, San Sebastian and Casa Berardi units for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.




	 




	Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. It also allows us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver mining company, we also use the statistic on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare our performance with that of other primary silver mining companies. With regard to Casa Berardi, we use Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.




	 






	Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Ounce includes all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provides management and investors an indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price, received from production. We also use this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that our reporting of this non-GAAP measure is the same as that reported by other mining companies.




	 






	The Casa Berardi section below reports Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the production of gold, its primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi unit is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash




	Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined silver properties.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Certain statements contained in this Form 10-Q, including in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk, are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided for under Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our forward-looking statements include our current expectations and projections about future results, performance, results of litigation, prospects and opportunities, including reserves and other mineralization. We have tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "feel," "plan," "estimate," "project," "forecast" and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are based on information currently available to us and are expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.  These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part I, Item 1A - Business - Risk Factors in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Hecla Mining Company or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Except as required by federal securities laws, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Overview  Hecla Mining Company and our subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to the U.S. and worldwide since 1891. We discover, acquire, develop, and produce silver, gold, lead and zinc.  Table of Contents  We produce lead, zinc and bulk concentrates, which we sell to custom smelters and brokers, and unrefined precipitate and bullion bars (dore) containing gold and silver, which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders. We are organized into four segments that encompass our operating and development units: Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian. The map below shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and pre-development projects, as well as our corporate offices located in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Vancouver, British Columbia.  [[Image Removed]]  Our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the following areas:   operating our properties safely, in an environmentally responsible manner, and cost-effectively;   continue optimizing and improving operations at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian units;   expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our operating properties;   conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying metals price environments;   advance permitting of the Rock Creek and Montanore projects. We acquired Rock Creek as part of the acquisition of Revett Mining Company, Inc. ("Revett") in June 2015, and we acquired Montanore through the acquisition of Mines Management, Inc. ("Mines Management") in September 2016;   maintaining and investing in exploration and pre-development projects in the vicinities of six mining districts and projects we believe to be under-explored and under-invested: North Idaho's Silver Valley in the historic Coeur d'Alene Mining District; our Greens Creek unit on Alaska's Admiralty Island located near Juneau; the silver-producing district near Durango, Mexico; the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, Canada; the Rock Creek and Montanore projects in northwestern Montana; and the Creede district of Southwestern Colorado; and   continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining properties and companies.  A number of key factors may impact the execution of our strategy, including regulatory issues and metals prices. Metals prices can be very volatile. As discussed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section below, metals prices are influenced by a number of factors beyond our control. Average market prices of silver, gold, lead, and zinc in the first three months of 2017 were higher than their levels from the comparable period last year, as illustrated by the table in Results of Operations below. While we believe current global economic and industrial trends could result in continued demand for the metals we produce, prices have been volatile and there can be no assurance that current prices will continue.  Table of Contents  The total principal amount of our Senior Notes due May 1, 2021 is $506.5 million and they bear interest at a rate of 6.875% per year. The net proceeds from the Senior Notes were primarily used for the acquisition of Aurizon in June 2013 (see Note 9 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)). As discussed in the Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we believe that we will be able to meet the obligations associated with the Senior Notes; however, a number of factors could impact our ability to meet the debt obligations and fund our other projects.  On June 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Revett, giving us 100% ownership of the Rock Creek project, a significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit in northwestern Montana. In addition, on September 13, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Mines Management, giving us 100% ownership of the Montanore project, another significant undeveloped silver and copper deposit located approximately 10 miles from our Rock Creek project. Development of Rock Creek and Montanore has been challenged by conservation groups at various times, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the permitting required to develop these projects. In Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, see Legal challenges could prevent the Rock Creek or Montanore projects from ever being developed for more information.  As further discussed in the Lucky Friday Segment section below, the union employees at Lucky Friday have been on strike since March 13, 2017, and production at Lucky Friday has been suspended since that time. We cannot predict how long the strike will last or whether an agreement will be reached. As a result of the strike or other related events, operations at Lucky Friday could continue to be disrupted, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  During the third quarter of 2015, we made a development decision to mine near surface, high grade portions of silver and gold deposits at our San Sebastian project in Mexico. Ore production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2015 and has continued since that time. In addition, work began in the first quarter of 2017 to develop and rehabilitate underground access which would allow us to mine deeper portions of the deposits at San Sebastian. See the San Sebastian Segment section below for more information. We have generated positive cash flows at San Sebastian since the start of production there, and we believe that will continue through 2018. However, our ability to generate positive cash flows at San Sebastian may be impacted by changes in estimated costs, precious metals prices, or other factors, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and operate San Sebastian as anticipated.  We strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance. We seek to implement this goal by: training employees in safe work practices; establishing, following and improving safety standards; investigating accidents, incidents and losses to avoid recurrence; involving employees in the establishment of safety standards; and participating in the National Mining Association's CORESafety program. We attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness. We work with the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") to address issues outlined in its investigations and inspections and continue to evaluate our safety practices.  Another challenge for us is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities. As described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Note 4 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities (and our ability to estimate liabilities in general) may change in the future, affecting our strategic plans. We are involved in various environmental legal matters and the estimate of our environmental liabilities, liquidity needs, or strategic plans may be significantly impacted as a result of these matters or new matters that may arise. We strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and attempt to resolve environmental litigation on as favorable terms as possible.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations Sales of products by metal for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 Silver $ 51,357 $ 56,670 Gold 62,701 54,892 Lead 13,619 13,724 Zinc 29,865 22,525 Less: Smelter and refining charges (14,998 ) (16,794 ) Sales of products $ 142,544 $ 131,017  For the first quarter of 2017, we recorded income applicable to common stockholders of $26.7 million ($0.07 per basic common share), compared to a loss of $0.8 million ($0.00 per basic common share) during the first quarter of 2016. The following factors contributed to the results for the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016:   An income tax benefit of $29.1 million in first quarter of 2017 compared to an income tax provision of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The benefit in the 2017 period is primarily the result of a change in income tax position relating to the timing of deduction for #4 Shaft development costs at Lucky Friday, as further discussed in Corporate Matters below.   Higher average silver, gold, lead and zinc prices for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Silver - London PM Fix ($/ounce) $ 17.42 $ 14.84 Realized price per ounce $ 17.90 $ 14.93 Gold - London PM Fix ($/ounce) $ 1,219 $ 1,181 Realized price per ounce $ 1,221 $ 1,187 Lead - LME Final Cash Buyer ($/pound) $ 1.03 $ 0.79 Realized price per pound $ 1.06 $ 0.78 Zinc - LME Final Cash Buyer ($/pound) $ 1.26 $ 0.76 Realized price per pound $ 1.26 $ 0.79  Average realized prices differ from average market prices primarily because concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement, which differ from average market prices. Due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with customers, we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled. Previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement. For the first quarter of 2017, we recorded net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $0.6 million compared to net positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2016. The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments were largely offset by gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period. See Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information. The gains and losses on these contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for silver, gold, lead and zinc. Realized prices are calculated by dividing gross revenues for each metal (which include the price adjustments and gains and losses on the forward contracts discussed above) by the payable quantities of each metal included in concentrate and dore shipped during the period.   A net foreign exchange loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $2.3 million versus a net loss of $8.2 million in the same period of 2016, with the variance primarily related to the impact of smaller decreases in the CAD-to-USD exchange rate on the remeasurement of our net monetary liabilities in Quebec. During the first quarter of 2017, the applicable CAD-to-USD exchange rate decreased from 1.3426 to 1.3310, compared to a decrease in the rate from 1.4006 to 1.2987 during the first quarter of 2016.  Table of Contents   Increased gross profit at our Greens Creek and Lucky Friday units in the first quarter of 2017 of $5.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2016. This was partially offset by decreases in gross profit of $0.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017 at our Casa Berardi and San Sebastian units. See The Greens Creek Segment, The Lucky Friday Segment, The Casa Berardi Segment, and The San Sebastian Segment sections below.   Unrealized gains on investments of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to losses of $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. The losses in 2016 were the result of impairments of certain investments being deemed to be other-than-temporary.   Exploration and pre-development expense increased by $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. In 2017, we have continued exploration work at our Greens Creek, San Sebastian, and Casa Berardi units, and at our other projects in Quebec, Canada. "Pre-development expense" is defined as costs incurred in the exploration stage that may ultimately benefit production, such as underground ramp development, which are expensed due to the lack of proven and probable reserves. Pre-development expense of $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 was related to advancement of our Montanore and Rock Creek projects.   Higher interest expense by $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Interest expense in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 was net of $0.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in capitalized interest primarily related to the #4 Shaft project, with the decrease due to completion of #4 Shaft in January 2017.   A loss on base metal derivatives contracts of $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2017, with no net activity on base metal derivative contracts in the first quarter of 2016. See Note 11 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for more information.  Table of Contents  The Greens Creek Segment Dollars are in thousands (except per ounce and per ton amounts) Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Sales $ 58,850 $ 53,882 Cost of sales and other direct production costs (30,664 ) (31,252 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization (13,332 ) (13,601 ) Gross profit $ 14,854 $ 9,029 Tons of ore milled 197,129 204,968 Production: Silver (ounces) 1,929,297 2,458,276 Gold (ounces) 14,022 15,981 Zinc (tons) 13,406 14,611 Lead (tons) 4,809 5,087 Payable metal quantities sold: Silver (ounces) 1,439,461 1,901,143 Gold (ounces) 10,290 11,420 Zinc (tons) 10,159 12,412 Lead (tons) 2,830 3,244 Ore grades: Silver ounces per ton 12.71 15.17 Gold ounces per ton 0.10 0.11 Zinc percent 7.82 8.13 Lead percent 3.06 3.05 Mining cost per ton $ 71.41 $ 66.96 Milling cost per ton $ 33.72 $ 30.99 Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce (1) $ 0.65 $ 3.96 All-In Sustaining Cost ("AISC"), After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce (1) $ 3.86 $ 7.03  (1) A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found below in Reconciliation of Cost of Sales and Other Direct Production Costs and Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP).  The $5.8 million increase in gross profit during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same 2016 period was the result of higher average prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead, impacting sales by approximately $14.4 million. These factors were partially offset by lower sales volume due to the timing of shipments, and decreased ore production, grades and mill recoveries. In addition, gross profit at Greens Creek was impacted by positive price adjustments to revenues of $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to positive price adjustments of $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2016. Price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period. The price adjustments related to silver, gold, zinc and lead contained in concentrate shipments were net of gains and losses on forward contracts for those metals for each period. The price adjustments and gains and losses on forward contracts discussed above are included in sales.  Mining costs per ton increased by 7% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of higher labor cost, due to higher staffing levels, higher fuel and power costs, and lower milled tons. Milling costs per ton increased 9% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to lower tons milled and higher power and reagents costs, partially offset by lower labor costs. The increase in cost of hydroelectric power is the result of a price increase per kilowatt-hour purchased from $0.10 to $0.16 in September 2016.  Table of Contents  The chart below illustrates the factors contributing to the variances in Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016:  [[Image Removed]]  The following table summarizes the components of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce $ 24.71 $ 19.58 By-product credits (24.06 ) (15.62 ) Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce $ 0.65 $ 3.96  The following table summarizes the components of AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce:   Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 AISC, Before By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce $ 27.92 $ 22.65 By-product credits (24.06 ) (15.62 ) AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce $ 3.86 $ 7.03  The decrease in Cash Costs, After By-Product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 was the result of higher by-product credits, partially offset by lower silver production. The decrease in AISC, After By-Product Credits, per Silver Ounce was due to the same factors impacting Cash Costs, After By-Product Credits, per Silver Ounce, along with lower capital and exploration spending.  Table of Contents  Mining and milling costs per ounce increased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 on a per-ounce basis due primarily to lower silver production resulting from lower silver grades and ore throughput.  Other cash costs per ounce for the first quarter of 2017 were higher compared to 2016 due to the effect of lower silver production.  Treatment costs were higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of lower silver production and higher silver prices, as treatment costs include the value of silver not payable to us through the smelting process. The silver not payable to us is either recovered by the smelters through further processing or ultimately not recovered and included in the smelters' waste material.  By-product credits per ounce were higher in the first quarter of 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher gold, zinc and lead prices and lower silver production.  The difference between what we report as "production" and "payable metal quantities sold" is attributable to the difference between the quantities of metals contained in the concentrates we produce versus the portion of those metals actually paid for by our customers according to the terms of our sales contracts. Differences can also arise from inventory changes incidental to shipping schedules, or variances in ore grades which impact the amount of metals contained in concentrates produced and sold. The difference in payable quantities sold for 2017 compared to 2016 is due mainly to timing of concentrate shipments.  While revenue from zinc, lead and gold by-products is significant, we believe that identification of silver as the primary product of the Greens Creek unit is appropriate because:   silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future;   we have historically presented Greens Creek as a producer primarily of silver, based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production, and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year;   metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery;   the Greens Creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver; and   in most of its working areas, Greens Creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery.  Likewise, we believe the identification of gold, lead and zinc as by-product credits is appropriate because of their lower economic value compared to silver and due to the fact that silver is the primary product we intend to produce. In addition, we have not consistently received sufficient revenue from any single by-product metal to warrant classification of such as a co-product.  We periodically review our revenues to ensure that reporting of primary products and by-products is appropriate. Because we consider zinc, lead and gold to be by-products of our silver production, the values of these metals offset operating costs within our calculations of Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce.

Officer, Phillips S. Baker, Jr. “After considering all
investing and financing activities, we generated $178.9 million in
net cash flow last year. Our strong balance sheet and growing cash
flow should be sufficient to meet our financial obligations of a
potential Basin litigation settlement, as well as continuing to
fund capital projects to expand our operations and explore our
large land packages in the U.S. and Mexico.”

FINANCIAL
OVERVIEW

Hecla
reported 2010 and fourth quarter record revenues and cash flow from
operating activities, surpassing the previous 120-year record set
in 2009, as a result of increased tonnage at Lucky Friday and
Greens Creek, and higher metals prices. Net income applicable to
common shareholders for the full year and net loss applicable to
common shareholders for the fourth quarter were impacted by the
following three items:

·
    
An accrual
of $193.2 million in the fourth quarter 2010 due to an increase in
Hecla Limited’s estimated liability for environmental
obligations in Idaho’s Coeur d’Alene Basin caused by
historic mining activity. The increased accrual is based on a
potential settlement that includes all Basin claims in the
litigation. Hecla Limited’s accrual now stands at $262
million (see Coeur d’Alene Basin Litigation
below).

·
    
A change
in net income tax benefits, as a result of higher metals prices,
increased profitability, and the recognition of the tax effect of
the environmental liability accrual described above.

·
    
A $20.8
million loss, primarily non-cash in 2010 related to long-term base
metal hedging, which includes a loss of $9.6 million in the fourth
quarter 2010 due to rising base-metals prices, and mark-to-market
changes in the value of base metal derivative contracts. A summary
of the quantities of base metals committed at December 31, 2010 is
included at the end of this release.

Hecla’s
cash position at December 31, 2010 was $284 million, compared to
$105 million of cash on hand at December 31, 2009.

Capital
expenditures at our operations totaled $72.7 million for the full
year 2010 and $23.2 million for the fourth quarter. Full year
expenditures incurred at Lucky Friday were $54.4 million, which
included $15.8 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of the
expenditures at Lucky Friday were on the #4 Shaft Project. Full
year expenditures incurred at Greens Creek were $18.3 million,
which included $7.4 million for the fourth quarter.

Exploration
expenditures for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 were $5.4
million and $21.6 million, respectively. As detailed in the
exploration news release issued on February 24th, 2011, Hecla
achieved the highest level of silver reserves and resources in its
history with 142 million ounces and 248 million ounces,
respectively. Updated reserves and resources at December 31, 2010
also include gold reserves and resources of 757,000 ounces and
450,700 ounces, respectively; lead reserves and resources of
556,200 tons and 1.2 million tons, respectively; and zinc reserves
and resources of 859,000 tons and 831,900 tons,
respectively.

 

 


  


 

Coeur
d’Alene Basin Litigation

The
negotiators representing Hecla, the United States, the Coeur
d’Alene Indian Tribe, and the State of Idaho with respect to
the Coeur d’Alene Basin environmental litigation and related
claims have reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to
be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement that would contain
additional terms yet to be negotiated.

“Determining
the financial terms of any settlement of this longstanding
litigation is an important step forward in finally resolving this
dispute,” said Mr. Baker. “While the cost is
significant, we believe the terms are consistent with both our
current plans and adding opportunities that will allow Hecla to
grow further. We hope a final settlement can be achieved by the end
of the second quarter.”

On
February 18, 2011, the Idaho Federal District Court issued an Order
giving the parties to the litigation until April 15, 2011 to inform
the Court of the status of settlement negotiations. During this
time period, the negotiators will work towards finalizing and
agreeing to the settlement terms, followed by a recommendation for
approval to their respective parties. If the parties are able to
complete terms of settlement, it is expected that a Consent Decree
would be lodged, followed by a public comment period of 30 days and
a period for responses to those public comments. The Consent Decree
would also require approval by the Idaho Federal District Court. If
the Consent Decree is entered, Hecla would make the following
payments:

·
    
$102
million of cash and $55.5 million of cash or stock 30 days after
entry of the Consent Decree

·
    
$25
million of cash 30 days after the first anniversary of entry of the
Consent Decree

·
    
$15
million of cash 30 days after the second anniversary of entry of
the Consent Decree

·
    
$65.9
million by August 2014, as quarterly payments of the proceeds from
the exercise of any outstanding Series 1 and Series 3 warrants
(which have an exercise price of between $2.45 and $2.50 per share)
during the quarter, with the balance of the $65.9 million due in
August 2014 (regardless of the amount of warrants that have been
exercised)

While the
negotiators have reached an understanding on proposed financial
terms, no party has agreed to any of these terms as final, nor has
any party represented that any of these terms are final or agreed
to. There can be no assurance that a final settlement will be
reached.

Metals
Prices

Realized
metals prices increased significantly in 2010 compared to 2009. In
the fourth quarter and full year, realized metals prices exceeded
market prices primarily because of provisional price gains of $9.6
million in the fourth quarter and $16.6 million for the year due
largely to increased precious metals prices in the time period
between the shipment of concentrate and final
settlement.

OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW

In spite
of higher mine and mill throughput at both Greens Creek and Lucky
Friday, silver production decreased slightly in 2010 due to lower
silver ore grades at both operations, which was anticipated.
However, production of lead and zinc, which are important
by-products, increased to record levels in 2010 due to higher
grades and ore volumes. Fourth quarter silver production was higher
compared to a year ago mainly due to higher milled
tonnage.

The key
drivers for the reduction in total cash cost per ounce of silver
year-over-year are higher metals prices and increased production of
gold, lead and zinc. The increase in the fourth quarter total cash
cost per ounce of silver, in comparison to the same period in 2009,
is due to lower zinc and lead grades resulting in lower by-product
credits.

Greens
Creek

Full year
silver production at Greens Creek was 7.2 million ounces, which
included 1.9 million ounces in the fourth quarter, in comparison to
7.5 million ounces and 1.5 million ounces, respectively, in the
same periods in 2009. The decrease in silver production
year-over-year is due to lower silver ore grade. The lower silver
grade, along with the higher zinc and lead ore grades, were
expected and are due to differences in the sequencing of production
according to the mine plan. The increase in silver production in
the fourth quarter over the same period in 2009 is attributable to
higher silver, gold, lead and zinc grades and recoveries, and
increased mill throughput. The Company is working to optimize mill
capacity at Greens Creek and has successfully increased throughput
by approximately 10% since 2008 to 2200 tons per day, and will work
towards increasing throughput to 2250 tons per day in
2011.

Total cash
cost at Greens Creek for the full year was negative $3.90 per
ounce, net of by-products and was negative $1.93 per ounce for the
fourth quarter, net of by-product credits, compared to $0.35 and
negative $4.85 per ounce, respectively, for the same periods in
2009. The increase in total cash cost in the fourth quarter over
the same period in 2009 is due

Better Buy: Hecla Mining Co. vs. Royal Gold Inc.
Royal Gold has proven its mettle, and Hecla Mining's incredible recent rally deserves a closer look, too











                Neha Chamaria
            

                (Nehams)



            
            Apr 12, 2017 at 8:37AM
            
            





Investors looking for exposure to gold and silver can't possibly go wrong with stocks like Hecla Mining Co. (NYSE:HL)and Royal Gold (NASDAQ:RGLD). Both companies have rapidly climbed the ladder over the years to make it to the top of their sector: Today, Hecla is one of the leading silver producers in the U.S. while Royal Gold is among the world's largest precious metals streaming and royalty companies.
Hecla's stunning recent run up has left investors feeling rich -- the stock nearly doubled in just the past year. Royal Gold hasn't fared badly either, piling on as much as 39% in a year as of this writing. That gives both stocks a lead over their peers, making them compelling buys today. But let's take a dive deeper into the two companies and compare.
Mining vs streaming
First things first: It's important to understand the difference in the way Royal Gold and Hecla make money.

Image source: Getty Images

Hecla owns several mines across North America, but primarily operates out of three currently. With 172 million ounces of silver in proven and probable reserves, Hecla is only slightly behind Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) which had 176.6 million ounces in silver reserves as of the end of 2016. As you might've guessed, Hecla is in the traditional business of extracting precious metals.
Royal Gold, on the other hand, doesn't own mines; it enters into "streaming" agreements with miners under which it pays them cash up front to support their projects, and gets metal streams in return. Streaming companies usually are paying prices substantially below spot rates for those metals, making it a lucrative business. Royal Gold has partnered with some of the biggest miners, including Barrick Gold and Goldcorp, and boasts a portfolio comprising 38 operating and 22 developing mines.
Now that you have a fair idea about their different business models let's get straight to the point.
The case for Royal Gold
Royal Gold has several things going right for it. It closed its fiscal 2016 (which ended on June 30) with record revenue and strong operating cash flows, thanks to higher deliveries from mines like Centerra Gold's Mount Milligan and Barrick-Goldcorp's Pueblo Viejo. It reported 9% higher revenue, an 87% jump in earnings per share, and record operating cash flows during its last quarter, almost confirming it's on its way to another record year.
That's just going to make Royal Gold's operational track record look even better. It has grown its revenues and operating cash flows at compounded average rates of 29% and 25%, respectively, during the decade through fiscal 2016. Not surprisingly, it has rewarded shareholders with 16 consecutive years of dividend increases -- a record hard to match in a commoditized industry.
I'd credit management's approach to turning downturns into opportunities for Royal Gold's incredible performance. For example, management struck several streaming agreements in 2014 and 2015 which are now major contributors to the company's revenue, including Pueblo Viejo, Teck Resources' Andacollo mine, and Golden Star Resources' Wassa and Prestea mines. With the company having secured interests in 22 high-potential developing mines including Barrick's Pascua-Lama, investors needn't worry about the growth in Royal Gold's top line in coming years.





The case for Hecla Mining
Much like Royal Gold, Hecla is firing on all cylinders, with revenues hitting record highs in 2016 backed by record silver production. That's not all: Hecla swung to a big profit last year versus losses in 2015, and expects production to inch even higher this year, primarily because of grade upgrades. In the precious metals business, the higher the ore grade, the more valuable the mine.
Another fact worth knowing: Two of Hecla's operating mines featured among the world's 10 most valuable ore mines in a recent list released by InfoMine's IntelligenceMine, as reported by Mining.com. Not surprisingly, Hecla is also among the industry's lowest-cost producers, projecting its by-product all-in-sustaining cost (AISC) to be around $11.5 per silver ounce this year. That's substantially below Coeur's reported AISC of $14.27 per ounce of silver for 2016. Indeed, even Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS) -- the world's second-largest primary silver producer -- was dealing with AISC above the $14 mark until last year, when it brought down its costs dramatically to $10.17 per silver ounce.
Top-grade mines, low costs, rapidly growing production – there's not much more you can ask from a miner to make a strong investment thesis.
The final lap: Why Hecla wins
The match-up between these companies is incredibly tough, but my vote goes to Hecla for its solid asset base and standing in a highly competitive industry. Or, to put it another way: Income investors might prefer Royal Gold, and growth investors are more likely to go for Hecla. Neither side would want to ignore Hecla after looking at this chart, though.

HL Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) data by YCharts
Hecla is, hands down, a steal at current prices despite its recent run up.

Lucky Friday Mullan, Idaho



Lucky Friday is a deep underground silver, lead, and zinc mine located in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District in northern Idaho. The mine began operating in 1942 and is celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2017. Thanks to the #4 Shaft project which is now complete and operational, the mine is expected to have another 20-30 years of mine life. Lucky Friday is located one mile east of Mullan, Idaho, and is adjacent to U.S. Interstate 90.
The mine produced 3.6 million ounces of silver at a cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce of $8.89 (a non GAAP measure) (1). Production in 2017 is expected to be 3.6 to 4.1 million ounces of silver at a cash cost, after by-product credits, of $6.00 per ounce (1).
(1) Cash cost, after of by-product credits, per silver ounce represents a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (GAAP) can be found in the legal page of this website.

Overview & History
The Lucky Friday mine is a deep underground silver, lead, and zinc mine located in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District in northern Idaho. Hecla now controls 100% of the Gold Hunter deposit, also known as the Lucky Friday Expansion Area, after completing acquisition from Independence Lead Mines Company in the 4th quarter of 2008.
The mine is located approximately one mile east of Mullan, in Shoshone County, North Idaho, and 55 miles east of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, along Interstate 90 (I-90). The facility lies just north of the interstate near exit ramp 69. The Silver Shaft head frame can be easily observed from I-90 with the shaft collar approximately 70 feet above the valley floor. The Lucky Friday vein system is immediately adjacent to the Silver Shaft and the Gold Hunter deposit lies 5,000 feet northwest of the Silver Shaft.
In 2016, ore was processed at an average rate of 803 tons per day and produced 3.6 million ounces of silver.
The #4 Shaft Project, a key growth project, is now operational. Reaching 9,600 feet below the surface, the #4 Shaft is an important part of Lucky Friday’s future as it provides access to the highest-grade ore in the mine’s 75-year history and should extend the mine life for 20-30 more years. In 2017, the focus is on developing the 6500 level to connect the #4 Shaft to the orebody.
The plant has a full surface facility complete with a 1,000 tons of ore per day mill, which produces lead and zinc concentrates. These concentrates are currently shipped for treatment via truck to Teck Cominco Metals Ltd. smelter in Trail, BC, Canada. All production is by underground methods, which include both underhand and overhand mining. The coarse mill tailing is mixed with cement and used as backfill. Production is via ramps and transfers, and substantially utilizes jumbo drills, mechanized mining, and truck haulage to the Silver Shaft. Access to the underground workings is via the 18-foot diameter, concrete lined, Silver Shaft.

Geology & Mining
There have been two ore-bearing structures mined at the Lucky Friday unit. The first, mined through 2001, was the Lucky Friday vein, a fissure vein typical of many in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. The orebody is located in the Revett Formation, which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of orebodies in the Coeur d’Alene Mining District. The Lucky Friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet. Its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite. The ore occurs as a single continuous orebody in and along the Lucky Friday vein. The major part of the orebody has extended from the 1,200-foot level to and below the 6,020-foot level.
The second ore-bearing structure, known as the Lucky Friday Expansion Area, is located in the Wallace Formation. It has been mined since 1997 pursuant to an operating agreement with Silver Hunter Mining Company (“Silver Hunter”), our wholly owned subsidiary. During 1991, we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high-grade silver ores in an area known as the Gold Hunter property, approximately 5,000 feet northwest of the then existing Lucky Friday workings. This discovery led to the development of the Gold Hunter property on the 4900 level. On November 6, 2008, we, through Silver Hunter, completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Independence Lead Mines Company (“Independence”), including all future interest or royalty obligations to Independence and the mining claims pertaining to the operating agreement with Hecla Limited that was assigned to Silver Hunter.
The principal mining method at the Lucky Friday unit is ramp access, cut and fill. This method utilizes rubber-tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the orebody. Once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein, it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed, either above or below, from the ramp system.
There are three main phases to the mining process: development, production, and backfilling.
development – the tunneling or accessing phase
Using plans from the geology and engineering departments, miners drive tunnels 12ft high by 12ft wide to access the various ore zones to be mined.
production – the extraction phase
The method of extraction depends upon the geological nature of the orebody involved. Some of the narrower orebodies can be extracted using conventional mining methods (slushers and jackleg drills), mining as narrow as three feet. In other, more massive orebodies, mechanized mining methods are employed using large rubber-tired equipment to mine widths of up to 20 feet.
backfilling – the replacement phase
The voids created during the production phase are filled up with a combination of mill waste (tailings) and cement. This “backfilling” process stabilizes the production voids and allows extraction of the ore beside, above, and even below the backfilled area.

Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the SEC and included in the SEC’s Securities Act Industry Guide 7, entitled “Description of Property by Issuers Engaged or to be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations” (Guide 7). However, the Company is also a “reporting issuer” under Canadian securities laws, which require estimates of mineral resources and reserves to be prepared in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). NI 43-101 requires all disclosure of estimates of potential mineral resources and reserves to be disclosed in accordance with its requirements. Such Canadian information is being included here to satisfy the Company’s “public disclosure” obligations under Regulation FD of the SEC and to provide U.S. holders with ready access to information publicly available in Canada.
Reporting requirements in the United States for disclosure of mineral properties under Guide 7 and the requirements in Canada under NI 43-101 standards are substantially different. This website contains a summary of certain estimates of the Company, not only of proven and probable reserves within the meaning of Guide 7, which requires the preparation of a “final” or “bankable” feasibility study demonstrating the economic feasibility of mining and processing the mineralization using the three-year historical average price for any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and that the primary environmental analysis or report be filed with the appropriate governmental authority, but also of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates estimated in accordance with the definitional standards of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum referred to in NI 43-101. The terms “measured resources”, “indicated resources,” and “inferred resources” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101. These terms are not defined under Guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC in the United States, except where required to be disclosed by foreign law. The term “resource” does not equate to the term “reserve”. Under Guide 7, the material described herein as “indicated resources” and “measured resources” would be characterized as “mineralized material” and is permitted to be disclosed in tonnage and grade only, not ounces. The category of “inferred resources” is not recognized by Guide 7. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in such categories will ever be converted into proven or probable reserves. “Resources” have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of such a “resource” will ever be upgraded to a higher category or will ever be economically extracted. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a “resource” exists or is economically or legally mineable. Investors are also especially cautioned that the mere fact that such resources may be referred to in ounces of silver and/or gold, rather than in tons of mineralization and grades of silver and/or gold estimated per ton, is not an indication that such material will ever result in mined ore which is processed into commercial silver or gold.
2016 Reserves & Resources PDF
Exploration
At Lucky Friday, 293,870 tons were milled containing approximately 3.7 million ounces of silver during 2016.  Current reserve tons are 4% lower than last year and the contained silver ounces decreased by 1% to 77.8 million ounces.  The 2016 reductions to reserve tonnages at Lucky Friday are due to mining depletion and increased production costs.  Measured and indicated silver resources at Lucky Friday increased 4% from 2015 to a total of 133 million ounces.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, one drill was operating underground. Exploration drilling from the 635-52 Ramp Station West was designed to evaluate 30 Vein mineralization west of the second block of the Silver Fault which is the current western boundary of the resource. This drilling was progressively steeper and reached the 6500 sublevel elevation.  The shallower holes intersected three distinct veins with the deeper two holes only indicating a singular vein of significance. Vein interpretations have not been completed.
Future Plans
Our goal is to access more resource to further extend the mine life at Lucky Friday. Currently, we believe only one-third of the tons and one-half of the ounces that are contained underground at Lucky Friday are in the current mine life. Hecla sees great organic growth opportunities at Lucky Friday.
#4 Shaft
The #4 Shaft project, an internal shaft at the Lucky Friday mine, is now operational and expected to provide deeper access in order to increase the mine’s production and operational life. The #4 Shaft Project, a key growth project, reaches 9,600 feet below the surface, and is an important part of Lucky Friday’s future as it provides access to the highest-grade ore in the mine’s 75-year history and should extend the mine life for 20-30 more years. In 2017, the focus is on developing the 6500 level to connect the #4 Shaft to the orebody.
