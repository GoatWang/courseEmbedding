 Welcome to James!















James Capital Alliance, Inc. (JCA), a Registered Investment Advisor, is a related firm of James Investment Research (JIR).  JIR was founded in 1972 by Dr. Francis E. James, Jr., Ph.D.  James is located in Alpha, Ohio (just east of Dayton, Ohio).

James prides itself on its own research. The JIR proprietary model is a quantitative tool which uses over two hundred factors to screen and analyze a database of over 9000 stocks.

          The factors are generally value type factors, such as PE ratios, but relative strength and earnings momentum are also important. JIR's management encourages a creative approach to analysis, but a strict adherence to company standards and policies is required.
The Mission 
        Our team of professionals is committed to providing clients with peace of mind through time-proven research, premier service and consistently superior investment performance.
        We are dedicated to supporting and respecting one another and our community, which we believe will provide the rewards of continued growth and shared profitability.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
