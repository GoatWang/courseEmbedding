Hungry



by 
Dr. Robin L. Smith 

                                Books    











'Hungry  isn't about  the hunger for food, but the craving to reclaim and embrace our true  identity. It's not about making a plan or signing up for a program to  change our lives or relationships. It is about signing up to be a  witness to our own lives and journeys.' 
 
 In her latest book,  Hungry,   bestselling author Dr Robin L. Smith opens a window into her own  experience in order to help readers find new insight into their own.  Having battled emotional and spiritual starvation, Dr Robin understands  where our hunger comes from, deep down and how we can experience a  fullness of body, mind and spirit and reclaim our true selves. 
 
 Hungry   helps us get back in touch with our wants and needs and encourages us  to approach them, with compassion, tenderness, and hope. Dr Robin shows  us that what we're really hungry for is self-acceptance, love,  appreciation and the confidence and freedom to embrace the lives we  want in order to make our dreams a reality. Dr Robin lives  and teaches that a person can't succeed in living someone else's life;  they can only succeed in living their own life. That authenticity is the  only true way to harness inner peace. Being real, being yourself  full-time,  is what creates a rich, meaningful, and fulfilling life.

 Dr. Robin L. Smith, noted psychologist, ordained minister, motivational speaker, and best-selling author of  Lies at the Altar , seemed to have the perfect life, but underneath it all, she felt empty.
