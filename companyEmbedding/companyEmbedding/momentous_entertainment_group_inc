As Warren Buffet once said, if there are still a few puffs left on the cigar, pick it up and smoke it. That is one of his philosophies for finding under valued or passed over business opportuniites. While Momentous strives to produce the best in house projects in film and Music, we will also look to acquisition to enhance investor shareholder value.

Reality Television Projects

Bobby Dale Earnhardt: Chasing a Legacy
Momentous' Film & Television Division has signed a talent agreement with Bobby Earnhardt, Grandson of NASCAR Legend Dale Earnhardt, to produce a reality show. The show has been tentatively titled 'Chasing a Legacy. The show will chronicle the life of the grandson of NASCAR Legend and seven-time Sprint Cup Champion Earnhardt as he attempts to join his Grand Father and Uncle, 14 time Sprit Cup most popular driver Dale Earnhardt, Jr., as a top competitor in the upper echelons of professional stock car racing. The show will offer fans a never before seen look into the daily life of Bobby Earnhardt and stock car racing.

Update on the “Crossings” Music Projects


The Company has started work on its third album entitled, “Crossing – From Here to Eternity” which features singing artist Suzanne Olmon and a special appearance by Grammy award-winner singer, Cynthia Clawson. Momentous has made good progress in the fall 2016 on the work. Foundations tracks were recorded at Wire Road Studios on the first 6 songs. We hope to continue the production process sometime after the end of the first quarter of this year and be ready for an end of year release or New Year release. The work is being focused on the adult contemporary listening market to offer the broadest appeal possible and afford us the opportunity for radio airtime play, and being rated on platforms such as Nielson and Billboard charts. Our goal is to put in motion on the album release date, a marketing plan that will result in the album becoming both a Neilson 100 chart maker and a Billboard 100 chart maker. We will need to produce approximately 500 unit sales the week we release the new album to qualify for those chart toppers.
The first song on the album has been fully recorded and mixed. “A Baby Changes Everything” featuring Suzanne Olmon on vocals and musical arrangements of Howard Harris, Jr. The Recording was produced by Kurt E Neubauer, CEO of Momentous Entertainment Group. The song can be previewed on Momentous’ music website, Momentous Music Site Momentous Music Site 



 
Continued Growth by Acquisition

Momentous Entertainment Group’s management continues to review a number of possible acquisition targets that will grow the Company's revenues and provide steady long term growth. The Company plans to act on these potential acquisition targets throughout the remainder of 2017 and into 2018 to prepare and qualify for an up listing to either the NASDAQ or NYSE Markets..

Momentous Entertainment Group to Acquire Mobile Ad Network BLACKFOXHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets open in 4 hrs 10 minsS&P Futures2,475.50+1.50 (+0.06%)Dow Futures21,575.00+15.00 (+0.07%)Nasdaq Futures5,933.25-0.50 (-0.01%)Momentous Entertainment Group to Acquire Mobile Ad Network BLACKFOXMarketwiredApril 25, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Apr 25, 2017) - Momentous Entertainment Group, Inc. ("Momentous") (  OTCBB :  MMEG ), an online social media network company vertically organized into four business areas: social networking, social gaming, ecommerce sold consumer products and services, and OTT streaming media content creation and distribution, announced today that it has executed a Letter of Intent to acquire BLACKFOX.IO ("BLACKFOX").BLACKFOX.IO is a mobile advertising network with a strong worldwide affiliate network. BLACKFOX experienced explosive growth in 2015 through over a dozen premium and big-budget advertisers. BLACKFOX has a unqiue competitive advantage in that their customers only pay for performance for sucssesful installs or generated purchases. In addition, BLACKFOX clients are allowed to pay on credit terms (after a credit check).

PRE-DISPUTE, MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
GENERALLY
Arbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit. "Claim" means any dispute between you, MEG, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use (defined at here), your relationship with MEG, or these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use of the products, your attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by MEG or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, MEG, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. MEG agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against MEG. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right To go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.
EXCEPTIONS TO BINDING ARBITRATION
As an exception to binding arbitration, you and MEG both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. MEG will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court. Binding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.
MANDATORY PRE-DISPUTE PROCEDUTES
You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against MEG, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely. You may send the written description by U.S. Mail to Momentous Entertainment Group, Inc., P.O. Box 861, Sugar Land, TX 77487-0861; Attn: General Counsel. You agree to negotiate with MEG in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after MEG's receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.
COMMENCEMENT OF ARBITRATION
You and MEG agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.
ARBITRATION LOCATION
For your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in the federal district where you reside. It may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and MEG agree.
SPONSORING ORGANIZATION, RULES AND THE ARBITRATOR

The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or MEG.
ARBITRATION FEES
MEG shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party. The parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.
ARBITRATION AWARD
The arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law. The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it. Although MEG may have a right to an award of attorneys� fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, MEG agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator�s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law. Any award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.
ENFORCEABILITY
UThis provision survives termination of your account or relationship with MEG, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.
MISCELLANEOUS
Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and MEG and shall not be modified except in writing by MEG.
AMENDMENTS
MEG reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of any MEG Website, purchase of a MEG product, or use or attempted use of a MEG product, is affirmation of your consent to such changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, MEG will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of any MEG Website, purchase of a MEG product, or use or attempted use of a MEG product, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF A MEG PRODUCT ( WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO MOMENTOUS ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, INC., P.O. BOX 861, SUGAR LAND, TX 77487-0861; ATTN: GENERAL COUNSEL. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE IDENTIFYING ANY MEG PRODUCT YOU PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE WITHIN THE 30 DAYS AND THE DATE YOU FIRST PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE OF MEG PRODUCTS. UNTIMELY OPT-OUTS WILL NOT BE VALID AND YOU MUST THEN PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS.
EXCLUSIVE VENUE FOR OTHER CONTROVERSIES
You agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Agreement (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, or the United States District Court for the Central District of California, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.
REMEDIES FOR MEG
In order to avoid irreparable injury to MEG, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement, we shall be entitled to seek an injunction and/or other equitable relief restraining such breach. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting MEG from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of monetary damages from you.

	MOMENTOUS ENTERTAINMENT GROUP TO ACQUIRE ECOMMERCE RETAILER NEUROFUSE





	Nuerofuse to Provide Additional Domestic as well as Worldwide Revenue Streams to Momentous Entertainment Group






	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA,

	February 28, 2017  Momentous Entertainment Group, Inc. (Momentous) (OTCBB:MMEG), a diversified media company with a focus on technology that creates, produces and distributes quality content across various media platforms, announced today that it has executed a Letter of Intent to acquire NEUROFUSE (NEUROFUSE).





	Neurofuse https://www.neurofuse.com/focus/ is a unique ecommerce retailer that provides cutting edge, scientifically advanced nootropic supplements. The company develops unique formulations based on scientific studies that prove sufficient evidence to their effectiveness in focus, energy and memory retention. All products that they supply come from their contracted Federal Food & Drug Administration Inspected and approved multi-million dollar facilities. They are also all GMP certified, meaning: Good Manufacturing Practice, which assures that each and every time, customers receive the exact same potent, and effective product blends.





	In business for over two years, NEUROFUSE continues to thrive and has seen extraordinary growth since inception. Since June 2014, the company has sold to approximately 35,000 on-line customers. A great product and superb customer service have played a crucial role in allowing for approximately 40% of sales coming from repeat customers. The sale includes the website, (https://www.neurofuse.com/focus/), Facebook and Twitter domains, all NEUROFUSE trademarked brands and copyrights, all current customer accounts, merchant accounts, fulfillment, customer service facilities and existing inventory.





	Momentous CEO Kurt Neubauer stated, This brings a third acquisition to bear with Momentous and adds yet another revenue stream to manage. While some might not understand our business model, Momentous is utilizing both sides of the market equation, having subscribers, or customers and identifying and acquiring ecommerce that will appeal to our market base. These first acquisition targets have manifested quickly. We are continuing to work our acquisition model and expect to continue this process throughout the year. Mr. Neubauer also stated, we expect to close the NEUROFUSE acquisition by the first week of April 2017 after initial due diligence has been completed.

MEG will apply the proceeds from the offering for working capital, including
satisfaction of accrued expenses relating to our initial planning and
registration-related expenses and costs incurred for the preparation of
infomercials and commercials under the license agreement with PILOXING®. A
precise estimate of the breakdown is not possible since we cannot predict the
likelihood of being successful in deferring payments to creditors. However, it
is likely that the first $38,000 raised from this offering will be used to
satisfy expenses accrued during the offering process and the excess, if any,
will be used for some of the production/development expenses of the infomercials
needed for PILOXING® program. The amount collected in this Offering will not be
sufficient to cover more than a portion of the PILOXING® program.

The table below reflects the estimated breakdown of proceeds based on the
percentage of proceeds that are actually received:

                                               25%       50%       75%      100%  
     Offering related expenses              $ 38,000 $  38,000 $  38,000 $  38,000
     PILOXING® expenses and operating costs   15,375    70,750   125,125   179,500
                                            $ 53,375 $ 108,750 $ 163.125 $ 217,500

We believe that the project covered by the license signed in May 2014, PILOXING®
may start generating cash flow by the end of December 2014 or in early 2015.
However, we cannot give any assurances as to the likelihood or timing of being
able to do so. We cannot provide any assurances as to the likelihood or timing
of our success in these areas. In any event, Mr. Neubauer has provided us with
demand loans of $182,620 from his personal resources through June 30, 2014 and a
total of $255,820 through July 31, 2014 to complete the PILOXING® program. He
has verbally committed to continue to provide demand loans to us from personal
resources until the PILOXING® project has started to run commercials.
Thereafter, his personal situation will not enable him to provide any assurances
about further financial assistance or loans.

MEG will not undertake projects requiring cash outlays, other than direct
response marketing projects, until revenues commence.

Instruction 7 to Item 504 of Regulation S-K permits us to reserve the right to
change the use of proceeds, provided that such reservation is due to certain
contingencies. Our plans may be modified depending on the factors set forth in
the paragraph above. Our president has agreed to be responsible, separately from
agreeing to provide loans for working capital needs, for all legal costs
relating to the offering if these costs are not paid within six months of the
effective date of the Company’s Registration Statement of which this Prospectus
is a part provided that we have received a trading symbol and Depository Trust
Company approval for our shares.


The direct response marketing industry, which we will be emphasizing for at
least the next year to 18 months, includes numerous companies that market their
products on television through infomercials. These companies include including
GT Brands, Tri-Star Products, Telebrands, Idea Village, Guthy-Renker, Tilia (a
division of Jarden, Inc.), and Sylmark, all of which have significantly greater
resources and name recognition than do we. We plan on competing by seeking
smaller companies that we can serve in a personal and effective manner and will
take advantage of the contacts of the members of our Board of Directors.

The competition in the film industry ranges from major film production companies
to small independent film makers and distributors.

Most of these competitors have significantly more financial resources than do
we. Our principal method to compete is to utilize the knowledge, experience and
contacts of our management team. We cannot provide any assurances as to the
likelihood of our success in this regard.


Company Description
MEG was founded by Kurt E. Neubauer as Financial Equity Partners, Inc., a Texas
company, in 2004 and was incorporated as a C corporation under the laws of the
State of Nevada as Momentous Entertainment Group, Inc. in November 2013. We had
very limited activities until June 2011 when we started


 designing a detailed
business plan focused on:

· creating, producing and distributing quality entertainment content across
  various media channels including feature film, television, radio, the Internet,
  as well as various forms of digital media for use in the home or on mobile
  devices; and

· utilizing direct response media marketing for our music and film products.

Direct response media and sales provide us with the potential of generating
ongoing revenue on a consistent and relatively low risk basis. Our films, if and
when started, will be family and faith-based productions. Our music will be
similar in content.

In 2011 and 2012 we worked on the production of a movie with Champion
Entertainment, an entity affiliated with our president at the time. Ultimately
there were issues involving funding and the movie was not released. All costs
have been written off. Our share of costs was loaned by our president and are
reflected in the account, Accounts Payable to President on our Balance Sheet.

To help undertake our efforts in a potentially effective way, in December 2013
we entered into a joint venture with Dixie Worldwide Productions, Inc. (“DWP”)
which is a producer, developer, marketer and distributor of film, video news
releases, commercials, infomercials and sellers of consumer products through
Direct Response Television. We will assist DWP in selecting consumer products to
include in direct response marketing, design advertising and develop films and
videos. DWP has several contractual arrangements which have the potential for
developing or carrying out the first few joint projects, including a production
service agreement which will be important for providing facilities to do the
initial filming/production work for our projects.

MEG along with DWP has a combined management and marketing sales staff with over
150 years of collective experience in identifying, producing, marketing and
selling film and music entertainment and consumer products. The three officers
of MEG, Messrs. Neubauer, Pepe and Williams, each have 30 or more years of
experience.
