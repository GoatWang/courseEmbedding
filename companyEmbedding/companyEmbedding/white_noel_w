Step¬†1
Slightly bend handle on both picks and arrange picks down into the grapevine wreath. Place one pick along the bottom of the wreath and the second along the left side. Space the picks 8‚Äù apart.¬†Use two 8"¬†lengths of floral wire to wire the picks onto the wreath, if needed, for added stability.¬†Cut the large poinsettias and two small poinsettias, a pine cone and all sprigs of flowers from the floral bush using floral cutters. Leave at least 2-3" on each stem to attach to the wreath. ¬†
Step¬†2
Place a line of hot glue onto the stem of the large poinsettia. Place the flower down into the wreath between the two picks. Flank the remaining two small poinsettias on each side of the large poinsettia.¬†Place a line of hot glue onto each remaining flower and pine cone and place each element down into the wreath as desired to fill gaps.¬†Fluff as needed.¬†Share your project photos with #MakeItWithMichaels ¬†

White Label Product









Share








































What is a 'White Label Product'
A white label product is manufactured by one company and packaged and sold by other companies under various brand names. The end product appears as though it has been manufactured by the marketer. The benefit for the manufacturer and the marketer is that the manufacturer can concentrate on making the product or service and focus on cost savings, and the marketer can invest in marketing and selling the product.

      
BREAKING DOWN 'White Label Product'
      Businesses large and small use white label products and services to expand their offerings and increase revenue. White label products are easily spotted on store shelves, as they are the products retailers sell with their own brand attached, commonly known as the store brand. The products sometimes are sold at a discount relative to other well-known brands.Some online businesses without the resources to invest in the infrastructure, technology or personnel to create products and services use white labels to launch successful brands. Companies that produce white label products and services sometimes grow larger than the business that buy from them, due to the volume they produce for various retailers. The use of white label products and services is considered a form of outsourcing.White Label ProductsElectronics companies often sell generic white label products under their own brands. Typical white label products include radios, DVD players, computer mice and keyboards, and TV remote controls. Major electronics brands that invest in technology to design and manufacture higher-end products, such as high-end mobile phones and computers, often put their brand names on cheaper-priced white label electronics to expand their offerings. This is why some consumers may notice that two DVD players sold under different brands, for example, are exactly the same.Supermarkets and big-box retail stores also sell numerous white label products featuring their own branding. Whole Foods Inc.'s 365 products and Costco Wholesale Corporation's Kirkland products are examples of store branding on white label products.White Label ServicesBusinesses, such as banks, use white label services such as credit card processing when they do not have such services in house. Some businesses, that have no banking operations offer branded credit cards to their customers; this is also considered to be a form of white labeling. For example, L.L. Bean Inc. offers its consumers a branded credit card; the card is actually provided by Barclays Bank Delaware. Macy‚Äôs also offers its consumers a branded card; the card is actually provided by American Express.

Overview



 How the Irish Became White traces the tattered history of Irish and African-American relations, revealing how the Irish used unions, the Catholic Church and the Democratic party to help  secure their newly found place in the White Republic. Ignatiev explores andchallenges the Irish tradition of labor protest and the Irish role in the wave of anti-Negro violence that swept the country in the 1830s and 1840s. In addition, How The Irish Became White provides a provocative recounting of the roles of northeastern urban politicians in the Irish triumph over nativism, which allowed for their entry into the "white race."

I Something in the AirII White Negroes and Smoked Irish III The Transubstantiation of an Irish Revolutionary IV They Swung Their Picks V The Tumultuous Republic VI From Protestant Ascendancy to White Republic Afterword  Squarely in the intellectual tradition of C.L.R. James, and extending and building upon the work of Alexander Saxton and David Roediger, Noel Ignatiev has produced that rare work of historical scholarship that while firmly grounded in past events, also speaks forcefully to current concerns. Well done Brother Ignatiev (Professor John Bracey, W.E.B. Du Bois Department of Afro-American Studies, University of Massachusetts, Amherst) written with verve and imagination. Unquestionably, a tour de force (Herbert Hill, Evjue-Bascom Professor of African-American Studies and Professor of Industrial Relations, University of Wisconsin-Madison)
