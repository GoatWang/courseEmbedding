Good morning. My name is Robert, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Granite Construction Investor Relations fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. Please note, we will take one question and one follow-up question from each participant.
It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Granite Construction Director of Investor Relations, Ron Botoff. Sir, the floor is yours.
Ronald Botoff - Director - Investor Relations
Welcome to the Granite Construction, Incorporated fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. I'm here today with our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Roberts; and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Laurel Krzeminski.
We begin today with an overview of the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from the statements made today. Please refer to Granite's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of risk factors that could affect these projections and assumptions. The company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Certain non-GAAP measures may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the company's executives. And please note that a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures is included as part of our earnings press release. For more information, visit our Investor Relations website at investor.graniteconstruction.com. Thank you.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Granite Construction, Incorporated Chief Executive Officer, Jim Roberts.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Ron. And good morning, everyone. It is with great pleasure today that I have the privilege to speak with you about our improved performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. It is a great pleasure today that I congratulate and thank Granite teams across the country for delivering improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. And it is with great pleasure today that I thank Congress for finally doing their job in December and passing the first long-term federal highway bill in the decade, the FAST Act.
But before I comment on public funding trends and the requisite opportunities and challenges they present, let's start today by discussing the successes and challenges in our business. 2015 was a successful year and it is reflected in our results. Certainly the market has improved, but our teams are working more safely and efficiently, and it is paying dividends.
Let's dive into the business, beginning with Construction Materials. In 2013, we suggested that the materials business was the leading indicator for our vertically integrated business. Two years later, quarterly segment profit margin has improved in six of the past seven quarters and annual gross profit margin more than tripled from about 3% in 2013 to more than 11% in 2015.

While pricing has increased over the past couple of years, the majority of materials improvement is related to higher volumes. Notably, volume has a long way to go to reach the previous peak production levels we experienced 8 years to 10 years ago. But perhaps most importantly, this business is continuing on a path of improved quality, efficiency, cost savings and a renewed customer focus. These important recurring efforts are enabling this portion of our business to continue on its path of steady profitable growth.
Despite a continued environment of lukewarm public spending trends for at least the past five years, Construction segment margins have traveled a similar path as Materials, nearly doubling from about 8.5% in 2013 to a very respectable level of about 15% in 2015. In fact the fourth quarter of 2015 marks the seventh consecutive quarter and the 10th quarter out of the past 12 quarters with year-over-year gross margin improvement in the segment. We are pleased but not satisfied with this recovery.
Certain markets in the West and strong contributions from our power and underground businesses helped segment profitability nearly double at 20% in the quarter. This standout performance was key to our results in the fourth quarter.
Construction markets have recovered from the bottom, but bidding remains highly competitive across geographies and across end markets. Once again, our success in Construction follows a similar path as in Materials.
As we executed the past few years on our strategic plan, the relentless focus on safety, execution, diversification and continuous improvement all contributed to our results. Importantly, we continue to work to improve pricing which unfortunately tends to move north more slowly than when it moves south. Our leaders are committed to increasing prices in all areas of our business.
Throughout local markets, opportunities in power, underground and continuing strength in the overall commercial market are combining to fuel improved gross margins. Increased focus and attention in these areas the past few years is yielding results contributing strongly to top and bottom line growth in the Construction segment even in the tepid public spending environments of the past few years.
Now moving to the Large Project segment. Business performance improved in the second half of 2015 after a challenging start to the year. In the first half of 2015, weather and project challenges, some within our control and some not, ultimately left us well short of the project progress we had anticipated for the year.
Granite teams across the country continue to execute on more than $2 billion of segment backlog, as our bidding activity continues to pay dividends with recent wins on the Loop 202 South Mountain Freeway in Phoenix and the Alabama I-59, I-20 Interchange in Birmingham. These projects are expected to contribute more than $400 million to segment backlog in the first quarter.
The Tappan Zee Bridge, the IH-35E in Texas, the I-4 Ultimate in Florida, and the Pennsylvania Rapid Bridge Replacement continue to represent the majority of segment revenue. At the end of 2015, only the Tappan Zee and IH-35E projects have reached the halfway point of completion. With early stage jobs still comprising the majority of segment revenue, we continue to expect margins to remain lower than when they mature through the project lifecycle over the next few years.
Unfortunately, a number of projects nearing completion performed below expectations, which also contributed to weaker than expected performance in 2015. As projects mature and as we are able to mitigate risks, both project and segment profitability should improve. While we expect improvement in 2016 from the segment gross profit margin we posted in 2015, we believe it will be 2017 before the project portfolio mix again can produce margins in the mid-teens range, our long-term project expectation.

It is always difficult to pinpoint specific timing, but we're confident that we are managing appropriately to improve performance in our Large Projects business. Challenging and sometimes unprofitable projects occur, and even in the past decade, our project portfolio has produced quite variable results especially on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Over that time, our Large Project portfolio has delivered returns in line with our expectations in the mid-teens.
Now turning to the business of winning new business. We bid on more than $5 billion of large projects in the fourth quarter, with successes in Arizona and Alabama representing more than $1.1 billion of project value for Granite teams, a hit rate in line with our segment expectations. These wins and our existing backlog allow us to be more selective in our upcoming bid list. In 2016, the lion's share of remaining bidding is in the back half of the year, but our list of prospects remains long. We expect to bid on more than $15 billion of large projects through the end of next year. This competitive market continues to produce robust and diverse bidding opportunities that allow Granite to better prioritize the work we want to bid, win and build.
Now let's shift for just a few minutes to the always-critical topic of public funding. Let's start with the good news from Washington, D.C.: the FAST Act is here. Remember, though, that this represents a starting point for Granite and for an industry that has been starved of consistent funding for many, many years. We do not expect a significant change to the near-term competitive environment, but we do expect the initial impact to show up for Granite in the second half of 2016 in the form of more bidding activity than we have seen in many years, which rapidly could change the capacity and pricing landscape. And we expect bidding activity to gain momentum especially in 2017, which should help accelerate additional growth.
But the FAST Act alone is not a panacea. Because while nearly two dozen states have taken action since 2012 to address transportation funding shortfall, little of these new funds have yet to reach the street. We believe that a change in focus and commitment is gaining momentum, but the disparity of commitment from state to state remains troubling. And many state and municipal entities have underinvested for so long that massive catch-ups remain a necessity.
Illustrating the stark differences in transportation funding trends from state to state are Texas and California. Last November, Texas voters approved Proposition 7, which is expected to provide an additional $3 billion a year for the Texas Department of Transportation in an annual transfer from the Texas general fund. And this is after voters approved a separate greater than $1 billion per year transportation funding ballot measure in 2014 called Proposition 1.
This critical commitment to investment unfortunately is offset by chronic inaction and inefficiency in California. California's system is at least bruised, if not broken. Even as state revenues have swelled again to record levels, transportation spending continues to decline. Across the state, the list of projects on the chopping block due to spending woes continues to grow and in the shadow of a budget surplus.
Gas taxes here are set and adjusted annually based on an arcane, revenue neutral system with a 2010 base. The result: The California Board of Equalization just this week approved a third consecutive annual reduction in gas taxes, this time $0.022 down to $0.278 from July of 2016 through June of 2017, a 30% reduction from $0.395 motorists paid in 2014. And it results in an estimated $328 million less to spend on transportation projects in California next fiscal year. For California today, it is hard to move forward when it is stuck in reverse. Please don't get me wrong. We remain extremely constructive about the coming opportunities here in California. Unfortunately, I am less confident now that action will be taken in the first half of this year than I was last fall when I presented to the California Legislature's Special Session conference. Governor Brown's $36 billion 10-year transportation funding enhancement plan remains on the table, as do a number of individually submitted bills, all of which are larger than the Governor's proposal. But the timing of any significant commitment in California remains uncertain.

I remain hopeful that 2016 can be the launch point for this critical investment. Over the past few years, we invested in becoming a stronger, smarter, more efficient company by looking inwardly to challenge ourselves to be better even in light of some extremely challenging market conditions, and we are not finished. We still have a long way to go to be satisfied that we are generating steady, growing operating and financial results. With last year's results in mind, we set our sights on improved performance in 2016 in an environment of steady but modest growth. However, we expect both company and industry growth to accelerate in 2017 and in 2018.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Laurel to discuss more details of our results and our 2016 outlook. Laurel?
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter 2015 revenue was $630.2 million, up 6.8% from last year, with fiscal year 2015 revenue increasing 4.2% to about $2.4 billion. Earnings per share increased 68.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $0.72, up from $0.43 last year, and 2015 EPS more than doubled to $1.52 per share compared to $0.64 in 2014.
Total company 2015 gross profit margin was 16.2% in the fourth quarter, and we're particularly pleased with the more than 210 basis point margin improvement in 2015 to 12.8%. During the quarter and throughout 2015, improved results were driven by particular strength in the Construction and Construction Materials segments.
SG&A expenses increased in 2015 to $207.3 million, driven primarily by personnel-related costs. Contract backlog totaled $2.9 billion at the end of 2015, up 7% from $2.7 billion last year. Large Project Construction backlog increased about 2% year-over-year to more than $2 billion with Construction backlog increasing nearly 21% in 2015 to more than $860 million. And as Jim mentioned, this does not include our portion of the Arizona project, the Alabama project and additional business resulting from early season win rates tracking well ahead of the last couple of years.
Looking at the segment detail, fourth quarter Construction segment revenue increased more than 9% to $341.5 million with 2015 Construction revenue improving 6.4% to $1.3 billion. In the fourth quarter, segment gross profit margin improved more than 900 basis points year-over-year to 20%. In 2015, Construction gross profit margin improved more than 500 basis points to just over 15%, returning to what we would consider healthy level for the first time in many years. We are excited and encouraged by this performance.
Moving now to Large Project Construction, where segment revenues increased 4% in the quarter to $222.4 million and fiscal year 2015 revenues decreased 1.5% to $812.7 million. Fourth quarter segment margin declined about 560 basis points from last year to 11.6% with 2015 segment margin finishing at 9.8%, down about 320 basis points. 2015 performance reflects the timing of overall project portfolio progression coupled with execution issues on certain projects. Fourth quarter 2014 segment gross profit included initial profit recognition and dispute resolution of more than $25 million.
As Jim mentioned, we continue to target mid-teens margins over the life of projects and we do expect some improvement in 2016 from the gross margins we posted in 2015. But we expect it will be 2017 before we can again produce margins in the mid-teens range.
Fourth quarter 2015 Construction Materials segment revenue increased 5.5% year-over-year to $66.2 million. For a second straight year in 2015, Materials revenue increased double digits to nearly $296 million. Quarterly segment gross profit margin surged to 12%, up more than 660 basis points from last year. This was a strong contributor to the nearly 400 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement to 11.2% in 2015.

Revenue and profit growth was driven primarily by improved volumes, with aggregate pricing and production efficiency gains also contributing to the performance.
Finally, let's turn to our outlook and guidance. Last February, we suggested that revenue would grow mid-single digits and EBITDA margin would improve to finish in a range of 6% to 8%. We also suggested that our profitability would improve fairly in line with 2014. How did we do?
Revenue increased 4.2%, check; EBITDA margin increased 7.3%, check; gross profit improved more than $60 million for a second consecutive year with net income of more than $35 million in 2015 after improving nearly $30 million the year before, check.
2016 is on desk now with the benefit of the strong foundation we built with our solid 2015 performance. We entered 2016 with the balance of potential headwinds and tailwinds shaping our opportunities.
Certainly today's very real transportation funding issues in California contribute to the challenge of tepid public funding trends, but this is balanced with a potential late 2016 positive impact to market from the FAST Act. While we expect large project margins to remain below our long-term trends in 2016, we do this while executing on continued near record backlog of $2.9 billion. Of course we continue to expect to benefit from ongoing execution improvement and efficiency gains across our business, and our Materials business continues to strengthen.
In light of these factors, we currently expect mid-single-digit consolidated revenue growth in 2016, with EBITDA margin in a range of 6% to 8%. And quite pleasingly, growth acceleration in 2017 is now in our sight.
Now before we take your questions, let me turn the call back to Jim.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Laurel. Today, we are executing more effectively on the foundation we built and shaped during the difficult times of the past five years to leverage coming growth opportunities. As was a case at this time last year, we are focused on capturing and executing on broad opportunities across geographies and end markets. We will continue to emphasize strong cost control and strategic investment, as we build on consecutive years of improved operational and financial performance.
And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Our first question is from Mr. Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.
Brandon Jaffe - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks. This is actually Brandon Jaffe on behalf of Jerry. It's clear that you are positive on the long-term impact to the highway bill, but in the press release, you've made some cautionary comments about the near term. Can you just talk about what concerns you in the context of relatively healthy DoT budgets?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, You bet. My concern always any time any kind of a public spending bill gets passed is how quickly it can be put into place. And if you look at historically what a federal highway bill, it will take time to get that work typically put into play and bid and physically awarded to contractors and then you won't see the physical financial results of it until probably two quarters or three quarters later.
So when we give a little cautionary statement about the federal highway bill, it's mostly relative to the timing. And I state that the back half of the year is when we will see some positive results from it. We are already seeing the opportunity with some designs and things coming out to play, but it doesn't hit the financials to later in the year.
Brandon Jaffe - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thanks. And your Construction backlog is at pretty healthy levels entering 2016 which has usually been positive for the margin profile earlier in the year? How should we be thinking about the margins in that segment for 2016?

James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think that you are right. The backlog in Construction is quite a bit from the previous year and it's a mix which is really nice to see. It's not just DoT type work. We've expanded the businesses. The power business has a lot of work in the Construction segment. The underground business has a lot of work in that segment and we've actually expanded the Constriction segment into the private sector. Renewable energy is a big deal of the day and so is the commercial markets. Commercial markets are coming back.
So we expect in the long term, we've always said somewhere around 12% to 15%. We are very pleased with 15% last year. That is a healthy type of margin for our standard Construction segment. But I think you are right. What happens in these markets is that when there is a lot of backlog and people, I'll talk about competitors first, when they have a healthy backlog, then the pricing changes.
And I mentioned that in the script that it takes a saturation point in the market place to get pricing to change, and more backlog at the beginning of the year means that that pricing differential could occur in the second quarter, could occur in the third quarter, quite not sure yet but the same point is I think the mid-teens are very healthy margin in the Construction business.

The next questioner will be Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee. Go ahead.

Good morning, gentlemen, Laurel.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Mike.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.
Jim, to amplify on your California comment, so is that – obviously it seems like it changed from what your anticipation was second half of last year. Is there an actual frustration or is it just like pushed out timing where some of those moneys can get liberated to hit the street second half of this year and is that part of maybe the cautionary headwind discussion that you put through in your prepared remarks?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, when you mentioned Mike – when you mentioned frustration, the answer is yes and yes.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.
Okay. Sure.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So I was very hopeful last year that we had some serious momentum in California with the special session appointed by the Governor that they would act and get something done. And they had real momentum and then it died over the holidays. We are back on and we are moving very heavily in California to get a transportation bill that is somewhere between the Governor's minimal proposal of $3.6 billion up to proposals on the street today that are up to $7 billion annually. It's not a matter of if in California, it's a matter of when. And everybody knows that, it's just as always in politics, timing is very difficult to figure out.
But I do think, Mike, that we'll get something passed in 2016. Now whether or not, and I will call this the headwind, whether or not we get to see the value of it is questionable in 2016. That's why I mentioned an acceleration in 2017, because I think again whether it's the state or the fed, the states move a little faster than the feds, but it will still take a quarter to two quarters to get those projects out on the street, out to bid and in company's backlogs. So I am frustrated with the speed, but I am confident that we will get a large transportation bill in California.

Michael S. Dudas - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.
Turning to your Large Project business, it seems through the optimism is well placed and there is quite a bit of bidding opportunity for Granite and you've had some very early success during the last couple months. How are you looking to manage the timing and the opportunities in those businesses given where you are in the four that you are operating now and kind of rolling off project teams on one to another? Is it something that you can look to accelerate if things work out well and you get more wins or is there something you're going to be looking to really pick the ones where you can get the best margin not be so aggressive on the volume side?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it's a little bit of both. I think first – certainly I mentioned it in the script, Mike, that we want to be more selective, number one. And we want to make sure that the projects that we bid, win and build, provide the returns that we expect in that mid-teen range in Large Projects. But secondarily, we also know that we have to grow that part of the business, and we are promoting from within. We are putting our people on strategic positions and jobs so that they're capable to run bigger jobs down the road in the very near future. So it's a combination of both. That business has the opportunities to grow, but the key to success in that Large Projects business is a very methodical growth. I've seen many companies that get themselves in trouble by growing that business too fast and that would be a problem.
The other thing in that part of that business is that you have to team up with the right partners when you are on mega jobs, and that's really important to pick the right partners, the ones that work well with our company and the ones that have the same level of expectation that we do on those projects. So we are very comfortable that it's a market that's growing and our job is to just select the right projects, the right partners and demand the right kind of margins on those projects.

The next questioner is Mike Shlisky of Seaport Global. Please go ahead.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Good everybody.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Mike.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
I wanted to touch first on your (26:53) outlook for perhaps Construction Materials. Do you expect a rapid acceleration there in 2016 or is that also going to wait until perhaps 2017 to see the actual percent get a little higher there?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Well, the Materials business is and I mentioned it also in the script, it's kind of the leading indicator of what's going on in the economy. It kind of hits the first barrage of private sector involvement in the economy, and it's healthy and it's going to stay healthy. Now how fast it improves from where it is today, I think it's going to be very methodical again. I don't see an inflection point yet, because what you need to get an inflection point in the Materials business is both the private sector click in and the public sector click in. I actually think today the private sector has gained more momentum over the last couple of years than the public sector has.
But as I mentioned, Mike, when you start running into the end of this year and the public sector starts ticking in with the FAST Act and some of these state individual acts, then I think you're going to start seeing the Materials business move fairly quickly. And we've had years in that Materials business where we've been in the high-teen margins. As you can tell, now we're in the low-teen margins, so there is quite a ways of upward movements still to go, but it's going to take both the private and public sector in line at the same time to get there.

Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay, great. I also wanted to ask about your SG&A, Laurel has that, I missed it. But in the fourth quarter, it was the highest it has been in a bunch of years, looking back through history. Can you maybe just give us some more color as to what happened in the fourth quarter? And then secondly maybe like how that might be – how we should look at the 2016 run rate there? I'd appreciate that. Thanks.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Okay. The biggest driver of the increase in SG&A is personnel-related costs, primarily incentive comps and then the typical normal increase in salaries and burden. As far as how you should look at it, I would say at about the same percentage of revenue as we currently have. Our objective is to grow revenue without growing SG&A a lot. So we want to pull the percentage that we have and begin to work that down as we grow the top line.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC

The next question comes from Nick Coppola of Thompson Research. Go ahead.

Hi, good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Nick.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
So first question would be on the Construction segment. The 20% gross margin is obviously quite strong. Can you talk more about the drivers of that improvement, maybe help parse out for us.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think that as I mentioned a little bit, Nick, earlier, the private sector's driving that. There's just no doubt about it. The expansion in the commercial markets, the renewable markets, the underground markets with some private clients has really jumped up in the last 12 months. And so that's what's driving the big returns today, and that's what's going to drive the bigger returns down the road. The DoTs and the public sector markets are typically more commodity markets that drive lower GPMs. But I actually think that the private sector's growing nicely and although I wouldn't expect 20% every quarter, as I mentioned you get into the mid-teen margins in construction and you're doing a really nice job. So the Granite teams did a really nice job in 2015.
And I also think that our people are just doing a better job in the field. They're executing at a substantially higher level. We've enacted our continuous improvement program. And the people in Granite are just taking the execution issues to heart and they're just operating better than their competitors. And that does make a huge difference in a couple of points here and there in the construction business, and as you can see, when you can move up into a 20% margin, that means you're executing at a high level.
The other thing that happened in the West, which is where most of our construction work is, is there was a pretty mild winter through December. We didn't get a lot of rain. We got a lot of rain in January. But on the whole West Coast, we had nice weather, and they got to operate consistently through, say, mid-December, which makes it a nice fourth quarter, so that does help.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
All right. Well, that's great to see. And then second question here, can you talk more about what you're seeing in the state of Washington, particularly as a result of that 16-year bill that was done there?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Yeah. So remember what they did up there last year, they passed a 16-year – or a 10-year $16 billion bill – yeah, 16 and 16, that's right. So it was $1 billion a year. We are seeing releases already. One thing that will happen in a state like Washington, any of the Northern states that have a winter attached to them, what you'll see is a very competitive bidding environment in the first quarter. You'll see lots of work out to bid typically, and you'll see more bidders in the first quarter.
So I think it's yet to be determined, Nick, exactly how that $1 billion a year additional program will hit the street, how it will affect the bidding environment, but the Washington market is healthy. It's got a very strong private sector. It's very diversified from the East to the West. The Cascades lie in between. And I think you're going to see that continue to make it healthier, especially when the FAST Act ties in at the same time later on in the year. That's going to be a really nice addition to the Washington program, because as I mentioned before, I see the FAST Act starting to hit the streets in the third and fourth quarter of this year, and then you got the $1 billion a year program on the Wash DoT on top of that. I think you are going to see Washington do some really nice things.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC

The next question comes from Alex Rygiel of FBR. Go ahead.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Jim, could you talk a little bit more in depth with regards to the material sales business and where pricing is today relative to the past peak?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, sure, Alex. So the business is – we ought to break it, in Granite, into two components for our Materials business. First of all, the aggregates business, which is much easier to track because you have a very static number of inputs to it. You have aggregates you're extracting from the ground, and you are using a host of different methodologies to crush and make product. Those products have risen in pricing somewhere, I would say, 3% to 5% last year. We see similar type increases this year, maybe more, and it's a nice methodical market, and I like where it's going. I think that could have an inflection point later in the year again, if we start seeing the volume demand from both private and public hitting at the same time. We haven't seen that yet, but we have seen a healthy volume increase, about 10% year-to-year in that end of the market, which is healthy which, has helped the pricing.
Now the second part of the business is a very interesting part of the business, and that's the asphalt business. The asphalt business, as you would imagine, is driven heavily by crude pricing which liquid asphalt is a major component of asphalt, and it's the bottom of the barrel out of the refinery. And as those prices dropped tremendously over the last 18 months, so therefore has the pricing for asphalt. The key ingredient there is to be able to not price the asphalt with the full reduction in price of liquid and capture some upside in the gross profit margin, and our businesses have been able to do that, and I think they're going to continue to be able to do that.
That is a very healthy market as well, but what happens with the asphalt market is the big volume from that market is typically driven by public projects. You get very large, we'll call them asphalt overlays, and whether Granite does them or a third party, we really like to sell products in the very large arenas there so that we can get some fixed volumes out in our plants. So I think again in the Materials business and the asphalt business especially, once you see the public sector gearing up and you start seeing more of the surface work coming into play, I think you're going to see that part of the Materials business, the asphalt side, maybe reach an inflection point at the end of this year or beginning of next year.

Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Thanks. And Jim, you referenced that Granite's likely going to be bidding on something like $15 billion worth of large projects in 2016 and 2017. How does that number compare to maybe the past 24-month period?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's pretty much in line. It might be down a little bit, but what happens is that we have a whole bunch of them in the hopper that we haven't made our minds up on yet. So you could get one $3 billion project and go through what we call our large projects committee and get it approved, and then it would change, it would add $3 billion to that list. I would suggest this, Alex. It is robust. We're being very choosy, and we're turning opportunities away, and the amount of work that we're going to bid is going to be in line with what our capabilities are.
Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Very helpful. Thank you.

William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC
Good morning, gentlemen and Laurel.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC
So I want to add on the last couple of questions, Jim. Let's go to the pricing as well as your capacity and help us understand how you are bidding, trying to balance not overextending yourselves near term?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. That's an interesting question because that's what we used to chat about 10 years ago. Do we have a capacity issue, is there some saturation point in your business that you are going to not be able to do any more, and you are going to turn and walk away. And the key ingredient is exactly what you said is that you start optimizing your margin expectations long before you reach a saturation point so that you don't fill yourself up with lower margin work and then lose the opportunities in the higher margin work.
I'll tell you with the businesses that we have across the country, we have a huge opportunity to increase the amount of work we do in the Construction Materials segment. We are nowhere near capacity. But it is smart business to watch what goes on in the markets and not reach capacity too quickly, because what we have seen historically is that our competitors are smaller, they have less elasticity in their business, and they tend to fill up faster when the markets improve and then there is a significant change in the pricing and that's that inflection point.
So I don't see a capacity issue for Granite today. I think that it is a good business to continually move prices up, find out where that pressure point is. And I think we are going to be working that very hard over the next – in 2016.
William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC
Okay. Good color there. Thank you. My follow-up is overall on labor and hiring at this point. Are you seeing labor starting to tweak up here or due to the fallout of the shales, do you feel more in essence that it's contained?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I'll say it's both. You are getting some other industries. There is an influx of workers from the other industries. No doubt, the upstream oil industry has allowed some opportunities for those individuals to move into the construction segment which is good, but of course that's not in all geographic parts of the country.
The other thing that we've seen is that when we are on prevailing wage jobs which is a big chunk of our work, we typically are able to get craft workers because the wage rates that we are providing those craft workers is higher than the open shop or non-prevailing wage work in the same geographic market. I would suggest that there is an equal pressure point on talented professionals in the industry. And when you start obtaining large work and you need 30, 40 engineers, different types of capabilities, scheduling, quality, safety, the technical side of the professional business, I think, is going to be actually reach a saturation point before the craft level does.

So there is a duplicate of concerns but as long as you are willing to reward those people properly, I think those kind of companies are going to make it through this nice upward pick in the market. But if you are going to stay on the cheap side, you're going to have a problem obtaining and retaining people.
William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC
Okay. And one last one if I could just tweak it in. Texas had quite a bit of rainfall mid-November to the end of the year. Was there any impact to the projects that you are doing there? You are doing some material projects there.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, absolutely. Yeah, we are doing some big work in Dallas and it has affected – that's the IH-35 job. It has absolutely affected that job. We've had a big – we had a big wet year at the beginning of last year as well that had a significant negative effect in Texas. Then it dried out. We made huge progress, but I would say that that job – one job there in Dallas itself has been affected by rain over the last 12 months.

The next questioner will come from Sameer Rathod of Macquarie. Go ahead, sir.
Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I think in the past you guys have talked about a total sales funnel or total work outstanding that you guys see if I recall correctly it was like a $50 billion or $60 billion number. How is that number tracking? I know you've said $15 billion over the next year or so, but how is the total amount of work that you are seeing coming to market changing?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I would say, Sameer – by the way, good to hear from you. I'd say that it's pretty similar to where it's been. It may be not even getting bigger. The overall market size is growing. And the question obviously is when we give you a $60 billion number, those are things that are in our hopper that we are looking at and that we know are out there and that we are tracking. And it could be two or three years down the road before that actually comes into play and there are also times where the owner decides to go a different route, break the project up into smaller projects or they can't get the permits to actually build the work. But I don't see that changing. I actually see the amount of construction work growing. Thinking about the marketplace on construction that's the $75 million and less on the Granite portfolio side, I think that long-term outlook for work is actually growing quite a bit.
The other thing that's happening is that we are looking at a more diversified kind of pile of work out there in the U.S. So we are not just looking at a big transportation project anymore. We are looking at big power projects. We are looking at big water facilities. And as we expand our horizons and diversify, I think that what you're going to see is that pot and we can talk about this in the future, the size that overall long-term tracking is going to get bigger and bigger.
Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Right. Right. That's helpful. I guess my next question is on oil and gas. Obviously, you don't have any direct exposure, but you're in a stage that lot of the economy is based on oil and gas. Have you seen any kind of second or third order derivative from the decline in oil and gas on kind of how the public officials are thinking about infrastructure?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think that – yes and no. I think certainly the oil sector and the crude pricing has caused some revenue issues in certain states, and I mentioned in my remarks that the drop in crude and the Board of Equalization just dropped some significant gas tax requirements in the state of California, and you think about a state that we do have a nice business in that has been hit with the – because of the oil industry – is Alaska. That's a very focused state on oil and energy, and that has hit that state now. We've done quite well up there and we anticipate doing quite well, but certainly it puts struggles on states like that.

But it's interesting in the power market, we're actually seeing our power business having tremendous opportunities, by changing the transmission and distribution systems and looking at new power lines and decommissioning lines and expansion in right-away projects and the construction management portion that we do. So the oil and gas side and the related energy side except for the gas tax reduction in the state of Alaska has actually helped our power business.

Thinking about California, for 2016, how much of a headwind does the road budget for 2016?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I wouldn't call it really a huge headwind. I would call a lack of what I would want to see as a huge tailwind. There's plenty of work in California. The private sector is alive and well in California. I'm just frustrated that California can't get – I call it (45:45) and get moving on a very proactive environment where we know that this work has to get done. So California is one of our stronger states right now overall. And the way that we are performing business, the bottom line, the revenue and everything else, it just has another significant notch up that it can go when the politicians do what they are supposed to do.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Got it. And then I think there was some hope early on with the FAST Act that it could lead to higher spring lettings. Is there still a chance of that? I know you said that maybe the bidding was really too competitive.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I think there is. Well, no, I think there will be spring lettings. But remember what happens, Adam, a spring letting, let's just say typically you've got more states, you've got a minimum requirement of 30 days to 60 days of public announcement to actually put a public bid out, and then you've got somewhere between 30 days and 90 days to award the job typically inside the contract, and then you've got another 30 days before the notice to proceed and you physically get out on the grade. So that's why I was saying that I think we'll start seeing the positive effects of it late in the year. But we absolutely can see some spring lettings. But you still won't see the financial effects of that until later in the year.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Got it. And then can you give any color – the Large Project margin was 10% last year, maybe mid-teens next year. I mean how should we think about it for 2016?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, what we mentioned there was that it should be somewhere in between. We said that it should be better than last year, but we don't see it at the mid-teens range in 2016. We've got some early progression projects. And again, we've mentioned before that at the early part of our projects, we hold some moneys back to try to make sure that the jobs are heading in the right direction and when the portfolio mix is still young, you are going to naturally have a lower margin expectation. So we mentioned 2017 is when we start seeing getting back to the typical expectation, 2016 will be somewhat as a progression from where 2015 was and in between 2015 and 2017.

Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
But everything you've seen with those four mega jobs that you started late last year is encouraging to you or any change?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, they are very complicated jobs and complex inside and outside, but all four of them are progressing quite well. Again, only two of them are over the 50% mark, and two of them are early in the stage, just the I-4 is very early in the stage and the Pennsylvania job is in the first quartile of its stage. So again, we expect lower margins while they are in those early stages. And the Tappan Zee is progressing quite well and it has had a very nice 2015. Weather certainly helped in 2014 and the previous two winters did not help that job.
And I think I-35 has progressed quite nicely in the second half of the year. It got done with some serious range in the first half of the year and it is progressing well now as well, but what happens is that when you get your new work, now you start having to add on, you've got the 202 which is a really nice win for Granite. You got the Alabama I-59, I-20 job, another nice win. Now you've got to mix those young ones back into the portfolio.
So I think that our projects are going well. I think that you are going to see that we're going to continue to increase the backlog and progression will be a combination of how well we execute and how well really we can get to work in some of those locations where we've got some significant winners. New York so far is good. Pennsylvania is kind of come and go. I know they got some weather hitting right now, but overall I think our Large Project progression in 2016 should improve from 2015.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Perfect. Thanks, Jim.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
All right. Thank you.

The next question comes from Michael Dudas of Sterne, Agee. Go ahead, sir.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.
Thanks for the follow-up. Cash flow pretty strong in the quarter, looks like pretty good year. Laurel, remind us about the debt repayment, where that's headed? And the follow-up, Jim, given the outlook that you're presenting and you said in the past about potential acquisitions, how do you feel about that today going into what looks like to be pretty good upturn next few years?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Why don't you hit the cash line first, Laurel?
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Sure. So we have private placement notes that have five years of $40 million of payments, and the first payment was due in December of 2015. We refinanced our credit facility in the fourth quarter in October, and as part of that, we took a portion of it as a term loan, and we used $30 million of that term loan to pay off some of the $40 million and then used cash for the remainder of it. And so, every year, we will – and our plans for 2016 are similar to what we did in 2015.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Right. And then the other thing that happens with that new credit facility, obviously larger than our old credit facility. It ties nicely into the second question, the M&A side, and we certainly are considering expanding the business through acquisition. We are in the market to look and see what's out there. We like, and I mentioned it before, diversifying geographically and in both end market, diversifying into the water market I think is really top on our list, geographically diversifying our vertically integrated business is top on our list. And I think one of the things I've always said that's really important is that, you do not move into the acquisition mode before you are efficient and effective in your core business at all times. And I'm happy to say that I think our teams have done a tremendous job in 2015, becoming more efficient, more effective. And our strategic plan is to grow both organically and through acquisitions.

Michael S. Dudas - Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.
Thanks, Jim and Laurel.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You bet.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thanks.

The next question comes from Brian Rafn, Morgan Dempsey Capital Management. Go ahead, sir.
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Good morning, Jim.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Brian. How you doing?
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Doing good. We talked about $15 billion that you were looking at bidding out. How much of that is really high-end design build?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
The majority of it.
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Okay.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I would suggest that when we start looking at large projects work now, Brian, there's very few jobs. Remember, our threshold is $75 million, and most of the jobs today in this environment are way over $75 million. And most of them are design build. I'll give you an example of one that's not, that's actually bidding today, is a job in Hartford, Connecticut, which is a somewhere between $200 million and $400 million tunnel job that is a bid build. So different types of jobs are taking on different contractual outlooks. Tunnels are typically bid build. The other projects we're looking at are almost all design build nowadays, all the big ones.
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Okay. When you do joint ventures, you're talking about partnering, is there a priority to being the general, is there a benefit to being the lead? Or is it better to be just partner and diversify?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, okay. So that is a very strong topic of discussion inside Granite as well. And it's a very strategic question, Brian. In fact, it's a really good question, because there's a combination of things that you have to look at when you're – we'll call it yourself a sponsor or a non-sponsor on a joint venture. And when you get into design build, you have to make sure that if you're going to sponsor a job, that you have the personnel to lead the job and that could be up to 40 or 50 people. And I mentioned the engineering staff, and those people that you're going to need to put on a project in order to be the lead player. So you need to have those people available if you're going to lead a $1 billion job and be the sponsor.
The second thing that you need to be a sponsor is to make sure that you can handle the cash requirements of a large project. A lot of these projects will start with a cash call and equity infusion, and if you're going to be a 50% or 60% partner, you need to do some very strong cash flow curves on these jobs to determine what kind of cash the company is willing to infuse in the job before you get a distribution.
Now, secondarily – so that's part one. Part two is, a lot of times you can obligate yourself to a partner on the premise that if you are a non-sponsor or you're taking a smaller role today, that you promise your partner you're going to take a larger role a year down the road. And because it takes a lot of different requirements from the partners and sometimes there's not an even percentage of effort going into play, you could be a 40% partner and put in 60% of the assets and the resources. So you have to have sometimes sponsor, sometimes non-sponsor.
I think you're going to see Granite on jobs $500 million to $600 million and lower typically be the sponsor. And I think that when we get to the larger jobs, we would like to increase the size of projects that we're sponsoring. We're healthy. We're developing a lot of people in the field today, and I mentioned this earlier, in roles so that they can actually run these $1 billion jobs going forward and when they become completed on the jobs they're on and they become available into Granite for future work, I think you're going to see us bidding and sponsoring larger projects going down the road.

Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Okay. I appreciate that. On the aggregate side, how much of the volume are you guys using internal versus external sales?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's about 60% external, 40% internal.
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Okay. Okay. All right. And then you mentioned selectivity and you guys have always talked in the past about having discipline on bid day. The types of – and I don't know if you can quantify it or give some color, what are the types of projects that you've stayed away from? Are there geographic areas, are there specific owners, you don't have to obviously mention names, but what are the types of things that through history that you've decided to avoid?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's really important, Brian. That is such a big deal, especially in the Large Projects business. And I'll tell you what really surfaces in choosing and not choosing a job. Number one, can you get the right team? Are you in the game early? Do you have the right partners? And does that allow you an advantageous position on the project? Secondarily, we look heavily at the contractual documents themselves. How are they set up? Does this owner provide reasonable cash flow? Does this owner have a dispute resolution program that is fair? Are they the judge and jury with the dispute? And also we look at the history of how we've done with these agencies across the country. We dealt with the majority of these bigger agencies across the country and we know how they treat people.
The other thing we look at is when we go into a large job, we go okay, who are the competitors on this job and can we be competitive? And if there is somebody that we know has an advantaged position over Granite, then we are not going to spend millions in bidding a job if we really don't think we have a great shot at getting the job. So there is a host of issues that go into consideration and we actually have a complete committee in Granite that's led by our COO and our Head of our Large Projects Group and we have – we look at risk mitigation through our risk department, we have our legal department heavily involved in terms of how the contracts read, we have our business development group in there to look at the partnerships with not only our joint venture partners but our engineering partners.
It's a very comprehensive group that looks at all the opportunities and says okay, this one you have a chance for obtaining the work and you have a really good chance at getting the margin that Granite needs in order to come out to back end of the job.
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Yeah, okay. I appreciate it. And then several years ago during certainly the trough very difficult times, you talked about more mobility with your crews shifting around, expedite estimators. As you guys build in capacity, as you utilize capacity, as you build up kind of getting back to more normalized margin structures, is there less mobility because there is maybe less scarcity of business or are you still seeing more transfer and more mobility moving all over the country?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. So I think there's two parts to that question, Brian. First of all, I think in Large Projects there is always going to be mobility. Our people have to go to where those specialized large projects are and that's what our people sign up for and they know that, and they're very good at that.
Now when you go to the Construction business, when you start seeing the local markets get healthier which they are, then I think you're going to start seeing less mobility of those people because they're going to be in a market where they look out in front of them and see five years, 10 years of growth in the local market, and they know that they can create significant value for the company staying in that local market. The company is happy with it and we let them stay in those local markets. So, two parts to the question. The smaller work is going to be less mobility required due to the strength of local markets today. Large projects will always have mobility.

Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Okay. And then what – back to the old – yeah, I'm going to go back to legacy, so the old branch term business, which you guys would kind of call Construction today. What is the constitution of that business? Are you seeing some private sector real estate? Is it industrial parks? What – is it city and county highways, what kind of is the bread and butter of kind of that rebuild of that business?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, you nailed it, a lot of it. It is the fact that the – what happens in those local markets and you put a geographic boundary around the local market, Brian, and you say, okay, what's the health of the state, and then you dial into what's the health of the county or the larger next jurisdiction, and then what's the health of the local municipality? What's going on in the private sector and residential? Residential by the way I would say is not something that is driving our business today, but we're snipping opportunities, we are seeing developments starting and I'm going to say starting to be built again. But the commercial market is very strong. But what else we've done over the last five years is diversified into other parts of the business. We're doing a lot of work directly for the larger rail companies today. We are working for water facilities today that we didn't do. We are doing pipeline rehabilitation that we didn't do. We are seeing the renewable energy business that we didn't do.
And the other thing that we have actually migrated into and most of it is $75 million or less is in the federal market. We've actually gone to a whole new client. We've got a nice couple of jobs bidding in Guam, are coming up in the next couple of months. So we've diversified our portfolio and that's the strength of the Construction business today that we didn't have five years ago, Brian.
Brian Gary Rafn - Morgan Dempsey Capital Management LLC
Right. I got you. Hey, thanks, Jim. Appreciate it.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, Brian. Thank you.
Operator
And the final question for today comes from – pardon me. The final question today comes from William Bremer of Maxim Group. Go ahead.
William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC
Thank you, gentlemen. Just update on CapEx of 2016 and in particular what type of equipment and what are the lead times for that equipment? Have they increased at all?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I think our CapEx is definitely going up. We've been typically in the 2% to 3% of revenue range and we'll stay within that range, but it's sort of migrating towards the upper end as we start building new work. The other thing that happens is and I'll tell you one thing that's changed in our portfolio of capital expenditures is the tunneling industry. So when we go out and sponsor a large project, we now have to go out and buy these very, very intricate tunnel boring machines that can be $20 million each. Now, we typically get paid by the owner very quickly because they understand the cash requirements but that makes a very quick change in the overall volume of capital expenditures and those are quick turn items, so that's not a big deal.
I will say this that we've done a complete kind of reboot of our capital expenditure program inside at Granite and we're ordering equipment now in the fall of the previous year for delivery in the spring. And that was something that I commend our COO, Head of our Equipment Department and our local businesses are just planning better now. And so you give a six-month led time, but you've got to be that far in advance of the business.
William Bremer - Maxim Group LLC

Got you, Jim. Thank you.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. You bet. There was another question, though, that I better address. So, what happens if Trump gets elected, do we have bridge building abilities? I thought I heard that one in the background, and we've got tremendous bridge building abilities and that's what we do. So, certainly, we are ready for the next elected official to help build bridges and entire infrastructure in the U.S.
Operator
Okay. This ends our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to our host.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Very good. Well, thank you for your questions today. And thank you again to all the Granite employees for working safely, working hard and living our core values every single day. We look forward to seeing a few of you in San Francisco on Monday, Denver on Tuesday and Chicago in a few weeks from now.
And as always, Laurel, Ron and I are available for follow-up if any of you have any questions at all. Thank you. Have a good day.

Ronald Botoff - Director - Investor Relations
Welcome to the Granite Construction, Incorporated third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I'm here today with our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Roberts; and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Laurel Krzeminski.
We begin today with an overview of the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements.

For more information, visit our Investor Relations website at investor.graniteconstruction.com. Thank you.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Granite Construction, Incorporated Chief Executive Officer, Jim Roberts.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Ron. And good morning, everyone. Following another quarter of steady growth and solid performance, I first want to congratulate Granite teams across the country. The focus on execution throughout our business is driving improved results across geographies and across end markets. Our constant focus on safety remains a steady contributor to our performance and I am quite proud of the fact that we again are riding this trend toward another year of record company safety performance.
Another bright spot, speaking of records, our backlog at $3.1 billion once again moved the bar higher for us this quarter. I am particularly proud of our results in the third quarter. Lukewarm public spending trends continue to be a key revenue influencer. While revenue grew a little more than 4%, quarterly gross profit improved more than 51% and net income more than doubled from last year. Strong performance was broad with profitability growing in each segment and margins continuing their steady upward trend.
In the third quarter, we again were met by a consistent drumbeat of steady and competitive market conditions. However, without additional needed public funding, we do not expect a significant change to the current competitive landscape. Before highlighting segment performance and turning the call over to Laurel to discuss the financials, let me spend just a couple of moments speaking about everyone's most frustrating subject, public funding trends.

Let's start in Texas where our Large Project headquarters is located and on a positive note. Texas voters tomorrow are expected to approve SJR5, better known as Prop 7, which is expected to provide an additional $3 billion a year for TxDOT in an annual transfer from the Texas general fund. If approved, it would represent the largest single increase in transportation funding in the history of the state.
Importantly, Proposition 7 and last year's Texas ballot measure Proposition 1, both require funding to be used for certain dedicated budget line items, including right-of-way acquisition, construction, maintenance, and debt services. And we're getting more and more constructive about the coming opportunities here, in our home state of California.
Less than two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to present to the California Legislature's Special Session Conference Committee on Transportation. In two meetings, the committee was presented with the Governor's $36 billion (4:28) enhancement plan, as a potential starting point for discussion and negotiation. The overarching need for investment has been evident to all during these early-stage discussions, which notably have not been the base. While the terms and timing of the ultimate commitment in California remain uncertain, the vision for significant incremental, dedicated transportation investment is coming into focus. We're hopeful that 2016 can be a launch point for this critical investment.
And of course, our quarterly discussion would not be the same without at least a mention of the latest inaction from Washington, D.C. Just last week, Congress approved the 35th short-term patch to transportation funding in the past six years, extending funding three weeks through November 20. This sales strategy continues as we kick the proverbial can an ever shorter distance down an ever more crumbling road.
So while state and local level trends are encouraging, it ultimately requires support from a long-term federal highway bill to free the growing wave of tens or hundreds of billions of dollars of pent-up demand across our country. We still remain hopeful that Congress will take responsibility on this critical issue and pass a long-term bill this year. The latest short-term extension only through November 20 is a positive sign that negotiations between the House and Senate are getting closer to a final resolution. We stand ready as a willing partner, ready to grow and invest across our great country.
Now let's get back to our performance in the third quarter. First, a look at the Large Project segment, where results reflect improved steady performance on our early-stage portfolio. After first half of the year marked by challenging weather and new projects that initially ramped up slower than we had anticipated, we were able to build and recapture momentum in the quarter as revenue grew and gross margin reached double-digits. Our project portfolio now has shifted considerably from recent years as larger and newer projects now comprise the majority of our work in the segment.
Illustrating this point, the majority of our Large Project segment revenue in the third quarter was from four mega-size projects. This include the new New York Tappan Zee Bridge, the IH-35E in Texas, the I-4 Ultimate in Florida, and the Pennsylvania Rapid Bridge Replacement. Of these projects, only the Tappan Zee, which has made solid progress in 2015, has reached the halfway point of its project life.
As we have said for some time, with our project portfolio weighted towards projects early in progression, it produces margins that are lower in the initial stages of jobs than when the projects mature. While we focus on execution of more than $2.2 billion of Large Project backlog, we also are focused on successfully targeting, teaming, bidding, and winning additional new work.

Our Large Projects and federal groups recently teamed up to win a $72 million dam modification project in Texas. Following project funding approval just last Friday, our tunnel division expects to receive notice to proceed later this week on a more than $180 million project in Akron, Ohio. These wins reflect a large project market that continues to show strength for Granite.
Looking ahead, we have teaming agreements in place and expect to bid on more than $16 billion of Large Projects just between now and the end of 2016. And in fact, between now and the end of this year, we expect to bid on $5 billion worth of projects. These include the more than $2 billion Purple Line in Maryland, the Grand Parkway in Houston at $800 million, and in Arizona the $1.2 billion Loop 202 South Mountain Freeway in Phoenix. Our percentage of participation in these projects remains in line with recent history.
Building on the success we had in the first half of the year, another key contributor of the third quarter performance was continued execution from our vertically integrated business. Once again, our Construction and Construction Materials segments delivered solid year-over-year improvement. The Construction segment posted year-over-year margin improvement for the sixth consecutive quarter with performance fueled by improvements across geographies and across end markets.
Power and underground continued their strong performances in 2015, helping drive segment margins north of 15% in the quarter. Both the public and private sectors are driving the steady improvement in local markets. Market and bidding environments remain fairly stable but quite competitive. Private and industrial market activity remains a focus of our growth and our diversification opportunities. Our teams are focused on improved pricing expectations and bidding discipline across geographies. We continue to demand more value for our products and our services.
The consistent performance and improvement of our Construction Materials business was evident again in the third quarter. Once again, internal and external demand drove revenue and profit growth. The business is now operating at levels that we have not seen since the economic downturn, with volumes in the quarter increasing double-digits over 2014. The result has been year-to-date margins at a multi-year high of more than 11%, our highest level since 2008.
Plant efficiency remains in focus and a highlight area for the business as operational and continuous improvement success at our materials facilities drives ongoing cost management gains. Of course, while headlines hopefully will trumpet our next $1 billion project win soon, it is equally as exciting for us to highlight the positive momentum in our vertically integrated business. This momentum is very real, as is the growing level of pent-up demand and this represents an enormous growth opportunity for Granite.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Laurel to discuss results and our 2015 outlook. Laurel?
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Third quarter 2015 revenues were $751.4 million, up 4.4% from last year. Earnings per share in the quarter more than doubled to $0.77 compared with $0.38 in 2014. All segments contributed to third-party gross profit growth of 51.3% to nearly $101 million, and total gross profit margin increased 416 basis points year-over-year in the third quarter to 13.4%. On a year-to-date basis, gross profit of $206.8 million grew 21.3%, which translated to 176 basis points of year-over-year margin improvement to 11.9% at the end of Q3.
Certainly, we're not where we want to be or need to be yet, but we are making great progress as we continue our recovery from recent trough levels. SG&A expenses increased 5.7% in the quarter, but they've risen just 2.5% year-to-date. We continue to maintain and manage a strong balance sheet with more than $310 million in cash and marketable securities at quarter end.

Total contract backlog at the end of the third quarter was $3.1 billion, yet another all-time record, up 3.9% from last year. Large Project Construction segment backlog increased 3.1% to more than $2.2 billion, and Construction segment backlog increased 6% year-over-year to more than $866 million. Our runway build continues.
Let's take a look at segment results. Third quarter Construction segment revenues decreased 4.5%, but we were particularly pleased with gross profit margin of 15.1%, up 414 basis points from 10.9% last year. Strong execution across geographies and across end-markets drove the profit growth, with particular strength in certain parts of the West and across the Kenny business lines.
Large Project segment revenues increased 21% in the third quarter, and gross profit margin increased 723 basis points to 10.4%, up from 3.2% last year. This reflects a now complete year-over-year transition from a portfolio weighted between mature and new products, including a couple of challenging projects.
Today, our project portfolio remains heavily weighted toward newer, larger projects, still fairly early in progression. And also today, we progressed past most of last year's mature projects and thankfully, last year's challenges are now largely behind us.
So while we expect mid-teens margins over the life of projects with four large and early stage jobs comprising the majority of our Large Projects revenue, we continue to expect margins to remain lower in the earlier stages of these jobs than when the projects mature through the project lifecycle over the next few years.
And finally, back to the growing bright spot in our Construction Materials segment where revenues increased 15.1% year-over-year during the third quarter. Segment profitability increased at about the same pace producing gross profit margin of 13.1% in line with last year as strong volume trends drove revenue and profit growth.
Before I touch on our guidance, let me offer a quick update on two areas. First, an update on the year-to-date comparison of both initial profit recognition as well as that for claim recognition and claim recovery related to the change in our accounting policy this year.
As disclosed in our 10-Q which will be filed today, on a year-to-date basis at the end of the third quarter of 2015, initial profit recognition totaled $21.6 million, a decrease from $50 million in the prior year period. Year-to-date claim recognition in 2015 totaled $44.7 million, compared to claim recovery of $23.2 million in the prior year period.
Second, as expected and subsequent to the close of the third quarter, we completed a second amended and restated credit agreement. The facility provides for an increase to $300 million from $215 million, of which $200 million is a revolving credit facility, and $100 million is a term-loan with the revised maturity date of October 2020. We intend to use a portion of the facility to pay down $40 million of initial principal payment on our higher cost senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 while utilizing the remainder to help fuel our growth strategy.
And finally, as we noted in our earnings press release this morning, we did maintain the annual guidance we provided to you back in February. We continue to expect mid-single digit consolidated revenue growth in 2015 with EBITDA margin in a range of 6% to 8%.
Now before we take your questions, let me turn the call back to Jim.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Laurel. All-in-all, our solid third quarter and steady year-to-date performance reflects continued recovery from a more than six year industry slowdown. Across the country, the construction industry has been sidelined by the lack of long-term dedicated federal transportation funding. We're already partner, ready to build new capacity, ready to repair our ageing infrastructure and ready to invest for future generations.

At Granite, we are building a stronger, deeper organization with internal resources aligned to our operations to help us compete more effectively across end markets and across geographies. We are poised for the next steps on our evolution, well prepared to leverage our capabilities and to accelerate our company's growth.
And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.

Thank you very much. The first question comes today from Daniel Scott with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Daniel Scott - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Dan.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Daniel Scott - Cowen & Co. LLC
You mentioned there at the end of the comments that obviously the major projects are early stages and lower margin, other than Tappan Zee, they're all earlier in life and half way. What year are we looking at for the existing portfolio of Large Projects where they will kind of hit their max profitability level for lack of a better term?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I would say out of those four now, again, it's going to depend on the new wins as well. So, on those four mega projects, I would suggest to you next year we'll be in full stride on all four of them. But remember, as we continue to build new projects, which we absolutely anticipate we will, we'll hit on a few of these coming up, it is going to really again weight the portfolio towards those four getting into the maturity stages and then some younger ones in the preliminary stages. So it will continue to evolve, Dan, over time, but those four, probably 2016 and 2017, they'll be hitting on all strides.
Daniel Scott - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay, great. And then last quarter you made comments about aggregates pricing was encouraging. And I think you said it was especially the higher quality products were showing the most strength. Is that trend continuing?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It is. In fact, I would suggest that the higher quality products are becoming the higher demand products and that continues to really work directly into our material strategy as we try to make sure that we provide the higher quality products into the marketplace. So, yes, it's continuing and as noted in the financials and in some of Laurel's points there during her discussion, the materials business is really strong right now.
Daniel Scott - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thanks. And then just one last thing. In the past, you've looked at potential to add, I think some geographic diversity to aggregates as you try to move projects more into the East. And also looked at water, are you still thinking kind of those sort of potential growth areas through M&A?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, Dan. In fact, I would just reinforce those are the two major areas of emphasis. We'd love to move our vertically integrated strategy eastward, and we do like several end market diversification strategies, one of which is water.
Daniel Scott - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay, great. Thanks so much, guys.

The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT
Good morning, Jim and Laurel.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, Mike.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT
Don't want to – I'll knock on wood here. So if things maybe turn out more positively with new Speaker, House and Senate getting together. Everybody's loving each other now in Washington, so they say. Can you take me through how this would evolve for the industry in general and how for Granite particular, how much time, lag time, how pent-up are fittings, can we see meaningful activity in 2016 from this type of certainty? I know it's going to be very geographic and such related, but maybe just share your observation on how that might occur for the industry and for Granite?

James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, Mike. So, maybe let me go back and give you my opinion of what's happening first and it hasn't changed actually in the last two quarters. As we expected, whether it is a Boehner as Speaker or Ryan as Speaker or whether it is Inhofe or Boxer heading up public work side of the Senate, we're looking at end of the year bill coming into fruition and as we got these extensions over the last week from the House side moving and the Senate moving to November 20 date for a highway bill, that's a really good sign. If you read and talk to a lot of the people that are in the know in D.C., you'll hear a very strong level of optimism that they are working behind scenes to get something done.
And if you follow what happens in D.C., well if we get a bill out of the House and they get a bill which supposed to be the working on this week heavily and we go back to the July bill, call it the back from the Senate. If we can get both of them to pass those bills, then it goes to conference and what we are hearing today is that there is not a lot of work to get him to conference. And what we're hearing today is that the two bills that have been laid out so far are very similar, in fact very, very similar. The Senate bill has a little higher overall revenue base than the House bill, but overall the terminology is very similar.
So they go into conference committee, if they can get a bill done and let's call it by Thanksgiving or pushing off even by Christmas which I'm fairly confident of now, I think, it will infuse an attitude immediately into the system, into the DOTs, when they have an approach, where they have certainty of their funding, they will put work out to bid in advance of knowing that they've actually got a longer-term bill out in front of them. So I think 2016, now we'll see the value of it in the back half, because I think we'll see the projects coming out to bid in the first half of 2016, and what we'll end up seeing Mike is, we'll see some of the work coming on to our books and the bottom line by the second half of 2016 and then obviously continuing on from there.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT
Very helpful, Jim. My follow-up would be, given tomorrow being election day, I don't know if there's any initiative that you guys have on your screen throughout the U.S. that might be helpful, but maybe even talk about – maybe for 2016, certainly with California you mentioned in your prepared remarks, do you anticipate in a 2016 election there will be a lot of those types of opportunities to kind of dovetail with some of this momentum you are seeing come out of Washington?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I do. In fact, let me go back and give you obviously the two big states that I mentioned real briefly in my remarks. California, it has been battling back and forth ever since the end of the regular session when they put together a special session starting in July and August and they've been running all the way through November now trying to put together a long-term $59 billion shortfall mechanism in the State of California.
The special session I had the privilege of talking with them, in front of them two weeks ago and they're going to get something done in California, that's fairly clear, the question is going to be when. And then if you look at what's going in California, the Governor's proposal is a $36 billion 10-year program with a shortfall of $59 billion, so there are a host of legislators that believe that the $36 billion is not large enough, which of course you can imagine, Mike, I agree with them.
So, that one is going to probably take a little time to work out because they've got a host of mechanisms and this is what's happening in most of these states. You're looking at potentially increased gas, diesel taxes; you're looking at increased licensing fees, increased registration fees. And in California in particular, during the downturn there were monies that were taken from the potential highway transportation budget and maneuvered back into the general fund. So they are trying to take money from the general fund and move it back to the transportation bill. So, those are all things that take time to work out. And I think it will work itself out in California between the end of this year or maybe by the end of the first quarter. And I'm firmly in belief that they'll get something accomplished so that it will start taking some traction by the end of next year.

Now, another big one that I mentioned briefly was SJR 5, better known as Proposition 7, in Texas. Now that's an interesting one because the way that one works and that goes to the polls tomorrow and strictly needs a majority vote in the State of Texas. And what that says is actually simpler. What it says that, if revenues exceed a certain amount in the Texas budget then the overspill can go into transportation. And their projections are that there will be excess revenue coming into the proposal, so coming into the actual Texas DOT coffers.
So, that one looks like a good chance of passing and looks like there's a really good chance of getting it funded based on Texas revenue. So, those are the two big ones. I haven't followed a lot of the smaller ones recently. We talked about in our last call, Mike, that Washington just passed a $16 billion program. Utah passed a really nice increase in their gas tax. So, all the states have really stepped up and now we've got the federal government just kind of needs to – it's teed up, they need to hit the home run.
Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT
Jim, that's quite encouraging. Thanks for your thoughts. Appreciate it.

The next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good morning, everyone.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Jerry.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
I'm wondering if you could just talk about what's the cadence of major Large Project awards on bids that you're involved with? Can you help us get a sense what the next couple of quarters should look like from an activity standpoint?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, maybe ask that again, Jerry. You want to know which projects we're bidding?
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
So, out of the projects that you're bidding and in your slide deck, you typically have a list of 10 Large Projects that you're bidding, I'm wondering if you'd just talk about when those projects are expected to be awarded.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Very good. So, a couple of them that I mentioned in my discussions earlier, we've got a Large Project bidding in Arizona, the Loop 202 South Mountain Freeway. That job just is turning in as we speak this week and that one will have an answer in January, as to who will be the winner of that project. And that's over $1 billion project.
The Purple Line light rail job in Maryland, we've been talking about this one for quite some time, it goes in in December. We will most likely hear about that sometime in late in the first quarter where that goes. So that one's on the move fairly quickly. What other one did I mentioned to you on there? On Houston, the Grand Parkway job, so that one – we should hear on that one where we end up in December. So, that's a nice one. We also turned in the Grand Central Caverns project in New York, and we should hear about that any day as well. So, there's a host of big ones that we are turned in in the fourth quarter here that we should hear about several of them this year and then another couple of them early next year. And then, I'd be happy to walk through more bids if you'd like to hear some more, Jerry.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Sure. That'd be great, Jim. Any other major ones beyond that?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, a couple of ones, our federal group is actually bidding quite a bit of work out in Guam and that's really nice to see again. There's a nice work for the NAVFAC Pacific, the NAVFAC Marianas, both Guam jobs, that's nice to see. We're bidding a very large project up at Sound Transit in Seattle on the Lynnwood Link Extension. We're looking at the next phase of the I-35 job, the Southern Gateway. We're bidding that in the first quarter of next year.

We're actually bidding a large rail transit project in Hawaii that we've been shortlisted on, which is a very nice job, it's still listed down to three bidders, and we'll be bidding that in the first quarter of next year. And I can go on, the list is endless, Jerry, it's just again like I said, we got $16 billion of projects we're bidding in the next 12 months, 12 months to 13 months.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
And then, Laurel, can you just talk about how we should think about operating leverage in Construction Materials? Your incremental margins this quarter were similar to absolute margins. What drove that? Was there any allocation internal versus external, and how should we think about operating leverage going forward?
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah. So, 65% of the material production has been external. And as we've said, we continue to work on efficiencies in our materials business. We had a heavy cost base of fixed cost that we had to work now. We have increased volumes and that's stopping directly to the bottom line, so, nice solid improvement in our Construction Materials business.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
The other thing Jerry, that's really important and Laurel started alluding to it relative to our overall cost, we have built up a very nice overall structure of equipment and plants across the Western U.S. And as those – as the materials market increases and the volume increases, you certainly get efficiencies that we haven't been able to see in a slower economic period.
So, as we start increasing volumes, a lot of our fixed costs are getting distributed over a larger volume and it's creating higher margins for us as well. So we are lowering our costs, we've seen somewhere around a mid single-digit increase in pricing this year or we see more pricing increases coming for next year, and we see the demand being quite steady and nice.
So, really the materials business is getting back to where we know it can be, and that's really the important part. When you have a steady local economy, that will drive the materials business. And then if you can layer on a state transportation budget, you can layer on a federal transportation highway bill, those are really the icing on the cake with the materials business.
Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you.

The next question comes from Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global Securities.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Good morning, guys.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Mike.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Can you just share with us, I guess – so what's being talked about in a conference here in Congress? Is this a bill that could come out or could get passed? Is this in line with what you were hoping for from a highway bill? Is it bigger or smaller than what you were thinking about, maybe back when this whole thing first started many, many years back?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay, Mike. Well, let me be very candid and open with you upfront. Is that what I had hoped for, absolutely not. But, probably what I had hoped for was never going to happen, Mike. So, let's be realistic. But the key ingredient I think from the feds really is not the size of the program, it is the longevity and the certainty that it provides long-term for the industry. So, from that perspective, I am very happy that it's a six year bill. Now, one of the things that both the Senate and the House have been focusing on is trying to figure out the funding mechanism for the back three years. They both agreed so far in their individual bills that they will fund it for three years, but they've got to find more funding in the back half.

So, I am fine with the overall value increase. It's an incremental increase on an annual basis over the six year period which is fine. I'd like to see a little more TIFIA money in the finished product. They've got the TIFIA monies at about $200 million to $300 million with about a 30 multiple projection of what it puts into the overall transportation economy. So, down the middle, that's about another $7.5 billion annually. I'm fine with all the money part. Not what I hoped for, but I'm actually fine with it, because I think it creates value. I think what we need to do now between now and I'll say November 20, as we get into conference, is we need to do a little more work on how we're going to fund the back half of the overall bill.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Got it. Yeah. Got it. And my follow up is, I'm getting the sense that if a big bill like this is passed, are there some companies out there that perhaps were prequalified here, could start to ramp up and hire people to kind of get themselves prepared? And perhaps broadly can you give us your overall thoughts on the state of obtaining and keeping labor on your team for the next, let's say 12 months to 18 months?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. So, labor is certainly a discussion. But let me get into that in just a second. So, I don't think that, that what happens in this industry is you can't be in and out of the industry, one day out and then back in the next day. So, I don't see a highway bill changing the competitive landscape from adding a whole bunch of new players. What I do see is there will be more competition for labor and fixed resources. What will happen is that companies like Granite, we've got tremendous elasticity, we've actually shrunk that portion of our business that I think will be affected by highway bill, and that would specifically be our vertically integrated business. They will be the largest beneficiaries of a highway bill. And those – they have set labor forces in their markets and obviously we're a major player in most of the markets we work in.
So, I think it's actually advantageous to people like us that have a strong presence already in the marketplace. I think the industry as a whole, Mike, the issue is going to be is do we enough labor force in the overall industry. I'm very comfortable with the wage rates that Granite pays and the relationships we have with our employees that will be able to increase our work force. But I do think that you have to be in the market today to take advantage of the highway bill that we're about to get.
Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.

The next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Hey, good morning, guys.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Adam.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Nice quarter. In the Construction segment, you had a very strong margin in the quarter and you said that you had some contribution there from Kenny. I'm just curious whether is that a good run rate going forward or were there some unusual items in the quarter?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, let's do it this way. Again, we don't talk about individual segments relative to run rates and guidance and all that, but I will say this, and I'm glad you brought it up. The Kenny business is progressing very, very nicely. Obviously that was a very nice acquisition for Granite. They are a great team. The two portions of the business that showed really strong encouragement in the third quarter was the underground business, which is our rehabilitation and pipelining business, and our power business, which is very strong with the utilities and our relationship in the construction management role with a lot of these large utilities across the country. I see that sustaining itself nicely over time, and those both have very nice markets. Interestingly enough, the two lines that I didn't discuss are progressing nicely in Kenny as well. We're expanding our civil business in the Midwest and we have some new, young, very talented management that's helping us to expand that business very nicely.

And then the other thing I didn't talk about was the power business. It's been a really good business for us. We just got a new job in Akron, Ohio and we see more opportunities out in front of us on the tunnel side. So, all in all, the Kenny business is performing at a very nice level, and I don't think it is an anomaly one quarter at a time – one quarter anomaly relative to the margins, but I, again I would not want to provide any guidance relative to any of the individual segments.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. And then can you just provide a quick update on private construction in the West and also what you're seeing on housing in the West?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, let's start with the negative first, housing. I just have not seen housing really take off to any magnitude at all, and it is not a really strong driver in our business right now and I've always said that when the residential market takes off again, that will just be, again, more icing on the cake so to speak for Granite. And historically it's been a nice driver of our materials business.
On the other side, on a very positive side, we are seeing very strong industrial, very strong commercial. Both of those markets have heeded up nicely and we are migrating towards a larger percentage of private work relative to our overall portfolio than we've had in a long, long time. So, the markets especially in the West, and the commercial industrial markets are really progressing quite nicely.
Adam Robert Thalhimer - BB&T Capital Markets
Great. Okay. Thanks a lot.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

The next question comes from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Hi. Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, John.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Couple of just follow up. In terms of the – just going back to the Large Project business and your comments Jim about three of those four Large Projects that were driving business in the quarter not really hitting stride yet. With the way you estimate margins for these projects, can you just give us a sense of the range between the margins in the early stages and at the back half, and still expectations that – I assume that this is a mid to high-teens project business. Is that correct?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Yeah, John, I think that that's a good question. I think let me state it to begin with that. You know our business quite well and we've always said that our Large Project business is a mid-teen margin business and we continue to believe that that is the case and that is our expectation. But what we end up doing when we bid and build our work, we definitely hold back, and I'm going to call it contingencies, upfront. There are a lot of unknowns once we start with this work. And we create contingencies with milestones attached to them so that as we get more comfortable and confident as the progression of the job assuming we didn't run into an issue, we release contingency as the job progresses.
Now, what's happening is about the way we have created most of our milestones is that they don't tend to get to the release point until probably you're halfway done. And I think that's part of the issue when we talk about early progression, we still hold some monies back just in case certain issues that we have predefined, if they do come up and they occur, then we've got money set aside for them.
So, as I was mentioning earlier, it depends on where the weighted portfolio is. And in today's current book of business, outside of Tappan Zee, the other three mega projects are early in progression and still have contingencies setting aside for them, to hopefully be released, assuming we get past milestones and don't have issues in those milestones.

John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And can you give us a sense of the orders of magnitude now between the swings? It used to be zero at under 25% and then up over mid-teens in the remaining 75%. I mean, are you booking these projects at single-digit margins initially?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, again, two ways to look at it. The answer is no, but we are booking them in the lower-teen range...
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
...and lower double-digit range and then releasing contingencies as we move forward. And the whole...
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. I just wanted to get an order of magnitude.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, I would say – if you want to put it in the – it's in the double-digit ranges though, we won't bid a job at single-digits or expect anything in the single-digit range. Double-digits have always been there and then with the contingency on top of that, that works ourselves towards the mid-teen range.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. And then, Laurel, and I haven't seen the Q yet, but you mentioned there were claims for the nine months of $44.7 million versus the recoveries last year. Can you tell us what those were in the quarter?
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
The year-over-year variance was about $20 million between profit recognition and claims.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. So, $20 million in incremental cost in the quarter.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Right, between claims and profit.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
No, incremental revenue.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Oh, incremental revenue? Sorry.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Right.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And then lastly, it's minor amounts, but you haven't had the significant asset sales that we've seen in the last couple of years and I know some of that's the excess property, but your thoughts there? I mean, is the market not there or have you just got your equipment and your assets where you want them now?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think it's a little bit of both, John. I think that we do have assets for sale and some sizable ones. But at the same time, some of them are very special assets and they're going to take the right buyer at the right time. And overall I think that the – when you look at the smaller assets, which would be our equipment maintenance, older equipment, that market's been kind of stale and we've got no reason to dump our equipment at any cheap prices out into the marketplace. So we just hold on to it. We become opportunistic. When the right opportunities come, we actually sell them at that time.
The other thing to think about is we have tried not to sell a lot of our assets. We're pretty bullish on the fact that this overall highway program is going to increase and we're going to need every asset we have to go build the work that's going to be coming out in front of us. So we don't see a real strong desire to sell rolling stock. Certainly if we have some old land assets that are no longer useful, those are the ones we'd try to turn over.
John Bergstrom Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co.
Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

Great. Thank you. Jim, quick question, just about international competition. Obviously, it's happening, it's inevitable in the larger projects. But can you tell us if you're starting to see any impact on pricing on the projects that you're bidding on and if it's impacting any win rates?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That actually is a very interesting environment. And we have seen increased competition from international companies, and I think it has affected the prices. They're winning their share. I will say this, it's not affecting what we think we need to get out of our work in Large Projects. We continue to be very disciplined in the margin expectations that we have on Large Projects.
We have noticed that when we don't win a project and it is potentially an international competitor that does beat us, some of the pricing can make you shake your head and question whether or not it is overly aggressive. But that's somebody else's business. And if they want to stay that aggressive in what I consider to be a high risk, high reward business, that's certainly their choice. But for us, we're going to stay disciplined and keep our pricing where it is.
And the other thing I would suggest to you on these large Large Projects, the majority of the win or lose will come out of the innovativeness of how you design, how you build, how you finance the work. It typically is not based on the margin. And we consistently look at whether we get a project or don't, it's based on how the project has come together with us, working with our designers and our financers. So I don't think margin is an issue, but I have seen some international competition is bidding the work very cheap.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Okay. And then, Laurel, I'm assuming the Folsom Dam project was completed in the quarter. Were there any significant contingencies there that had an impact on Large Project margins?
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Our 10-Q is going to be released today. But the revisions and estimates aren't significant, net and year-over-year, so.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I think that it was completed, but it's got some work we're doing with the owner, the Corps of Engineers, to get it totally cleaned up. The majority of the work is basically completed, but it is not a significant player on the financials in the third quarter.
Min Chung Cho - FBR Capital Markets & Co.
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today will come from Nick Coppola with Thompson Research Group.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
Hi. Good morning.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Nick.
Laurel J. Krzeminski - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning, Nick.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
So, looking at the Construction segment again, apart from the industrial type work and private type work, can you just talk more about public trends, the competitive environment there, whether it's getting any better and what's happening with bid lists?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So when you say public, let's talk about the different kinds of public work. Certainly you have your DOTs, which would be the majority of the largest public sector. The other areas would be municipalities, the cities, the counties. And I would say that the bid lists are stagnant, I'd say in the five range to six range, we've been talking about that for quite some time. And I would say the pricing is just stable, it's the same as it has been.

I haven't seen it get better and I haven't seen it get a whole lot worse. Overall, I think that as we get to a larger program, I think that's when you're going to start seeing the pricing move. But with the programs being diminished today, some of the state programs just starting to kick in, you get a federal highway bill that kicks in, that's when I'm going to see probably the smaller bid list, Nick, and the higher pricing opportunities, but it hasn't happened yet. So everything we're doing is pretty much in a stable environment for the last 12 months.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
Have you been seeing any regional highlights that are by state when you look across your offices?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, we have and I really try not to dive into individual states. But certainly I'll give you one state that I think is healthier than it was four years or five years ago, and that's California. It's done quite a bit better overall. And I think it's really the private sector that's driving it in California.
You look at the overall work we're doing, we're building some major complexes for new office space. We're really heavily involved in the solar work. We're really doing a lot more private work in California. So one of the bright spots out of all the states would be California. And also we're seeing some picked up activity in the other states around there as well, but obviously California is one of our biggest state in the country.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
Okay. Then my last question. Can you just talk a little bit more about what Prop 7 would do for your business, particularly how much incremental demand for Larger Projects could that drive?
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, okay. So, Prop 7, the way I read Prop 7 is that I don't think it's going to have a huge effect on our business overnight for two reasons. First of all, in Texas, the work that we do there is mostly Large Projects.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
Right.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And those are focused on – I'll call it quasi-municipal, quasi-public agencies that have revenue streams that allow them to build these $1 billion jobs. I don't see Prop 7 affecting those Large Projects. What I see Prop 7 doing is increasing the day-to-day smaller work in Texas, of which I would love to see Granite have a larger role in the State of Texas. So between Prop 1 and Prop 7, I think what you're going to see is an enhanced local programs, which will help us in the overall Larger Projects because we do compete with some local players in Texas on the larger work. So I think they're going to probably be pretty darn happy with the local work and they may not migrate into the Large Projects. But Prop 7, I don't see the way it's written today that it's going to have a large play in Large Projects funding.
Nicholas Andrew Coppola - Thompson Research Group LLC
Okay. Understood. Thanks for taking my question.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A portion of today's call. So I would like to turn the call back over to our hosts.
James Hildebrand Roberts - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. Everyone, thank you for your questions. And thank you again to the Granite employees for working hard, working safely, and living the Granite core values every single day.
