About


Lab7 Systems’ vision is to reduce the level of hands-on data management by bioinformaticians, scientists, and IT teams who are struggling with the massive amounts of data that are being generated by modern analytical technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, mass spectrometry, cellular imaging, fMRI, and others. We understand that there is a critical need to develop a tool that will integrate the disparate and often disjointed scientific software toolkit that is being used, and thereby free up the valuable human resources who are currently tasked with doing this. We are all scientists from each of our core constituencies who have at one time or another faced the same issues, so we bring this intimate knowledge to our development process.
We are founded on the following core principles:

Understanding the problems faced by biologists, bioinformaticians, and IT professionals
Bringing extensive domain knowledge to tackle these core issues
Making our platform easy to operate, easy to customize, and easy to maintain
Being as transparent as possible
Delivering the maximum functionality at a minimal price

 THE FIRST OF ITS KIND 
 The Lab7 Enterprise Science Platform (ESP) is the first complete sample-to-answer software platform for data-intensive laboratory operations.

Tracking samples, managing
workflows



















Informatics
Process data, analysis pipelines




















Results
Producing reports, visualizing data













 THE HEART OF ESP:
 A FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE WORKFLOW ENGINE









ESP's workflow engine organizes your lab around different data-rich workflows. ESP Workflows encompass not only wet lab operations but support full integration of analysis and reporting, drastically reducing the amount of IT "machinery" required to manage, process, and analyze samples. ESP's Resource Manager maintains data provenance throughout




HOW DOES ESP...






TRACK SAMPLES AND MANAGE WORKflOWS
DEVELOP PIPELINES AND AUTOMATE ANALYSIS
GENERATE REPORTS AND SHARE RESULTS
KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE DATA IN THE SYSTEM - RESOURCE MANAGER




LIMS: SAMPLE AND PROTOCOL MANAGEMENT
The Lab7 ESP's LIMS tools are designed to provide full transparency into your operations. Whether running as a complete LIMS solution or complementing your existing LIMS, the Lab7 ESP streamlines sample
tracking and communication between lab technicians, managers, and scientists


The Lab7 ESP’s LIMS functionality gives your laboratory the tools it needs to maintain critical records, and forms the basis for the provenance that will be required for downstream reports.





Sample & Experiment Tracking




The Lab7 ESP gives stakeholders a detailed view of a sample’s status in its workflow. As samples move from the lab into analysis, users can view results as they become available directly from the
Lab7 ESP; no more hunting around for spreadsheets or emailing technicians for status reports.





Protocol Management


In the lab, efficient protocol management and data entry are key for maintaining quality and throughput goals. A typical NGS lab will have a Protocol, LIMS, Data management, bioinformatics variety of protocols it will run to prepare samples for its sequencers. As the laboratory moves into more clinical or other regulated environments, accurate record keeping, along with tracking a sample’s progression through the preparation, become stringent requirements




Protocols in our LIMS functionality are built around customizable spreadsheet views for fast data entry. Spreadsheets are created for each lab technician, giving them a concise view into their daily workflow.







ANALYSIS PIPELINE MANAGER
The Lab7 ESP's Analysis Pipeline Manager is a comprehensive set of pipeline creation and management tools designed to seamlessly integrate into your existing bioinformatics environment. The pipeline engine is accessible via Web interface, command line, or via RESTful API calls.





Pipelines


The core of our Analysis Pipeline Manager is a task graph execution engine that provides maximum flexibility for creating complex pipelines. Our pipeline manager sits on top of your IT environment and supports parallel execution with all major job schedulers and integrated file
tracking on any file system.




The Lab7 ESP's detailed monitoring interface gives you real time visibility into your pipeline's status and makes it easy to monitor many pipelines in a high-throughput environment.





Tasks


Tasks can be any shell script that can execute on the target compute resource. No plugins or custom wrappers are required; simply take your current shell-based pipelines and migrate them directly to the Lab7 ESP.


Tasks leverage a flexible templating engine that allows shell scripts to be fully parameterized. Our templating language provides a rich set of operations that can be used to modify parameters as they are used by different tasks in a pipeline.








REPORTS, ANNOTATIONS, AND VISUALIZATIONS
The Lab7 ESP’s reporting and visualization engine allows scientists to view reports from pipelines as they are executing, giving them unprecedented access to their data during the analysis phase.





Customized Report Generation


Reports in the Lab7 ESP can be created from any data generated within a Lab7 Workflow, including any file that is registered with the system during the execution of a pipeline. The Lab7 ESP includes a variety of data visualizations, such as plots and charts, text and table tools, and heatmaps, but since the ESP is a web application, you also have the flexibility to utilize any other HTML content or tools. You can also pull in external files and data to include the necessary level of data reporting and content that your audience requires.






Integrated Genome Browsing


The Lab7 ESP includes a genome browser that can be integrated into reports to interactively display genomic content and annotations. The browser includes support for all common sequencing file formats, including FASTA, BAM, BED, GFF, VCF, Wig/bigWig. Display tracks can combine data registered from pipelines, local data on the user’s computer, or remote data supplied by DAS (Distributed Annotation System) services.




Variant Annotation Management


The Lab7 ESP’s Annotation Manager is a complete data management and visualization tool that ties together third-party variant annotation databases with in-house annotations and allows Lab7 ESP users to quickly build ACMG-style reports from their VCF files. Incorporate any annotation database, including commercial ones, to leverage as much information as you need to develop your actionable reports.







LAB7 RESOURCE MANAGER: DATA PROVENANCE & SECURITY
The Lab7 ESP is designed to run in research, production, and regulated environments. In each environment, ready access to the “5 Ws and an H” of your data (who, what, when, where, why, how) is essential for increased productivity, quality assurance, and regulatory compliance.





Provenance


We track the full provenance of sequencing data, from the instrument to QC and mapping pipelines and to experiment specific analyses. Scientists have full access to the provenance chain and all the data associated with each step, enabling complex queries that allow scientists to fully explore their results.






Monitoring


The Lab7 ESP’s monitoring tools provide multiple views into in-flight analyses and workflows, giving scientists complete transparency.




Security


With our security model, scientists can control access to all aspects of their experimental environment. Fine-grained access control lists enable read, write, and execute permissions for all data and pipelines.

DashO3™


How does DashO3 work?



Provide us your analysis goals, and we provide you with a pipeline
Take an existing published analysis and create a custom pipeline
We identify computational and data flow bottlenecks in your existing pipelines and increase performance by 2-10x



Research-grade pipelines are not production-grade pipelines
Many bioinformatics pipelines that start as research projects eventually morph into production tools. Research projects, by their nature, tend to be quick and dirty implementations that get the job done. As they enter production, it is common to simply move research code to a production cluster and run it “as-is”. While this might initially work, as throughput increases, research pipelines can quickly become a computational bottleneck, limiting the turnaround time for processing samples. Of course, when this happens, the original developers might be working on new projects (or gone!) and can’t be called upon to speed things up.
We make your pipelines production-grade
The DashO3 (“dash oh-three”) program is designed to help when you need more performance from your pipelines. “-O3” is a standard compiler option that translates to: “use every technique at your disposal to make my program run fast.” We apply the same spirit to optimizing your pipelines for production. Using your existing pipelines, we leverage a collection of minimally invasive optimization methods to increase performance and meet your goals. Like using “-O3” on your individual programs, our process can often find optimizations that increase performance by 2-10x.

[White Paper] Going Beyond Commodity Cloud Services for Data-Intensive Genomic Applications
Lab 7 High-Performance Genomic Cloud Powered by IBM
As large genomic labs become even more data intensive and collaborative efforts become more geographically diverse, utilizing the cloud for analysis and storage of data is becoming advantageous over using on-premises compute resources. With the size of genomic datasets, the long-term costs associated with commodity cloud solutions such as Amazon are simply not sustainable and their infrastructures are not optimized to efficiently handle genomic-scale workloads. 
This white paper explores how a high performance computing system for genomic research paired with IBM Bluemix infrastructure cloud to provision optimized resources for storage, computing, and networking components that are designed from the start to efficiently manage and handle genomic-scale data.

Lab7 Systems, Inc. Company Profile

15:32 EDT 25th July 2017 | BioPortfolio











      Lab7 Systems is a software developer that has a vision to reduce the 
      level of hands-on data management by bioinformaticians, scientists, and 
      IT teams who are struggling with the massive amounts of next generation 
      sequencing data that are being generated. Lab7 understands there is a 
      critical need to develop a tool that will integrate the disparate and 
      often disjointed scientific software toolkit that is being used, and

Lab7 Systems Launches BioBuilds, SeqSigma, and DashO3 to Accelerate and Streamline Genomic Data Processing 


Product News   Sep 04, 2013
            
 

 

 

Lab7 Systems, Inc., announced that it has released a free software toolkit and new service offerings for the next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) bioinformatics community, along with the latest beta version of its Lab7 Dashboard.  BioBuildsTM is a reference collection of Open Source bioinformatics tools for genomics, pre-built for Linux and Mac OS X platforms.  It eliminates the need for users to maintain and build their own versions of these tools.  By providing binaries, BioBuilds also enables users to easily reproduce results by removing version dependencies on underlying software, since all tools in BioBuilds will be pre-built for those binaries."Open Source software is important for bioinformatics", said Chris Mueller, Ph.D., Lab7 Systems’ President and Chief Technology Officer.  "However, building and maintaining Open Source tools can be a time consuming process.  We maintain internal builds of many analytical tools and we feel that making our builds freely available is a good way to give back to the genomics community."BioBuilds is being released in conjunction with the second Public Beta of the Lab7 Dashboard, the company’s comprehensive software platform for managing sequencing projects, workflows, and pipelines.  This release includes the Production Pipeline Engine, a complete sequence analysis pipeline management and report generation system.  The Production Pipeline Engine allows users to easily port existing analysis pipelines into a managed, production-ready environment.  All BioBuilds tools are made readily available in the Lab7 Dashboard, even though the platform is not expressly required to run the tools.Lab7 Systems also launched its SeqSigmaTM and DashO3TM optimization processes, integral components of the company’s larger suite of custom services.  The SeqSigma process utilizes clients’ sequencing and analysis goals to design and implement cost-effective computational infrastructures that scale with their labs, while the DashO3 pipeline optimization process identifies computational and dataflow bottlenecks in sequence analysis pipelines and can increase performance by two- to tenfold.“Everything we’re launching today supports our vision of a streamlined environment for the management and analysis of NGS data,” concluded Dr. Mueller.  “With the tools we’re providing, we know that we can reduce the burden on bioinformaticians, scientists, and clinicians, allowing them to refocus their efforts to accelerate scientific discovery and clinical diagnoses.”

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."
