Judgment honed over two decades of investment experience
The Value of Experience.Crescent’s Mezzanine strategy is one of the leading independent global providers of mezzanine capital. Since 1992, Crescent's Mezzanine strategy has developed a reputation as a reliable provider of junior debt capital, primarily to fund shareholder transitions on behalf of private equity firms. We believe our reputation is a result of our extensive investment experience, broad transaction sourcing capabilities, and disciplined investment approach. Our objective is to provide investors with substantial current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of mezzanine securities. Investments generally take the form of private debt securities with equity participation in connection with buyouts, recapitalizations and refinancings.
 
Investors committed more than $4.6 billion to Crescent Mezzanine Partners VII (“Fund VII”), exceeding the initial fundraising target of $3.0 billion and representing the largest private mezzanine offering in Crescent Mezzanine’s history. Our experience investing in over 190 mezzanine transactions for 25 years is a key element to our continued success.Providing financing to private equity sponsors

FCP Free-Space Mezzanines™ will bring your industrial or commercial work space to a whole new level!



Our steel mezzanines can economically transform your unused and unproductive overhead air space into valuable floor space that works for you.  Go ahead – create a second, third or fourth level because our mezzanine systems are fully engineered for superior strength, stability and function. In addition, our easy to install modular mezzanine design easily bolts together to allow for rapid installation, future expansion or even relocation.
Free-Space Mezzanines™ aren’t just for storage! Our rigid frame design is perfect for metal buildings, conveyor support, equipment platforms, in-plant offices, manufacturing activities, walkways or stair tower. Whatever you may need to support above floor level, FCP can create the right structure. Plus, with our design and use of lightweight, high-tensile materials, we are able to install the new structure over existing equipment or stored items with a minimum of support columns thereby maximizing the usable floor space under the mezzanine.
FCP Free-Space Mezzanines™ are designed to comply with all applicable building codes: UBC, CBC and IBC; as well as meeting the rigorous specifications demanded in seismically active zones.
Codes & Specs
FCP Free-Space Mezzanine™ utilizes structural square tube columns to save space while creating superior rigidity. All components are designed to facilitate ease of installation. The high-tensile steel framing members and our rigid frame moment-connections allow greater spans and the ability to meet Seismic Zone 4 requirements.  Framing systems are designed to meet or exceed local, California and international building code standards. All FCP Free-Space Mezzanines TM follow the guidelines of the applicable code agencies ANSI, AISC, ASCE, UBC, CBC, BOCA, SBC, ADA and OSHA.
