Emil W. Henry, Jr., CEO and Managing Partner
Emil W. Henry, Jr. has had a distinguished 30-year career at the highest levels of private equity, investment management, corporate finance and public service. He is the founder, CEO and Managing Partner of Tiger Infrastructure Partners. He is also a noted author on matters of public policy and speaker on a range of financial and regulatory issues.Mr. Henry began the formative part of his career at Morgan Stanley in the mid-1980s in that firm’s merchant banking arm where he executed management buyouts for Morgan Stanley’s flagship private equity fund. From there he became an early partner of Gleacher Partners, where he served as Managing Director and Chairman of Asset Management, having co-founded and successfully overseen Gleacher's core investment activities with assets exceeding $1 billion including private equity, mezzanine debt, and pooled investments in the form of funds of hedge funds. In 2005, Mr. Henry was appointed by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Henry served as key advisor to two Treasury Secretaries on matters affecting US financial institutions, hedge funds, private equity, derivatives, counterparty risk management, clearing systems, and corporate governance. He was selected by the Secretary of the Treasury as attaché to the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (“PWG”). The PWG is the most substantive market advisory group to the President of the United States and includes the Chairs of the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Mr. Henry is recognized as one of the first senior public officials to outline publicly and prior to the financial crisis how a systemic crisis might unfold driven by Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac’s concentrated holdings of sub-prime mortgages. In addition, he led the Treasury’s efforts to establish emergency response protocols in the event of a financial crisis. These protocols were invoked in the early days of the crisis. Mr. Henry was an early leader of the Treasury’s effort to reform regulatory oversight of financial institutions which resulted in the Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure following the crisis. For his efforts and leadership, Mr. Henry received the Alexander Hamilton Award, the highest honor the Treasury can bestow upon a public official. After his public service, Mr. Henry returned to investment management as Global Head of Lehman Brothers private equity business focused on infrastructure, and also served on the private equity Management Committee. After Lehman Brothers, Mr. Henry founded Tiger Infrastructure Partners with the core group of his private equity colleagues. Mr. Henry has served on numerous for-profit and not-for-profit boards. He currently serves on the Boards of Tiger Cool Express, American Natural, Hudson Fiber Holdings, Sunlight Financial, SmartSky Networks, Easterly Government Properties, and StoneCastle Financial, and he is a member of the Investment Advisory Committee of Summit Brazil Renewables. He has represented the U.S. Treasury on the Boards of the federally chartered Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), and the National Gallery of Art. He was a member of the Advisory Board for the World Economic Forum's Globalization of Alternative Investments project. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Mr. Henry has advised numerous politicians on economic policy including, most recently, as economic advisor to the Romney presidential campaign. He is a noted public speaker and author, and he has given speeches, lectures, and televised appearances on issues including systemic risk, private equity, hedge funds, and financial institution regulation. Mr. Henry has been published in leading periodicals including the Wall St. Journal, the Financial Times, National Review, Politico and the Washington Post. Mr. Henry, an ordained minister, holds an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School and a B.A. in Economics from Yale University.

Kass: Twisted Mortgage Products Boomerang









Doug Kass




Nov 2, 2007 12:01 PM EDT













 


















































  Without mortgage equity withdrawals and in light of what appears to be a sustained high price in energy products (and other commodities, for that matter), the consumer appears very vulnerable. This is particularly true in light of the prospects for lower housing prices. As such, the coming Christmas selling season looks to be a bust.      As I have written, the burden on the nonexport domestic economy now lies squarely on the shoulders of the equity market.  As yesterday indicates, that's a slippery slope.  But one sliver of light for stocks: As one of my old bosses mentioned to me last night, all the problems I have raised must be weighed against a market that trades at only 15 times earnings, which is low historically, and within the context of a 10-year U.S. note that yields just 4.35%, which doesn't offer a very sexy alternative to stocks.
