Helping Americans work toward their financial goals and dreams



“Our mission is to guide clients throughout life’s most important financial events with service and expertise above and beyond client expectations."- David & Stacy Hefty, Co-Founders
Four Pillars of Hefty


EDUCATION 





COMMUNICATION 





HONESTY 





INTEGRITY 


EducationIt is our belief that education is a key to living the American Dream. We provide on-demand education for anyone, anywhere, at any time. Everyone deserves the opportunity to be successful and we have dedicated ourselves to providing that opportunity.
CommunicationOpen lines of communication reduce confusion and help maintain strong relationships. We strive to be the best communicators by, not only delivering information, but by listening to our clients needs and desires to help set and pursue their goals.
HonestyWe see fear and greed running rampant in the financial services industry. But at Hefty Wealth, we refuse to inflate expectations and lie about investment products to win more business. Our fee-based services align our interests with those of our clients.
IntegrityWe believe in the power of the human spirit and respect the rights of all individuals. Our only bias is toward our clients, to assist them in all of life's financial events. What Wall Street does and says has no bearing on us. We work for our clients and no one else.







We Believe…






							the American Dream is alive and well					





							that all Americans benefit from setting financial goals, developing a written plan and working with a partner toward the achievement of those goals					





							that all investment strategies work some of the time and that no investment strategy works all of the time					





							our fiduciary obligation is to our client and NOT Wall Street					





							the fear of the future and the greed of consumerism are the roadblocks to financial independence for ALL Americans					





							in the human spirit and free will					





							in the power of partnership					













FirmHistory 





OurStory 





Advantage ofIndependence 





Local and NationalResources 


Firm HistoryLike you, our co-founders David & Stacy Hefty, had their own American Dream. After working for a large national investment firm and learning the ins and outs of the brokerage world David & Stacy dreamt of a different way of helping Americans work towards achieving their financial goals. They dreamt of a team of diverse financial professionals working together and collaborating with clients and other trusted advisors such as attorneys, bankers and tax accountants. They dreamt of a long term relationship where the advice given was objective. By the summer of 2000 this dream became a reality when they left their jobs and their brokerage firm’s clients and moved three hours north to start over from scratch with nothing but their dream and each other’s support. The firm has achieved several notable accolades over the years but this has been the result of our team living out OUR BELIEF STATEMENTS.
Our StoryHefty Wealth Partners is a knowledgeable community of financial professionals who believe communication, education, honesty, and integrity are the four pillars of every successful relationship. Working as a team, our professionals simplify the demands of wealth, helping to manage all aspects of your financial life so you can spend more time on other important priorities like family or your business. We serve accomplished individuals, families, businesses, trusts, estates, corporations, and foundations seeking a committed partner to help identify and work toward achieving individual financial goals.
Advantage of IndependenceWe believe our fiduciary obligation is to our client and NOT Wall Street.  Our independence helps provide the confidence you seek to pursue financial success on your terms.
At Hefty Wealth Partners, we recognize the importance of our responsibility to provide you with prudent investment management and objective advice. As independent advisors we focus solely on serving your needs and acting in your best interest at all times. This provides you with the confidence you seek to pursue financial success on your terms.
As an independent registered investment advisory (RIA) firm we have no obligations to investment product manufacturers and no cross-sell quotas or home-office directives that may lead to conflicts of interest. Instead, we spend our time developing customized strategies for the unique challenges you face.
Local and National ResourcesHefty Wealth Partners provides you access to the resources, information and experience you require to pursue your goals with confidence. Once we know where you want to go, we put your money and our extensive resources to work to help get you there. Our commitment to communication and education ensures you remain informed about economic events, tax legislation, financial market activity and other information that may impact your financial decisions.
Our Wealth Partners are frequent guests and subject matter professionals for local and national print and broadcast media outlets. All are highly experienced in interpreting complex financial data in an effort to help their clients and the public understand the potential outcomes of specific circumstances, events and situations.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
