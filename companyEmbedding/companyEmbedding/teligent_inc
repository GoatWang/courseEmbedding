The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Our operating results in the first quarter of 2017 include $3.7 million in research and development costs, compared to $3.7 million in the same quarter in 2016.


Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled to GAAP) for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 were $4.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively.


Adjusted income per fully diluted share (as defined and reconciled to GAAP) for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 were $0.07 and $0.02, respectively.

Full Year 2017 Financial Guidance

The Company expects total revenue between $85 and $100 million for the year ending December 31, 2017.


The Company anticipates gross margin of 50% to 54% for the year ending December 31, 2017.


In order to complete all of the development work required for the 2017 filings, the Company expects to spend between 24% and 27% of total revenue in research and development by the end of 2017.  The Company intends to continue its aggressive R&D commitment in 2017 in both the U.S. and Canada.

"We are off to a strong start in 2017.  We grew revenue almost 11 percent compared to last quarter, we launched four products, and maintained our strong market presence in our existing portfolio of products,'' said Jason Grenfell-Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter, we received approval from the FDA for two ANDAs, which we plan to launch in the second quarter." 
Mr. Grenfell-Gardner continued, "We are committed to executing our TICO strategy to expand our specialty generic pharmaceutical product portfolio in the topical, injectable, complex, and ophthalmic markets.  Revenue from the Teligent portfolio of injectable and topical products increased 79% over the same quarter last year.  We now market eighteen products in the US generic topical market, another four products in the US hospital injectable market, and have thirty approved generic products in the Canadian market."
"We have 33 ANDAs on file with the US FDA and based on QuintilesIMS Health data as of February 2017, the current total addressable market of these pipeline ANDAs is estimated at approximately $2.0 billion. Significantly, 88% of this total addressable market is for products filed in Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA) Year 3 or later.  We filed one additional partnered ANDA in April 2017, which brings our total to three partnered submissions pending approval at the FDA," Mr. Grenfell-Gardner concluded.
The Company will hold a conference call at 4:15 pm ET today, Tuesday, May 2, 2017 to discuss the first quarter 2017 results.
The Company invites you to listen to the call by dialing 1-888-346-3479. International participants should call 1-412-902-4260. Canadian participants should call 1-855-669-9657.  Participants should ask to be joined into the Teligent, Inc. call.

Forward-Looking Statements
This press release includes certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, and other statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts and statements identified by words such as "plan," "believe," "continue," "should" or words of similar meaning. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations include, but are not limited to: our inability to meet current or future regulatory requirements in connection with existing or future ANDAs; our inability to achieve profitability; our failure to obtain FDA approvals as anticipated; our inability to execute and implement our business plan and strategy; the potential lack of market acceptance of our products; our inability to protect our intellectual property rights; changes in global political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory factors; and our inability to complete successfully future product acquisitions.  These statements are based on our current beliefs or expectations and are inherently subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those set forth under the caption "Risk Factors" in Teligent, Inc.'s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K,  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Teligent, Inc. does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to reporting financial information required in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Teligent is also presenting EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA which are non-GAAP financial measures. Since EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA before research and development costs are non-GAAP financial measures, they should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for consolidated statements of operations and cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Teligent's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures reported by other companies.
Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Company, is calculated as follows:
Net income (loss), plus:
Depreciation expense
Amortization of intangibles
Interest expense, net
Non-cash interest expense
Provision for income taxes
Inventory step up and acquisition costs related to acquisitions
Foreign currency exchange gain/loss
Non-cash expenses, such as share-based compensation expense, and preferred stock dividend
The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful indicator, to both Company management and investors, of the past and expected ongoing operating performance of the Company. EBITDA is a commonly used and widely accepted measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is deemed by the Company to be a useful performance indicator because it includes an add back of non-cash and non-recurring operating expenses which have little to no bearing on cash flows and may be subject to uncontrollable factors not reflective of the Company's true operational performance.
While the Company uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA before research and development costs in managing and analyzing its business and financial condition and believes these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's performance, it is open to certain shortcomings. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not take into account the impact of capital expenditures on either the liquidity or the financial performance of the Company and likewise omit share-based compensation expenses, which may vary over time and may represent a material portion of overall compensation expense.  Due to the inherent limitations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA before research and development costs, the Company's management utilizes comparable GAAP financial measures to evaluate the business in conjunction with EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and encourages investors to do likewise.
The Company also presents a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, to the show the adjusted net income when EBITDA adjustments are added back or subtracted out of the traditional GAAP reported net income (loss).  Adjusted diluted earnings per share, as defined by the Company, is equal to adjusted net income divided by the actual or anticipated diluted share count for the applicable period.
