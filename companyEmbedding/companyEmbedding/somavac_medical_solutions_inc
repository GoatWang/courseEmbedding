SOMAVAC Medical Solutions, Inc

















































































Advancing Technology. Advancing Care.




HOME

















































At SOMAVAC Medical, we are creating a medical device to help patients recover with dignity at home after major surgeries like mastectomies. Postop drains are a key part of surgical recovery, especially at home, and yet they've seen less improvement than an elbow brace. This is why we listened to surgeons, patients, caregivers, hospitalists and designed a solution that meets everyone's needs. "In 2004, I remember being in the middle of a very busy season of graduations and celebrations in my household and wanting to be part of the festivities however I found myself sidelined by the maintenance of these difficult drains. I couldn't be happier to be part of what I believe will revolutionize the way women recover from breast cancer surgery."       Michele Squires

A Memphis medical device company has raised $725,000 of seed funding almost one year after the company's founding.
SOMAVAC Medical Solutions, which designs post-surgical solutions for at-home recovery, raised the funding from two Memphis-based lead investors, Innova Memphis Inc. and MB Venture Partners, and a group of undisclosed individual investors. SOMAVAC was incorporated April 28, 2016.

"We are from Memphis and supported by Memphis," cofounder and CEO Esra Roan said of the investors.
The company will use the funds to complete product development and seek regulatory clearance for its wearable, post-surgical drainage device.




The device is expected to be available in 2018, pending U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.
The device is for patients who have surgeries that form large flaps in tissue layers. The SOMAVAC device is less than one inch thick and collects drainage stored in reservoirs. The device operates with the push of a button and generates a continual suction that brings tissue together. According to the founders, the device improves patients' experiences after major surgeries at home, where the longest portion of recovery takes place.
Last month, cofounder and chief technology officer Josh Herwig represented SOMAVAC during the Delta Showcase pitch competition at New Orleans Entrepreneur Week, during which the company won a $10,000 prize.
"It gave us a jolt," Roan said. "Proof we're going in the right direction."
Roan has been in biomedical research for 13 years and is an associate professor in biomedical engineering at the University of Memphis. Herwig has five years of product design, development and manufacturing experience.




 


The two met when Herwig was a graduate student of Roan’s. The two also share an alma mater, Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville.
SOMAVAC is a graduate of ZeroTo510, a Memphis-based medical device accelerator. They also participated in the 2016 Summer of Acceleration, a collaboration between EPIcenter, Memphis Bioworks and Start Co.
