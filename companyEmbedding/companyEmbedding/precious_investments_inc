Featured Topics






ESG Investing


Aligning Factor and ESG Views

Asset Stewardship


Fearless Girl

SSGA takes action to celebrate the power of women in leadership and to urge greater gender diversity on corporate boards. 









 


Why ESG Really Matters

ESG captures information that’s not readily available on the balance sheet or income statement, providing investors with a more complete picture.


 


The Investment Logic For Sustainability

Sustainability is clearly one of the world's most important goals. Chris McKnett argues that large institutional investors have a big role to play.


 


Asset Stewardship

We actively engage with companies on a range of important governance and sustainability issues to ensure our portfolios are appropriately focused on long-term value creation.

ABOUT PNIK

 


Precious Investments, Inc. trades in the US OTC market under the ticker symbol: PNIK.
 
PNIK started life as AAA Minerals, Inc. in 2004 and eventually morphed into AAA Energy, Inc. and then FIGO Ventures, Inc. before becoming Precious Investments, Inc.. PNIK has been either in the energy market or minerals area for all its life. As recently as 2014 PNIK (as FIGO Ventures, Inc.) was in the minerals business via their lease of a gold mine in Columbia, South America. With the down turn in gold prices the company decided to suspend its mining operation in Columbia and seek out an opportunity in the colored diamond markets.

 



OUR GROWTH

 



In order to further foster its position in the diamond trading market PNIK, via the acquisition of Karrah Inc. (Located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), has also become a Manufacturer and Wholesaler of fine jewelry, a wholesaler of fine pre-owned vintage watches and buyer of jewelry, watches and diamonds via liquidations, bankruptcies and estate sales. The plans for Karrah are to take advantage of the model where Karrah has been successful in buying liquidation and closeout merchandise and supplying to retailers/auctioneer/collectors in Toronto and Vancouver.
 
PNIK will scale the business by funding the acquisition of more merchandise in order to do the same business south of the border with American auction houses and retailers. Karrah has developed relationships with major brokers and agents or bankruptcy and closeout merchandise. Karrah has also developed manufacturing tactics that allow it to customize Swiss watches with diamonds and gems enhancing their value. These two strengths will also be leveraged and used to grow the company. The Company also sells its Jewelry and estate pieces on its web site: www.fifthand.com

 









WHY PRECIOUS GEMS?

 


Finite number of flawless and exceptional “fancy” colored diamonds above ground. Of the millions of diamonds mined each year, only 0.001% qualify as fancy colors and only a handful achieve the top quality and intense vivid colored diamonds.

 


ABOUT KASHIF KHAN

 



During August 2015 the Company entered into business with Kashif Khan a specialist in the wholesale colored diamonds and trading business.

 
Mr. Khan holds the record for both the 1st and 2nd most valuable diamonds sold at auction in Canada. During the course of his professional life he has been involved in the sale of over $200 million of gems.
 
He has also been featured on many Canadian News outlets as the leader in the sale of important diamonds in Canada. From 2012 to February 2014, he been involved in the sale of approximately 2,000 colored diamonds with an average size of one carat, boosting gross operating margins of approximately 30%.

 









WHY PRECIOUS GEMS

 


Just like the worlds art masterpieces have seen the highest value of appreciation, so do nature’s masterpieces (colored diamonds) which are being sold for top dollars and have been outperforming all major stock indices over the last 18 years. On average the value of colored diamonds have increased annually by 12%-13% and have not decreased in price at the wholesale level since 1959. 
 
The reason for colored diamonds to not only retain their value but show annual increases in value is because of the following:
 

Finite number of flawless and exceptional “fancy” colored diamonds above ground. Of the millions of diamonds mined each year, only 0.001% qualify as fancy colors and only a handful achieve the top quality and intense vivid colored diamonds.


Rio Tinto’s argyle mine produces 90%-95% of the fancy pink diamonds worldwide and is expected to close in 2020.


Colored diamond mining is a by-product of white diamond mining, not an economical primary objective for diamond miners due to its rarity;


Only three or four new mines expected to come into production over the next 5 years, none of which are expected to be a significant producer of colored diamond stones;


Demand is expected to grow beyond projected supplies;


Even if another diamond deposit with colored stones was discovered today, it would take 10 years before diamonds could be mined;


Increasing demand from China, India, Russia and continued demand from the Middle East and the US; and Buyers from outside the jewelry industry are increasingly investing their money in colored diamonds

Precious Investments Inc is Creating an Asset Based Crypto Currency – “BitGems” Backed by Its Portfolio of Colored Diamonds




















October 05, 2015 09:00 ET

 | Source: Precious Investments, Inc.






TORONTO, Oct.  05, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precious Investments Inc. (Pink Sheets:PNIK) On September 30, 2015, PNIK has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Gulf Peal Ltd. and GoNumerical Ltd. (the “Consulting Firms”).  The MOU outlines the details of creating and trading crypto currency called BitGems.  The BitGems are the first asset based Ether coin on the cyber currency market, which will be values and supported by the color diamond portfolio in PNIK.  To achieve this goal, PNIK has engaged the Consulting Firms under the terms of the MOU to develop and help with the crowdsale of BitGems crypto currency. Under the MOU, PNIK will provide an asset portfolio of colored diamonds with a total appraised retail value of $5,000,000.  The development of the BitGems crypto currency will use the next generation blockchain platform Ethereum (https://ethereum.org/).  This platform will create 5,000,000 BitGems tokens valued at $1 each to correspond with the $5,000,000 color diamond asset. The BitGems tokens will be available for sale to the general public, allowing investors to securely own part of the unique color diamond portfolio, which is assembled by the world’s experts in the color diamond market.  The proceeds from the sale of BitGems will fund PNIK’s ability to expand its purchasing power of these unique color diamonds.  The launch and the sale of BitGems will be done via various channels including proprietary website, which is being developed as part of the MOU.  The website will include a catalog of the diamonds in the portfolio, a discussion forum and a section for the BitGems crowdsale. The crowdsale section provides instructions on how crowd members are to purchase BitGems tokens. The BitGems can be traded on the various crypto currency exchanges and will provide investors option to the BitCoin. Dr. Nataliya Hearn, CEO of Precious Investments Inc. said: “We are very excited to be the first asset based ether coin (BitGems tokens) and allow people to own and trade a currency backed by a real asset.

TORONTO, Aug. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Precious Investments, Inc. (PNIK) would like to announce that Karrah Inc. has continued its success throughout the month of July.
In July, PNIK was able to confirm and acquire an additional $2.6 million at retail value, in exchange for shares, with an additional $3 million in due diligence expected to close in August. 








"Our continued success in acquiring diamonds in exchange for stock has given us the support to be able to release Precious Investments of large debt obligations," says Precious Investments, Inc. COO, Kashif Khan. "In light of the discontinuance of the crypto currency business, for which these diamonds were specifically selected, we have elected to return them and eliminate the debt burden."
Due to these efforts, PNIK cancelled $4 million in debt of their initial diamond purchase in mid 2015 in lieu of returning the same diamonds. This will allow PNIK to focus our resources on the existing wholesale business through Karrah Inc. and prepare for the upcoming 2016 Christmas jewelry buying season.
About Precious Investments Inc.
In August 2015, Precious Investments, Inc. (PNIK) entered the diamond trading business and acquired Karrah Inc., allowing PNIK to become a manufacturer and wholesaler of fine jewelry, a wholesaler of fine pre-owned vintage watches, and buyer of jewelry, watches and diamonds via liquidations, bankruptcies and estate sales. The acquisition intention was to take advantage of Karrah's successful business model in buying liquidation and closeout merchandise, and supplying to retailers, auctioneers, and collectors in Toronto and Vancouver.
Funding the acquisition of more merchandise and leveraging Karrah's two major strengths, its well developed relationships and its complex manufacturing tactics, PNIK will accelerate in growth and expand to the United States. Jewelry and estate pieces can be purchased or viewed at www.fifthand.com.

U.S. Global Investors - What's Driving Gold?


























What’s Driving Gold Today?





Cause
Effects
Possible Ramifications



Low or Negative Interest Rates
When real interest rates are low (or negative), investors turn away from paper assets with declining value and turn toward assets with real value, like gold. 
More Demand for Gold
Higher Gold Prices


Central Bank Policy
For the past several years, central banks around the world have switched from being net sellers to net buyers of gold.
Gold Viewed as Currency
Higher Gold Prices


Growth in World Money Supply
Central banks around the world are focused on stimulative monetary policies to encourage growth.
Declining Confidence in Paper Money
Higher Gold Prices


Lack of New Discoveries in Gold Mines
Gold miners have experienced increased labor costs and taxes, resulting in a higher replacement cost per ounce of gold.
Stagnant Production and Reduced Supply
Higher Gold Prices


China and India “Chindia” Have Strong Cultural Affinity for Gold
Growing middle classes in the world’s most populous countries fuel gold buying for weddings and seasonal gifts.
Increased Spending Power Correlated with Gold Buying 
Higher Gold Prices


There is no guarantee that factors described above will result in higher gold prices.

Expense ratios as stated in the most recent prospectus. The Adviser of the World Precious Minerals Fund has voluntarily limited total fund operating expenses (exclusive of acquired fund fees and expenses of 0.05%, extraordinary expenses, taxes, brokerage commissions and interest, and advisory fee performance adjustments) to not exceed 1.90%. With the voluntary expense waiver amount of 0.15%, total annual expenses after reimbursement were 1.81%. U.S. Global Investors, Inc. can modify or terminate the voluntary limit at any time, which may lower a fund’s yield or return.

Performance data quoted above is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. For a portion of periods, the fund had expense limitations, without which returns would have been lower. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund’s prospectus (e.g., short-term trading fees of 0.05%) which, if applicable, would lower your total returns. Performance quoted for periods of one year or less is cumulative and not annualized. Obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end at www.usfunds.com or 1-800-US-FUNDS. High double-digit returns are attributable, in part, to unusually favorable market conditions and may not be repeated or consistently achieved in the future.
Please consider carefully a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other important information, obtain a fund prospectus by visiting www.usfunds.com or by calling 1-800-US-FUNDS (1-800-873-8637). Read it carefully before investing. Foreside Fund Services, LLC, Distributor. U.S. Global Investors is the investment adviser.
Gold, precious metals, and precious minerals funds may be susceptible to adverse economic, political or regulatory developments due to concentrating in a single theme. The prices of gold, precious metals, and precious minerals are subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. We suggest investing no more than 5% to 10% of your portfolio in these sectors.
Diversification does not protect an investor from market risks and does not assure a profit.
The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index is a modified market capitalization weighted index comprised of publicly traded companies involved primarily in the mining for gold and silver.  The index benchmark value was 500.0 at the close of trading on December 20, 2002.
        
Morningstar Ratings are based on risk-adjusted return. The Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Past performance does not guarantee future results. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Ratingä based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
