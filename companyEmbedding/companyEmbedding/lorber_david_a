But when Mark tries to warn Henry's family, they won't believe him, leaving the terrified youngster alone to battle his jealous, menacing cousin. The stellar cast includes Wendy Crewson (Air Force One), David Hugh Kelly (Cujo and TV’s Hardcastle and McCormick) and David Morse (The Indian Runner).

GREENWICH, Conn., Jan. 28, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- FrontFour Capital Group LLC, together with its affiliates ("FrontFour"), one of the largest shareholders of OM Group, Inc. ("OM Group" or the "Company") (NYSE:   OMG) with ownership of approximately 5.7% of OM Group's outstanding shares of common stock, today announced it has delivered a formal nomination of three highly-qualified director candidates, David A. Lorber, Thomas R. Miklich and Allen A. Spizzo, for election to the board of directors of OM Group at the upcoming 2015 annual meeting of the Company's shareholders.
David A. Lorber, managing member and principal owner of FrontFour, stated, "We have clearly and publicly stated our serious concerns with OM Group's performance and have outlined a clear path to value creation through a combination of a cost-cutting opportunity of at least $50 million, the release of $30 million in working capital and a $250 million stock buyback.  By our estimate, the successful implementation of these initiatives should result in OM Group's shares trading at approximately $60 per share, which represents upside of nearly 120%.  However, the Board must be reconstituted in order to execute on these initiatives and drive accountability," continued Mr. Lorber.
"In our view, OM Group has strong underlying businesses and there is a great opportunity to unlock value for the benefit of all shareholders. We are therefore taking action to ensure that shareholders' interests are directly represented.  With improved Board oversight, OM Group will be well-positioned to execute on its expanding market opportunities, product offerings and to deliver improved margins and cash flows to its shareholders," concluded Mr. Lorber.
FrontFour is confident that its nominees will provide the Board of Directors of OM Group with the necessary experience, commitment and ownership alignment to attract broad based investor support, and that once elected, these new directors will work diligently to complete the strategic initiatives that are required at OM Group.  FrontFour is open to continuing its discussions with the Board regarding its composition and corporate strategy, and remains amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to reconstitute the Board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders.  FrontFour's Nominees are:
