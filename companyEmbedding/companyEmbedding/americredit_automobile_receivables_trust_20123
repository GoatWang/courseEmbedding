                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Assured Guaranty Corp. Insures $200 Million AmeriCredit Auto Loan Securitization






Business Wire




Mar 26, 2010 5:23 PM EDT













 


















































  Bond insurer Assured Guaranty Corp. (AGC) will provide a financial guaranty insurance policy for $200 million of Automobile Receivables Backed Notes priced today by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2010-A.  “This is the first public asset-backed transaction we have guaranteed outside of the secondary market for some time, and we look forward to increasing our participation in the resurgent ABS market.” said Paul Livingstone, Senior Managing Director for Structured Finance at AGC. “Further, we are very pleased to be working with AmeriCredit, a long-time client whose track record reflects its strong market position and experienced management.”  The issue will be collateralized by approximately $238 million of loans financing automobiles, light duty trucks and vans. In addition to the overcollateralization, investors and AGC are protected in the transaction by excess cashflow, an interest spread account and limited cross-collateralization with certain other AmeriCredit transactions.  The AGC financial guaranty insurance policy will unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee payments of interest and principal due on each insured distribution date.  AGC is a financial guaranty insurance subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, Assured Guaranty or the Company) (NYSE:AGO). Assured Guaranty is a Bermuda-based holding company that provides, through its operating subsidiaries, credit protection products to the public finance, infrastructure and structured finance markets in the United States as well as internationally. The Company applies its credit underwriting expertise, risk management skills and capital markets experience to develop insurance, reinsurance and credit derivative products. The Company's principal product is a guaranty of principal and interest payments on debt securities issued by governmental entities such as U.S. state or municipal authorities, obligations issued for international infrastructure projects, and asset-backed securities (ABS).  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements:  Any forward-looking statements made in this press release reflect the current views of Assured Guaranty with respect to future events and financial performance and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in these statements. For example, Assured Guaranty’s forward-looking statements could be affected by: (1) rating agency action, including a ratings downgrade at any time of Assured Guaranty Ltd. or any of its subsidiaries and/or of transactions insured by such subsidiaries, both of which have occurred in the past; (2) developments in the world's financial and capital markets that adversely affect issuers’ payment rates, the Company’s loss experience, its ability to cede exposure to reinsurers, its access to capital, its unrealized (losses) gains on derivative financial instruments or its investment returns; (3) changes in the world’s credit markets, segments thereof or general economic conditions; (4) more severe or frequent losses implicating the adequacy of the Company’s loss reserve; (5) the impact of market volatility on the mark-to-market of the Company’s contracts written in credit default swap form; (6) reduction in the amount of reinsurance portfolio opportunities available to the Company; (7) decreased demand or increased competition; (8) changes in applicable accounting policies or practices; (9) changes in applicable laws or regulations, including insurance and tax laws; (10) other governmental actions; (11) difficulties with the execution of the Company’s business strategy; (12) contract cancellations; (13) the Company’s dependence on customers; (14) loss of key personnel; (15) adverse technological developments; (16) the effects of mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; (17) natural or man-made catastrophes; (18) other risks and uncertainties that have not been identified at this time; (19) management's response to these factors; and (20) other risk factors identified in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which are made as of March 26, Assured Guaranty undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust, Series 2012-5; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust, Series 
      2012-5; Presale Issued
    





November 13, 2012 10:13 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to rate AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust, 
      series 2012-5 as detailed below.
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2012-5', 
      dated Nov. 13, 2012, which is available on Fitch's web site: www.fitchratings.com.
    

      Fitch expects to assign the following ratings:
    

      --$203,400,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$315,300,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$191,590,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$76,517,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94,987,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,403,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$24,803,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial 
      hard credit enhancement (CE) is consistent with 2012-4 and 2012-3, but 
      lower than 2012-2. The reserve totals 2.00% (non-declining), and initial 
      overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25% (both of the initial pool balance), 
      growing to a target of 14.25% (of the current pool balance, excluding 
      the reserve).
    

      Stronger Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      portfolio and 2009-2012 AMCAR securitizations have declined to some of 
      the lowest levels ever seen, supported by the gradual economic recovery 
      and strong used vehicle values supporting higher recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM 'BB+' and GM Financial 'BB' with 
      a Stable Rating Outlook for both. GM Financial has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results since 2010, while the overall health of GM 
      has also improved.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AmeriCredit Financial 
      Services Inc. demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, 
      underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio 
      delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance. Fitch 
      deems AFSI capable of adequately servicing this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

(c) all distributions, revenues,

whatever form, of any of the foregoing whether now owned or

Section 2.02.
Priority. The Issuer
intends the security interests in favor of the Issuer Secured
Parties to be prior to all other Liens in respect of the Spread
Account Agreement Collateral, and the Issuer shall take all actions
necessary to obtain and maintain, in favor of the Collateral Agent,
for the benefit of the Issuer Secured Parties, a first lien on and

Issuer Secured Party shall have all of the rights, remedies and
recourse with respect to the Spread Account Agreement Collateral

other applicable law in addition to, and not in limitation of, the
other rights, remedies and recourse granted to such Issuer Secured
Parties by this Agreement or any other law relating to the creation
and perfection of liens on, and security interests in, the Spread
Account Agreement Collateral.

any obligation to perform or satisfy, any term, covenant, condition
or agreement to be performed or satisfied by the Issuer under or in

obligation on any of the Issuer Secured Parties or the Collateral
Agent to perform or observe any such term, covenant, condition or

relative thereto or for any breach of any representation or
warranty on its part contained therein or made in connection
therewith, except, in each case, to the extent provided herein and
in the other Basic Documents.

Maintenance of Spread Account Agreement Collateral.

of the Collateral Agent) and all records and documents relating
thereto at the office of the Collateral Agent specified in Section
8.06 or such other address as may be approved by the Controlling
Party. The Collateral Agent shall keep all Spread Account Agreement
Collateral and related documentation in its possession

property that it is holding in its possession and from its own
general assets and shall maintain accurate records pertaining to
the Eligible Investments and Spread Account included in the Spread
Account Agreement Collateral in such a manner as shall enable the
Collateral Agent and the Issuer Secured Parties to verify the
accuracy of such recordkeeping. The Collateral Agent’s books
and records shall at all times show that the Spread Account
Agreement Collateral is held by the Collateral Agent as agent of
the Issuer Secured Parties and is not the property of the
Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent will promptly report to each
Issuer Secured Party and the Issuer any failure on its part to hold
the Spread Account Agreement Collateral as provided in this Section
2.04(a) and will promptly take appropriate action to remedy any
such failure.
 

(b) The Collateral Agent shall
permit each of the Issuer Secured Parties, or their respective duly
authorized representatives, attorneys, auditors or designees, to
inspect the Spread Account Agreement Collateral in the possession
of or otherwise under the control of the Collateral Agent pursuant
hereto at such reasonable times during normal business hours as any
such Issuer Secured Party may reasonably request upon not less than
two Business Day’s prior written notice. The costs and
expenses associated with any such inspection will be paid by the
party making such inspection.
 

(c) All Spread Account Agreement
Collateral shall be transferred to the Collateral Agent on behalf
of the Issuer Secured Party in a manner consistent with the
definition of “ Delivery” set forth in the Sale and
Servicing Agreement.
 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Collateral Agent: (i) is and will be acting on
behalf of the Issuer Secured Parties as a securities intermediary
under Article Eight of the UCC and acknowledges that it holds the
Spread Account Agreement Collateral for the benefit of the Issuer
Secured Parties for purposes of Section 9-313 of the UCC (ii) shall
establish and maintain the Spread Account for the benefit of the
Issuer Secured Parties as a holder of a security interest in the
Spread Account Agreement Collateral and the Spread Account; (iii)
shall treat all of the assets in the Spread Account (other than
cash) as financial assets under Article Eight of the UCC; (iv)
shall not hold, or exercise control (within the meaning of Article
Eight or Nine of the UCC) over, the Spread Account Agreement
Collateral and/ or the Spread Account for the benefit of any person
or entity other than the Issuer Secured Parties; (v) has received
notice of the Issuer Secured Parties’ interest in the assets
contained and/or to be contained in the Spread Account; and (vi)
shall take instructions only from the Issuer Secured Party
constituting the Controlling Party hereunder (without any consent
of and notwithstanding any alternate direction of the Issuer) with
respect to the Spread Account
 
11




and/or the Spread Account Agreement
Collateral, including, without limitation, all instructions with
respect to the acquisition, transfer and disposition of assets in
the Spread Account and the proceeds thereof. In accordance with the
choice of law governing this Agreement set forth in Section 8.14
herein, for purposes of Article Eight of the UCC the jurisdiction
of the Collateral Agent is deemed to be New York.
 

Section 2.05. Termination and
Release of Rights.
 

(a) On the Insurer Termination Date,
the rights, remedies, powers, duties, authority and obligations
conferred upon the Insurer pursuant to this Agreement in respect of
the Spread Account Agreement Collateral shall terminate and be of
no further force and effect and all rights, remedies, powers,
duties, authority and obligations of the Insurer with respect to
such Spread Account Agreement Collateral shall be automatically
released; provided that any indemnity provided to or by the Insurer
herein shall survive such Insurer Termination Date. If the Insurer
is acting as Controlling Party on the related Insurer Termination
Date, the Insurer agrees, at the expense of the Issuer, to execute
and deliver such instruments as the successor Controlling Party may
reasonably request to effectuate such release, and any such
instruments so executed and delivered shall be fully binding on the
Insurer and any Person claiming by, through or under the
Insurer.
 

(b) On the Trustee Termination Date,
the rights, remedies, powers, duties, authority and obligations, if
any, conferred upon the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of the Spread Account Agreement Collateral shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect and all such rights,
remedies, powers, duties, authority and obligations of the Trustee
with respect to such Spread Account Agreement Collateral shall be
automatically released; provided that any indemnity provided to the
Trustee herein shall survive such Trustee Termination Date. If the
Trustee is acting as Controlling Party on the related Trustee
Termination Date, the Trustee agrees, at the expense of the Issuer,
to execute and deliver such instruments as the Issuer may
reasonably request to effectuate such release, and any such
instruments so executed and delivered shall be fully binding on the
Trustee.
 

(c) On the Final Termination Date,
the rights, remedies, powers, duties, authority and obligations
conferred upon the Collateral Agent and each Issuer Secured Party

force and effect and all rights, remedies, powers, duties,
authority and obligations of the Collateral Agent and each Issuer
Secured Party with respect to the Spread Account Agreement
Collateral shall be automatically released. On the Final
Termination Date, the Collateral Agent agrees, and each Issuer
Secured Party agrees, at the expense of the Issuer, to execute such
instruments of release, in recordable
 
12




form if necessary, in favor of the
Issuer as the Issuer may reasonably request, to deliver any Spread
Account Agreement Collateral in its possession to the Issuer, and
to otherwise release the lien of this Agreement and release and
deliver to the Issuer the Spread Account Agreement
Collateral.
 

Section 2.06. Non-Recourse
Obligations of Issuer. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the other
Basic Documents to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the
obligations of the Issuer hereunder shall be recourse only to the
extent of amounts released to the Issuer pursuant to Section
3.03(b)(ii) and retained by the Issuer in accordance with the next
sentence. The Issuer agrees that it shall not declare or make any
payment to the Seller or AmeriCredit except in accordance with the
Basic Documents. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit
the rights of the Noteholders under any other Basic
Document.

the Collateral Agent shall establish, at its office or at another
depository institution or trust company an Eligible Deposit
Account, designated, “ Spread Account—Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as Collateral Agent for XL Capital Assurance
Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee and
Trust Collateral Agent Re: AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust
2005-A-X, Class A Asset-Backed Notes Series 2005-A-X” (the
“Spread Account”). The Spread Account shall be
maintained by the Collateral Agent at all times separate and apart
from any other account of AmeriCredit, the Seller, the Servicer or
the Issuer. The Spread Account shall be maintained at the same
depository institution (which depository institution may be changed
from time to time in accordance with this Agreement). If the Spread
Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, the Collateral
Agent shall notify the Controlling Party of such fact and shall
establish within five Business Days of such determination, in
accordance with Section 3.04(a), a successor Spread Account
thereto, which shall be an Eligible Deposit Account, at another
depository institution acceptable to the Controlling
Party.
 

(b) No withdrawals may be made of
funds in the Spread Account except as provided in Section 3.03.
Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, funds in the
Spread Account shall not be commingled with any other moneys. All
moneys deposited from time to time in the Spread Account and all
investments made with such moneys shall be held by the Collateral
Agent as part of the Spread Account Agreement

Distribution Date, the Collateral Agent shall cause to be
maintained in the Spread Account an amount equal to the Requisite
Amount in accordance with Article V of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement. Any amounts deposited with respect to the Cash
Collateral Deposit shall not be included for the purposes of
determining whether the amount maintained in the Spread Account
equals the Requisite Amount
 

Section 3.02.
Investments.
 

(a) Funds which may at any time be
held in the Spread Account shall be invested and reinvested by the
Collateral Agent, at the written direction (which may include,
subject to the provisions hereof, general standing instructions) of
the Issuer (unless a Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
in which case at the written direction of the Controlling Party if
it so elects) or its designee received by the Collateral Agent by
1:00 p.m. New York City time, on the Business Day prior to the date
on which such investment shall be made, in one or more Eligible
Investments in the manner specified in Section 3.02(b) and (c). If
no written direction with respect to any portion of such Spread
Account is received by the Collateral Agent, the Spread Account
Agreement Collateral Agent shall invest such funds overnight in
money market mutual funds described in paragraph (d) of the
definition of the term “Eligible Investments,” provided
that the Collateral Agent shall not be liable for any loss or
absence of income resulting from such investments.
 

(b) Each investment made pursuant to
this Section on any date shall mature not later than the Business
Day immediately preceding the Distribution Date next succeeding the
day such investment is made or payable on demand, provided that any
investment of funds in the Spread Account maintained with the
Collateral Agent in any investment as to which the Collateral Agent
is the obligor, if otherwise qualified as an Eligible Investment
may mature on the Distribution Date next succeeding the date of
such investment.
 

(c) Subject to the other provisions
hereof, the Collateral Agent shall have sole control over each such
investment and the income thereon, and any certificate or other
instrument evidencing any such investment, if any, shall be
delivered directly to the Collateral Agent or its agent, together
with each document of transfer, if any, necessary to transfer
title
 
14




to such investment to the Collateral
Agent in a manner which complies with Section 2.04 and the
requirements of the definition of “Eligible
Investments.”
 

(d) If amounts on deposit in the
Spread Account are at any time invested in an Eligible Investment
payable on demand, the Collateral Agent shall (i) consistent with
any notice required to be given thereunder, demand that payment
thereon be made on the last day such Eligible Investment is
permitted to mature under the provisions hereof and (ii) demand
payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon receipt of
written notice from the Controlling Party to the effect that such
investment does not constitute an Eligible Investment.
 

(e) All moneys on deposit in the
Spread Account, together with any deposits or securities in which
such moneys may be invested or reinvested, and any gains from such
investments, shall constitute Spread Account Agreement Collateral
hereunder subject to the Security Interests of the Issuer Secured
Parties.
 

(f) Subject to Section 4.03, the
Collateral Agent shall not be liable by reason of any insufficiency
in amounts on deposit in the Spread Account resulting from any loss
on any Eligible Investment included therein except for losses
attributable to the Collateral Agent’s failure to make
payments on Eligible Investments as to which the Collateral Agent,
in its commercial capacity, is obligated. All income or loss on
investments of funds in the Spread Account shall be reported by
AmeriCredit as taxable income or loss.

effect to any withdrawals pursuant to subsection (b) but prior to
any deposit in accordance with Section 3.07), and if such excess
exists, determine the amount to be claimed from each Related Series
Spread Account in accordance with Section 3.07; and
 

(viii) determine the amounts to be
on deposit in the Spread Account on such Distribution Date which
will be available to satisfy any Related Series Spread Account
Claim Amount, any Related Series Accelerated Payment Amount
