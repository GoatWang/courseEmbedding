We make the complex simple.
  Trax Technologies, Inc., has solved a problem in the logistics industry costing the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars. Logistics transactions are inherently inefficient and risky because important information is often incomplete, inaccurate or inconsistent for buyers and sellers of logistics services. Unlike current industry products, Trax doesn’t just identify bad invoices but fixes bad data at its root. Trax solves these problems through technology and services for both buyers and sellers of logistics services. Trax offers a cloud platform that assures logistics data can be trusted. Trax also provides companies with accurate insights through predictive analytics. It uses big data technologies to leverage Trax’s one-of-a-kind repository of over 1 billion logistics transactions from all industries, modes and countries to help businesses tune their operations for optimal results. These transformative breakthroughs are made possible by our employees who are some of the most innovative in their fields. If you are among the best and brightest - interested in a global career that will test, stretch and inspire you and you want to be part of transforming a $4.2 trillion industry - welcome to Trax!



FPS

sql sql-server software-engineering software-design testing

Our Freight Payment System (FPS)  enables shippers to audit freight invoices, process and pay freight bills, and manage freight costs. It can manage such processes anywhere in the world through an Internet connection, regardless of local language, currency, tax structure, legal or regulatory environment. Because Trax hosts and maintains both the hardware and software for Trax FPS, shippers can implement the system quickly and cost-effectively, without needing much help from their busy information technology (or IT) group.

Logistics Big Data Refinery Grows its Business Strategy with Key Hire




Trax Technologies Attracts Veteran Logistics Innovator to its Team of 
      Experts






October 20, 2014 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Trax Technologies has hired veteran business process innovator Dean 
      Hahn-Carlson to be its new Director of Global Product Strategy. 
      Hahn-Carlson has been engaged in defining and implementing product 
      strategy for over 30 years across a broad range of industries, including 
      distribution, financial services, manufacturing, retail and logistics.
    


      “Dean brings years of experience to Trax in the logistics space; his 
      focus, understanding and vision around logistics data will greatly 
      strengthen our 
      team,” said Trax CEO Scott Nelson, “Dean has the practical 
      experience which will allow our product organization to continue to 
      scale as we increase our investments in data refinery development.”
    

      Most recently, Hahn-Carlson managed and defined the core business 
      architecture of PowerTrack, U.S. Bank’s global, SaaS, financial supply 
      chain management network, enabling the network to grow from a concept to 
      managing tens of billions of dollars of payments annually.
    

      Hahn-Carlson believes Trax is uniquely positioned to solve the problem 
      of bad 
      logistics data - a problem that costs the transportation industry 
      hundreds of billions of dollars a year. The cost arises from 
      inefficiency, uncontrolled financial risk, distorted financial reporting 
      and sub-optimal decision making.
    

      “Trax is focused on solving a core 
      problem for the transportation industry - poor data quality - 
      freeing customers to focus their attention to growing their business 
      instead of trying to figure out how to claw usable information out of 
      bad data,” said Hahn-Carlson.
    

      Trax provides a data refinery that serves both buyers 
      and sellers of logistics services. The raw logistics data that comes 
      to Trax from multiple sources is often inaccurate, incomplete or 
      inconsistent. Trax refines the data, making it safe and accurate.
    

      “What attracted me to Trax is the focus on enhancing data quality,” said 
      Hahn-Carlson. “High quality data can be used as the foundation for multiple 
      products focused on logistics network optimization, landed cost 
      analysis, buyer/supplier collaboration, payments, supply chain finance 
      and more.”
    

      Trax has been experiencing substantial growth and was recently 
      recognized by Inc. 
      Magazine as one of the fastest 
      growing private companies. Trax operates offices in the U.S., 
      Europe, Asia and Latin America.
