Multistage Unlimited technology is a more efficient and more economical alternative to plug- and-perf and ball-sleeve frac systems, both of which are brute-force methods that bullhead fluids down the casing, with no feedback about formation response at the frac zone, no recourse in the event of a screenout, and no way to manage water and chemical consumption. Both methods do, however, have a huge appetite for pumping horsepower. Read more

 
Where do the fracs go? The quest for the most efficient field frac network
The key to maximum reservoir drainage is a systematic drilling pattern and an efficient field frac network that achieves maximum connectivity to the reservoir. This requires as many wells as possible on a given acreage, and as many stages per well as possible, without communication between stages and between wells. To achieve this, frac spacing must be exact and frac dimensions must be uniform. Unfortunately, it is impossible to achieve either consistent frac spacing or uniform frac volume using plug-and-perforate or open-hole packers and ball-drop sleeves. Read more

 
Casing sleeves and annular fracs for fast, efficient completions
The Multistage Unlimited casing sleeve/annular frac system combines resettable frac isolation with our exclusive GripShift casing sleeves to deliver fast, economical, and effective multistage completions. Unlimited stages and spacing, real-time frac-zone pressure, 5 minutes between fracs, and no drillouts. Read more  Watch full video

 
Half-Straddle option for low-rate fracs
In formations with thin reservoirs and water-bearing zones nearby, it is usually best to complete with a large number of stages and smaller fracs to avoid the water. These smaller fracs—typically 10 bpm or less—can be pumped through the coiled tubing, rather than down the coiled tubing/casing annulus. The Multistage Unlimited Half-Straddle plus casing-sleeve option is ideal for these completions. Read more

 
Interventionless toe sleeve
The Multistage Unlimited toe sleeve is the surest, simplest way to achieve initial formation access for multistage completions. Its delayed opening sequence allows an extended casing test before initial injection. Read more

 
Multistage completions using sand-jet perforating
If a well is already cased, Multistage Unlimited Mongoose technology can still provide significant economic, environmental, and operational advantages over plug & perf and ball-sleeve systems. Instead of casing sleeves, the Mongoose system uses sand-jet perforating to gain access to the formation at each stage. Sand-jet perforating works in both horizontal and vertical wellbores, either cemented or uncemented. Read more

Multistage Unlimited Frac Systems Overview
 
Casing sleeves with annular fracs
Multistage Unlimited technology is a more efficient and more economical alternative to plug-and-perf and ball-sleeve frac systems. It combines GripShift casing sleeves a resettable frac plug that runs on coiled tubing. The frac plug isolates the target zone and grips the casing sleeve so that it can be shifted with surface pressure. Fracs are pumped down the coiled tubing/casing annulus. Read More
Casing sleeves with thru-CT frac (Half-Straddle option)
In formations with thin reservoirs and water-bearing zones nearby, it is usually best to complete with a large number of stages and smaller fracs to avoid the water. These smaller fracs—typically 10 bpm or less to control frac growth—can be pumped through the coiled tubing, rather than down the coiled tubing/casing annulus. This system uses casing sleeves and resettable frac plug, just like our annular frac system (above) and is called the Half-Straddle option, because it resembles a coiled-tubing straddle with only a lower seal. Read More
Sand-jet perforating with annular fracs
The Multistage Unlimited Mongoose system is the simplest multistage completion technology in the field. It requires no casing sleeves, no perforating guns, and no pumpdown plugs or sand plugs. It uses our exclusive resettable frac plug to isolate stages and high-velocity abrasive slurry to cut perforations. Fracs are pumped down the coiled-tubing/casing annulus. The Mongoose system is typically used with cemented completions. Although it requires more time per stage than our Multistage Unlimited casing-sleeve systems, it is a practical option when wells are already cased or when completion economics and design dictate. Read More
Straddle refrac system
The Multistage Unlimited ReFrac™ System is the fast, cost-effective way to restimulate older wells and newer wells that were insufficiently stimulated when completed. It has been proven that plug-and-perf completions do not stimulate all perforation clusters equally—some perforations often are not treated at all. The ReFrac frac-through-coil system isolates and effectively stimulates all the under-performing stages in a well in a single trip. Read More

Controlled optimization is true optimization
To truly optimize a multistage completion design for a given field and formation, you need a systematic completion approach that allows you to make well-to-well comparisons with confidence. You need consistent, repeatable frac delivery plus measured downhole data that helps you better understand the formation, the well, and the stimulation.
Watch Optimization: Plug & Perf vs NCS Multistage Unlimited Pinpoint Fracturing.
That means you can’t truly optimize conventional plug-and-perf completions and open-hole-packer/ball-drop-sleeve completions, because you don’t know how many fracs are created, where they are, and how much proppant goes into each one. Even if you did know, you couldn’t reproduce the completion because, with highly variable formation breakdown pressures, you have little or no control over where the fracs and proppant actually go. And you don’t get any downhole data unless you deploy a costly monitoring system.
A conceptual sketch of a field frac network using an older completion method, showing unstimulated reservoir resulting from uncontrolled frac spacing and frac dimensions. Technical References: URTeC 1571745; SPE 144326; SPE 163820; SPE 169574; SPE 174943 The goal of optimization is a field frac network that has the maximum number of stages without interzone communication and the maximum frac dimensions without bashing other wells or unintentionally poaching other formations. The only way to achieve this is pinpoint fracturing.
With the Multistage Unlimited®pinpoint-frac system, you know where fracs initiate and exactly how much proppant you put in each one. No matter what else you adjust—frac spacing, frac dimensions, proppant type, frac fluid, injection rates, proppant concentration—frac placement remains predictable and repeatable from well to well, so you can evaluate the effects of any design changes you make. 
Recorded downhole data describes every frac
At every stage, the Multistage Unlimited frac-isolation assembly records actual pressures and temperatures at the frac zone and in the wellbore below (see chart below). Two proprietary, high-resolution gauge/recorders—one above the bridge plug and one below—measure and record pressure, temperature, and forces acting on the tool string during a completion. Stage-by-stage details give you insights you don’t get with older completion technologies. 
Use recorded pressures to optimize stage spacing
Post-completion analysis of the data reveals both the presence and type of any interzone communication (natural fractures, cement failure, longitudinal frac), so you can establish minimum frac spacing in a given formation. The data also identifies the presence and source of near-wellbore restrictions as well as proppant bridging when it occurs.
Actual pressure and temperature data from a single Multistage Unlimited frac stage. The pressure readings confirm isolation from the stage below. Temperature readings show the cooling effect of the frac fluid.
 
Use recorded pressures to improve frac modeling
Recorded pressures at the frac zone (no pipe friction guesswork) permit better pressure history matching for calibrating rock properties, enabling more accurate frac modeling and reservoir simulation.
Use actual bottom-hole temperatures to optimize crosslinkers and breakers
As a bonus, recorded temperatures in and below the frac zone enable better crosslinker and breaker design and testing, using actual downhole warm-up and cool-down measurements instead of guesstimates.
Use deadleg pressure to optimize fracs from stage-to-stage
You can start optimizing during the completion by watching bottom-hole pressure in real time via the coiled tubing deadleg and adjusting pad size, sand concentration and ramp, and pump rates from stage to stage as you move up the wellbore, based on actual formation response. You can also be very aggressive without fear of screening out, because circulation will remove excess proppant very quickly so you can get right back to work.

First Quarter Highlights

Record 17,418 sliding sleeves sold for the quarter
Revenue of $58.6 million, net income of $6.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.18
Adjusted EBITDA of $19.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33%
Purchased 50% ownership interest in Repeat Precision, LLC

HOUSTON, May  15, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NCS Multistage Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:NCSM) ("NCS" or the "Company"), a leading provider of highly engineered products and support services that facilitate the optimization of oil and natural gas well completions and field development strategies, today announced its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Financial Review
NCS completed its initial public offering of its common stock on May 3, 2017, and the first quarter of 2017 represents a period during which the Company was privately-owned.
During the first quarter of 2017, the Company sold 17,418 sliding sleeves, an increase of 145% as compared to the first quarter of 2016. The Company also participated in the completion of 466 wells during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 82% as compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Revenues were $58.6 million for the quarter, an increase of $35.5 million, or 154% as compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the sale of our completions products and services due to higher drilling and well completion activity as a result of an improved commodity price environment in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016.
Net income was $6.3 million, or $0.18 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. This compares to a net loss of $(8.1) million, or $(0.24) diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA was $19.2 million for the quarter, an increase of $16.5 million as compared to the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 33%, as compared to 12% for the first quarter of 2016.
Purchase of 50% Interest in Repeat Precision
On February 1, 2017, the Company purchased a 50% interest in Repeat Precision, LLC ("Repeat") for $5.9 million. The Company also recorded an earn-out as a contingent adjustment to the asset purchase price in the amount of $7.0 million. Repeat is a provider of machining services for the Company and other third-party customers, primarily in the oil and gas industry. In addition, Repeat sells products to oilfield services companies and oil and gas companies on a wholesale basis. The Company consolidates Repeat for accounting purposes.
Capital Expenditures and Liquidity
The Company spent $1.5 million in capital expenditures, net, during the first quarter of 2017. These expenditures were made to support the growth of the business, including certain investments made by Repeat to increase sliding sleeve production capacity.
As of March 31, 2017, the Company had $12.0 million in cash, total availability under its revolving credit facility of $20.0 million and $89.9 million in total debt of which $88.7 million was indebtedness under our credit facility. The total availability and the amount outstanding under our credit facility as of March 31, 2017 does not give effect to the use of proceeds from our initial public offering. On May 4, 2017, we used a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering to repay all outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility and entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that provides for a $50.0 million revolving facility.
NCS's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Nipper, commented, "I'm proud of all of our employees whose efforts resulted in a strong start to 2017, including an NCS record of over 17,400 sliding sleeves sold during the quarter. This performance speaks to the value that we deliver to our customers, the strength of our technology and the capabilities of our supply chain. We are excited to be hosting our first earnings call as a publicly-traded company. We are very pleased with the success of our recent IPO and the financial flexibility we have in place to support the future growth of NCS. I thank our management team, employees and advisors for their contributions to that significant achievement for the Company."

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For an explanation of these measures and a reconciliation, refer to "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information—Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin" below.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION - ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN


(In thousands) 


(Unaudited)


 
 


Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 


 
 


EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance or which, in the case of share-based compensation, are non-cash in nature. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure that excludes many of the costs associated with our existing capital structure and excludes costs that management believes do not reflect our ongoing operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that management uses to assess the period-to-period performance of our core business operations. We believe that presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin enables investors to assess our performance from period to period using the same metric utilized by management and to evaluate our performance relative to other companies that are not subject to such factors.


 
 


EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), are not measures of net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and are subject to important limitations. Our use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry and are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial performance as reported under GAAP and they should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as measures of our liquidity.


 
 


The table below sets forth reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable measure of financial performance calculated under GAAP:
