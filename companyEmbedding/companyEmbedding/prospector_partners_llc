PROSPECTUS







Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund and Prospector Opportunity Fund are a separate series of Prospector Funds, Inc. an opened end no load mutual fund family that offers separate investment portfolios.
Prospector Partners Asset Management, LLC ("PPAM"), located in Guilford, Connecticut, is the Funds' investment manager. PPAM is registered as an investment adviser.
Please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company. The funds objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered and read carefully before investing. You may also obtain a hard copy of the prospectus by calling 1-877-734-7862.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investing in the Prospector Funds involves special risks, including but not limited to, risks associated with investing in small and mid size companies, value investing, debt securities, foreign securities, restricted securities, and derivatives. Please refer to the prospectus for further details.
The Prospector Funds are offered to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of any Prospector Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Prospector Capital Appreciation Fund was rated 3-Stars and 3-Stars against the following numbers of Allocation--70% to 85% Equity funds over the following time periods: 334 and 291 funds in the last three- and five-year period respectively. The Prospector Opportunity Fund was rated 5-Stars and 3-Stars against the following numbers of Mid Cap Value funds over the following time periods: 356 and 310 funds in the last three and five-year periods respectively.
