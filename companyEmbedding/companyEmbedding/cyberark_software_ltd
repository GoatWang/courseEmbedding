History[edit]
CyberArk was founded in Israel in 1999 by Alon N. Cohen and current CEO Udi Mokady,[3] a 2014 EY Entrepreneur Of The Year,[4] who assembled a team of security engineers who implemented the digital vault technology (U.S. Patent 6,356,941). This technology (also known as network vault, and branded as The Digital Vault) surrounds data with eight layers of security within an existing network perimeter, creating a central repository to share and store proprietary or confidential data. Digital Vault still serves as a foundation for CyberArk's privileged account security solutions.[5]
In June 2014, CyberArk filed for an IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, listing 2013 revenues of $66.2 million.[6] CyberArk became a public company the same year, trading on the NASDAQ as CYBR.[7] In 2015, CyberArk announced plans to acquire the privately held Massachusetts-based company Viewfinity which specialized in privilege management and application control software. The deal was intended to help CyberArk offer more complete security solutions.[8]
Products[edit]
The company rebranded its product portfolio as CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution in 2014.[9] The modular software package includes features that secure, manage and monitor privileged accounts across OT/SCADA environments, either on-premises or in the cloud. Components in the package can be utilized singly or in combination to manage operating systems, databases, applications, hypervisors, network devices, or security appliances. Products include:

Enterprise Password Vault to protect privileged credentials.
Privileged Session Manager to isolate, control, and monitor user access as well as activities for critical UNIX, Linux, and Windows-based systems, databases, and virtual machines.
Privileged Threat Analytics to analyze user behavior and alert incident response teams about malicious activity.
Application Identity Manager to eliminate hard-coded credentials such as passwords or encryption keys from applications, service accounts or scripts.
On-Demand Privileges Manager to control and continuously monitor the commands super-users run.
SSH Key Manager to securely store, rotate and control access to SSH keys to protect privileged accounts.
Endpoint Privilege Manager to detect and block credential theft attempts by malicious users and applications.

History[edit]
CyberArk was founded in Israel in 1999 by Alon N. Cohen and current CEO Udi Mokady,[3] a 2014 EY Entrepreneur Of The Year,[4] who assembled a team of security engineers who implemented the digital vault technology (U.S. Patent 6,356,941). This technology (also known as network vault, and branded as The Digital Vault) surrounds data with eight layers of security within an existing network perimeter, creating a central repository to share and store proprietary or confidential data. Digital Vault still serves as a foundation for CyberArk's privileged account security solutions.[5]
In June 2014, CyberArk filed for an IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, listing 2013 revenues of $66.2 million.[6] CyberArk became a public company the same year, trading on the NASDAQ as CYBR.[7] In 2015, CyberArk announced plans to acquire the privately held Massachusetts-based company Viewfinity which specialized in privilege management and application control software. The deal was intended to help CyberArk offer more complete security solutions.[8]
Products[edit]
The company rebranded its product portfolio as CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution in 2014.[9] The modular software package includes features that secure, manage and monitor privileged accounts across OT/SCADA environments, either on-premises or in the cloud. Components in the package can be utilized singly or in combination to manage operating systems, databases, applications, hypervisors, network devices, or security appliances. Products include:

Enterprise Password Vault to protect privileged credentials.
Privileged Session Manager to isolate, control, and monitor user access as well as activities for critical UNIX, Linux, and Windows-based systems, databases, and virtual machines.
Privileged Threat Analytics to analyze user behavior and alert incident response teams about malicious activity.
Application Identity Manager to eliminate hard-coded credentials such as passwords or encryption keys from applications, service accounts or scripts.
On-Demand Privileges Manager to control and continuously monitor the commands super-users run.
SSH Key Manager to securely store, rotate and control access to SSH keys to protect privileged accounts.
Endpoint Privilege Manager to detect and block credential theft attempts by malicious users and applications.

What happened with CyberArk Software this quarter? 
Revenue jumped 25% year over year to $64.4 million, driven by a 23% rise in license revenue to $40.8 million and a 28% increase in maintenance and professional services revenue to $23.6 million.
"We closed over 200 new logos in the fourth quarter alone, ending the year with more than 3,075 customers, an increase from about 2,500 last year," said Chairman and CEO Udi Mokady during a conference call with analysts. "With our customer additions, more than 25% of the Global 2000 and about half of the Fortune 100 are trusting CyberArk to help protect their most valuable assets."
CyberArk also continues to display solid profitability, with non-GAAP operating income -- which excludes share-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses, and certain other items -- leaping 28% to $19.4 million. Non-GAAP net income, however, rose only 7% to $14.7 million, mostly due to larger tax payments compared to the year-ago quarter. And non-GAAP EPS, which was impacted by a higher share count, increased 5% to $0.39.
"CyberArk had an incredible 2016," said Mokady in a press release. "We outperformed across revenue, operating income and net income per share, demonstrating the ongoing execution of our land and expand strategy and the power of our operating model."





Looking forward
For the first quarter, CyberArk expects revenue of $57 million to $58 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 22% to 24%. Non-GAAP operating income and EPS are forecast to be in the ranges of $9.9 million to $10.7 million and $0.21 to $0.23, respectively.
CyberArk also issued a financial outlook for 2017, including:

Total revenue of $267 million to $270 million, up 23% to 25% year over year
Non-GAAP operating income of $56 million to $58 million, down 3% to flat versus 2016
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.24, down 5% to down 2% year over year

The lower operating and EPS estimates reflect the heavy investments CyberArk plans to make to expand its business in the coming year, as explained by CFO Josh Siegel during the company's earnings call:

In 2017, we plan to continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure to support the scale of Endpoint Privilege Manager, implementation and training service to help speed the deployment of our software, sales and marketing headcount to capture market share and grow our business, and R&D to continue to deliver innovative products to market. ... Given the scale of our business, our growth rates, demand for our solution and our market opportunity, we believe it is in the best long-term interest of the company and our shareholders to continue to invest in capturing market share and extending our leadership position.

These investments also reflect management's optimism toward the opportunities that lie ahead for CyberArk.
"Protecting privileged accounts, across the enterprise, on endpoints, in the cloud and in hybrid environments, is increasingly recognized as fundamental to cyber security programs," added Mokady. "Because of our operational and financial success in 2016, we entered 2017 as an even stronger company, well positioned to continue to deliver profitable revenue growth."

History[edit]
CyberArk was founded in Israel in 1999 by Alon N. Cohen and current CEO Udi Mokady,[3] a 2014 EY Entrepreneur Of The Year,[4] who assembled a team of security engineers who implemented the digital vault technology (U.S. Patent 6,356,941). This technology (also known as network vault, and branded as The Digital Vault) surrounds data with eight layers of security within an existing network perimeter, creating a central repository to share and store proprietary or confidential data. Digital Vault still serves as a foundation for CyberArk's privileged account security solutions.[5]
In June 2014, CyberArk filed for an IPO with the Securities and Exchange Commission, listing 2013 revenues of $66.2 million.[6] CyberArk became a public company the same year, trading on the NASDAQ as CYBR.[7] In 2015, CyberArk announced plans to acquire the privately held Massachusetts-based company Viewfinity which specialized in privilege management and application control software. The deal was intended to help CyberArk offer more complete security solutions.[8]
Products[edit]
The company rebranded its product portfolio as CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution in 2014.[9] The modular software package includes features that secure, manage and monitor privileged accounts across OT/SCADA environments, either on-premises or in the cloud. Components in the package can be utilized singly or in combination to manage operating systems, databases, applications, hypervisors, network devices, or security appliances. Products include:

Enterprise Password Vault to protect privileged credentials.
Privileged Session Manager to isolate, control, and monitor user access as well as activities for critical UNIX, Linux, and Windows-based systems, databases, and virtual machines.
Privileged Threat Analytics to analyze user behavior and alert incident response teams about malicious activity.
Application Identity Manager to eliminate hard-coded credentials such as passwords or encryption keys from applications, service accounts or scripts.
On-Demand Privileges Manager to control and continuously monitor the commands super-users run.
SSH Key Manager to securely store, rotate and control access to SSH keys to protect privileged accounts.
Endpoint Privilege Manager to detect and block credential theft attempts by malicious users and applications.

					Full Description



CyberArk Software Ltd., incorporated on February 28, 1996, is a provider of information technology (IT) security solutions that protects organizations from cyber-attacks. The Company's software solutions are focused on protecting privileged accounts, which have become a critical target in the lifecycle of cyber-attacks. The Company's Privileged Account Security Solution consists of various products, such as Enterprise Password Vault, SSH Key Manager, Privileged Session Manager, Privileged Threat Analytics, Application Identity Manager, Endpoint Privilege Manager and On-Demand Privileges Manager. The Company's products provide protection against external and internal cyber threats and enabling real-time detection and neutralization of attacks.The Company's Enterprise Password Vault provides customers with a tool to manage and protect all privileged accounts across an entire organization, including physical, virtual or cloud-based assets. Its SSH Key Manager product securely stores, rotates and controls access to SSH keys to prevent unauthorized access to privileged accounts. This includes the protection of keys at rest and in transit, granular access controls and integration with strong authentication solutions. SSH Key Manager is a logical extension to its Privileged Account Security Solution, leveraging its shared technology platform infrastructure, enabling organizations to protect all privileged credentials with a single integrated platform.The Company's Privileged Session Manager protects IT assets, including servers, applications, databases and hypervisors from malware and provides command-level monitoring and recording of all privileged activity. Privileged Session Manager prevents malware on an infected workstation from capturing a privileged credential and spreading to additional assets. It also provides a single point of control, forcing all privileged access to pass through its server, ensuring that all privileged activity is monitored and recorded. The single point of control also allows for real-time viewing of privileged activities, enabling customers to terminate privileged sessions in real-time as a threat is detected. In addition, Privileged Session Manager records complete privileged sessions and stores the recordings in the Digital Vault to prevent tampering. Auditors, forensics team and others are able to view and search through an entire session recording for specific activities.The Company's Privileged Threat Analytics product allows organizations to detect, alert, and respond to anomalous privileged activity while attacks are in progress. Privileged Threat Analytics uses algorithms to profile and analyze individual privileged user behavior and creates prioritized alerts when abnormal activity is detected. Privileged Threat Analytics can automatically contain an attack by invalidating a stolen credential to block an attacker from further penetrating the network perimeter. Privileged Threat Analytics uses historical data collected by its Privileged Account Security Solution, Digital Vault and other network data sources to create and maintain a profile of each privileged user's behavior. It specializes in analyzing behavior related to privileged user behavior, thus providing vital intelligence on the critical attack vector.The Company's Application Identity Manager addresses the challenges of hard-coded, embedded credentials and cryptographic keys being hijacked and exploited by malicious insiders or external cyber attackers. Its Endpoint Privilege Manager is intended to secure and manage the use of privileged accounts and credentials on the endpoint, and can be deployed on premise or as a cloud-based solution. Endpoint Privilege Manager is designed to help organizations reduce the attack surface by removing local administrative privileges for business users, granularly controlling IT administrator privileges on Windows Servers based on role and elevating privileges when necessary and authorized. Endpoint Privilege Manager's application control features also enable organizations to control and monitor all applications within the environment, identify the original source and instances of malicious applications in the environment for incident response, or supporting forensic investigations. Endpoint Privilege Manager also provides a layer of credential protection and can detect and block attempts of malicious applications to hijack credentials and to alert the organization of such in-progress attack.The Company's On-Demand Privileges Manager allows customers to limit the breadth of access of Unix/Linux administrative accounts and granularly restrict them from performing certain commands and functions. Its shared technology platform includes its Digital Vault, Web Management Interface, Master Policy Engine and Discovery Engine. Digital Vault is an encrypted server that only responds to preset vault protocols to ensure security throughout an organization's network. Its Web Management Interface provides a single, user-friendly interface for customers to set, manage and monitor privileged account security policies across an entire organization. Its Master Policy Engine and Discovery Engine enable organizations to understand the scope of privileged account risk.The Company's Sensitive Information Management Solution provides a secure platform through which its customers' employees can share sensitive files while enabling the customer to monitor who is sharing these files. This allows organizations to isolate, store, share and track sensitive files and documents, such as customer credit card information, human resource records, intellectual property documents and legal information in a secure, internal environment. It also allows organizations to exchange sensitive information securely with their business partners, customers, suppliers and subcontractors.The Company competes with CA, Inc., Quest Software Inc. International Business Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Dell Inc., FireEye, Inc., Splunk Inc., Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. and Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
