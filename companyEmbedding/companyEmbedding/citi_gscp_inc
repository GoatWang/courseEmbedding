What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Frequently Asked Questions


General Citigroup Information






How is Citigroup organized?


For a description of the business segments and the products and services they provide, see the section How Citi is Organized, or refer to our 10-K or 10-Q SEC Filings.






When and how was Citigroup formed?


On April 6, 1998, the plan to merge Citicorp and Travelers Group was announced. On October 8, 1998, Citicorp merged with and into a subsidiary of Travelers Group, and Travelers Group changed its name to Citigroup Inc. At the time of the merger, Citicorp stockholders received 2.5 Citigroup shares for every 1 share of Citicorp stock they previously owned. Travelers Group stockholders maintained their shares of Travelers Group stock under the Citigroup name.
For its first two months, the merged companies, as Citigroup, traded under the exchange symbol "CCI," the symbol of Citicorp from 1985. However, on December 4, 1998, Citigroup began trading under its current stock symbol "C."
For more information on the history of Citigroup, please go to the Citi's History section under the About Citi tab. For more on Travelers Group, please see the Travelers Information section (below).






Where can I find information on Citigroup's subsidiaries?


A summary level diagram of Citigroup's selected principal subsidiaries is provided here.
A list of Citigroup's principal subsidiaries is included as an exhibit in Citigroup's SEC 10-K filings, as available on the SEC Website. There you can search for the latest 10-K document and find the List of Principal Subsidiaries exhibit within.






Who can I contact regarding my Citibank product (credit card, mortgage, etc.)?

Who should I contact regarding The Student Loan Corporation (SLC)?

Citigroup Stock Information






What is the ticker symbol for Citigroup common stock and on which exchanges does it trade?

Citigroup stock also has the distinction of being the first international company to be traded on the Mexican Stock Exchange (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores - BMV), and is listed under the ticker symbol "C*." Citigroup preferred stocks Series AA, C, J, K, L and S are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYX).
Please click to view Citigroup's Interactive Stock Price Chart or our Historical Price Lookup.






Where can I find information on Citigroup's Preferred Stock?

When has Citigroup had stock splits?


Click to view Citigroup's Stock Split History. Please note that Citigroup's Stock Split History reflects the stock splits of Citigroup and its predecessor companies only, not the splits of companies either acquired by or merged into Citigroup.

How can I get an annual report for Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (CGMI)?

Events and Presentations






What should I do if I'm having trouble viewing your webcast?


The use of popup blocking software may impair your ability to view our webcasts. If you are having trouble viewing the webcast (i.e. after registration the window disappears and your browser returns to the Investor Relations page) and you are unable to turn off your popup blocking software, contact your network operations or IT group for assistance.






How can I find out more about an upcoming industry conference?


If you would like more information on an announced Citigroup-sponsored industry event that is not listed on the Citi Investor Presentations page, it is likely that the event is not being hosted by Investor Relations.  We suggest you refer to your Citi investment representative or Citi Velocity at citivelocityhelp@citi.com.








Citigroup Common Stockholders






How can I get assistance with my Citigroup common stock?


We recommend you first contact your financial advisor or stock broker. You may also refer to our Stockholder Services page for information and resources available to you.






How can I buy Citigroup stock? Can I buy stock directly from you?


Citigroup does not offer initial direct stock purchase. Please refer to your financial advisor or stock broker. Once you are a Citi stockholder, you can enroll in our Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRP) through the program administrator, Computershare. There is a direct stock purchase feature to that plan.






What is the Citi Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRP)?


The Citi Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DRP) allows current Citigroup investors to reinvest dividends or make optional cash payments in order to directly purchase additional Citigroup common stock. The optional cash payments must be at least $50 and can be up to an aggregate of $120,000 per calendar year.






How can I participate in the DRP?


Registered stockholders and brokers on behalf of their clients are permitted to participate. The Plan Administrator is Computershare Trust Company, N.A. On their website, www.computershare.com/investor, you can find a summary of the Citigroup DRP, and download the plan prospectus. You can also download and submit an Enrollment Form, change your participation option or update your election online. You will need to register your account first if you have not previously. Once registered, select "Enroll in an Investment Plan."
Or, to request a copy of the prospectus or the Enrollment Form be sent to you, you may contact Computershare by email at: shareholder@computershare.com or by telephone at: (888) 250-3985 or (781) 575-4555 (for outside of North America).
If your shares of common stock are registered in a name other than your own (e.g., in the name of a broker or bank nominee) then you should: (1) have your shares re-registered in your own name(s) and then complete the Enrollment Form, or (2) make arrangements with your bank, broker or other nominee to participate on your behalf.
Where can I find information on Citigroup's common stock dividends?
Click to view Citigroup's Dividend History.






How can I get a Proxy Statement?


Previous proxy statements can be downloaded from the Annual Reports & Proxy Statements section of this website. To request a printed copy of proxy reports, please contact Document Services.






I have an old stock certificate, and I think Citi now manages that stock. What should I do?


Please  refer to our Stockholder Services page for information and resources available to you.

The customer service is right on point. They are always able to answer any questions that I may have unlike other companies out there. I have never had a problem with them. If I am late with a payment they work with me and give me a call to see what is going on and see if they can help. When I first applied for my card they walked me through all of the necessary steps to get it activated and told me about what the company could do for me. I even received a sign on bonus for opening a account with them. I was able to get 0% APR until the next year and they also had low transfer rates. Now that I have been with the company for a long time there is no way I would switch. I have also talked to some of my family and friends joining Citi and switching from the credit cards that they had. They are glad that they did and it is the only ones that they use now. They have also used Citi for loans and also personal banking.  Thank you, Citi!

Hi Marty,

It is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank. The reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the Citi Simplicity is because the AT&T Access More Credit Card is issued by Citibank as well. But 20% APR is very high, so I would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest. Two cards to consider that aren't issued by Citibank would be the Chase Slate, which offers 15 months with 0% APR and no balance transfer fee, or the Discover It, which has 18 months with 0% APR.

The best card I have is Capital Visa, even though I had very  bad credit .First they gave me $300.00 limits so I build it up to $500.00. Then they sent me a Visa Credit application, I sent it for the heck of it I received the card from them I was shock.They gave me $10,000.00 limits on this visa card plus if I spent $2,000.00 in my first 2 month i will get 20,000 mile which i already got. I really feel that Capital One Is the best card. I use it for everything now just to get my mile to travel.

If you have less than perfect credit, but can pay your credit card bill on time every time, get yourself a credit card from Capital One. I have a friend with excellent credit and has been a Citi card holder since 1989. Never missed a payment. His Interest rate is 19.99%. Do yourself favor contact Capital One.

Your friend should ask to speak to an acct mgr; I've been with Citi for 22 years and have a very high credit score- my record with them is perfect and without pulling a report  they reduced my interest rate at the time to very low interest; the 19.99 makes no sense unless something negative has happened.

I have been with Citi '99 and have always had excellent customer service with them.  I have called them quite a few times with various requests and have always gotten quickly through to a person.  I have even received 2 calls over the years from them asking about questionable purchases.  Both were fraudulent purchases.  They denied the charges, I never saw a charge on my statement, and they issued new cards.  Awesome company to deal with.

	Citibank Credit Card Review

	Citibank credit cards are issued through Citi Bank, a subsidiary of CitiGroup, which is a multinational umbrella organization encompassing dozens of major corporations within the global financial services industry. Citi operates in more than 100 different countries and boasts approximately 200 million customers.

	Citi Bank was originally founded in 1812 as a New York banking company. In the late 1990s Citi merged with Travelers Group to form the current CitiGroup brand. In addition to its credit card business CitiGroup also operates stock brokerage firms, insurance companies, investment banking services, wealth management services, and other ventures that offer financial services and related products.

	Citibank credit cards include student credit cards, travel rewards cards, and Citi credit cards that have “thank you” points programs that earn valuable rewards as you shop and make purchases. The Citi Platinum Select lineup of credit cards, for example, provide zero introductory APR offers and the Citi PremierPass card is a generous rewards credit card offering bonus points for selected purchases.
