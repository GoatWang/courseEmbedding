History[edit]
Dean Foods was founded by Samuel E. Dean, Sr., who owned an evaporated milk processing facility in Franklin Park, Illinois, in the 1920s.[6] After purchasing other Illinois dairy plants Dean developed the enterprise "from a small regional dairy into a diversified food company".[3]

In December 2001, the legacy brand of Dean Foods was acquired by the Dallas-based Suiza Foods Corporation, who later adopted the Dean Foods name.[7] In 2005, Dean Specialty Foods was spun off from Dean Foods as Bay Valley Foods, LLC, a division of TreeHouse Foods, Inc.[8] In June 2005 TreeHouse Foods started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of THS.[8]
In March 2005 the Cornucopia Institute filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) alleging that their Horizon Organic subsidiary was violating "organic livestock management" standards.[9][10]
In August 2006, Dean Foods acquired Jilbert's Dairy, a 70-year-old family business near Marquette, Michigan.[11] Dean Food's TofuTown brand was acquired by the Hain Celestial Group in June 2007. In December, Dean Foods bought the Wells Dairy milk plant in Le Mars, Iowa.[12] Dean Foods purchased Alpro in 2009 for an estimated US$455 million, making it a "global leader in soy beverages".[5] This resulted in a restructuring of the company that included selling off a number of subsidiaries, including Rachel's Organic.[13]
On May 12, 2008, the Cornucopia Institute filed a second complaint with the USDA again alleging that Deans Foods had violated federal organic regulations requiring access to pasture and fresh grass for their dairy cows.[14]
Silk brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans until early 2009, when Dean Foods switched to conventional soybeans while maintaining the same UPC barcodes and prices on the Silk products and replacing the word “organic” with “natural” on the product's packaging,[15] prompting the Cornucopia Institute to file complaints that the company had not properly notified retailers or consumers.[16][17]
Foremost Farms USA, a cooperative of over 2,000 dairy farmers in several mid-western states, sold its Wisconsin milk processing plants to Dean Foods in 2009.[18] In January 2010, the US Department of Justice and the state attorney generals office of Wisconsin and Michigan, filed a lawsuit objecting to the purchase and alleged that it created a monopolizing provider.[19] Dean Foods announced it was contesting the complaint.[20]
In the first quarter of 2010 the company moved to the Cityplace district of Dallas, Texas.[21][22] In October 2010, Dean Foods announced it was retiring the Schepps brand for dairy products in the Dallas, Texas area in favor of their Oak Farms brand. The Schepps brand had been in the Dallas market since 1942.[22][23]
In 2011, a class action suit was brought against Deans Foods over health claims made on the packaging of Horizon Organic Milk.[24] In 2012, Dean Foods contributed $253,950 to fund opposition to California's ballot Proposition 37 which would require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.[25][26]
In May 2015 Dean Foods announced that they would eliminate regional brands for its milk in favor of a single brand, DairyPure, which was already being used as a sub-brand under its previous regional marketing scheme.[27]
In 2017, bettor and stock trader William T. Walters was convicted of insider trading in Dean shares in Federal court. Walters' source of non-public information was company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone nicknamed "the Batphone" and, sometimes, the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for the company name. The case involved profits or avoided losses of $40 million from 2008 to 2014. The verdict was to be appealed according to Walters' lawyer.[28]

History[edit]
Dean Foods was founded by Samuel E. Dean, Sr., who owned an evaporated milk processing facility in Franklin Park, Illinois, in the 1920s.[6] After purchasing other Illinois dairy plants Dean developed the enterprise "from a small regional dairy into a diversified food company".[3]




Dean Foods headquarters in the Tower at Cityplace in Dallas


In December 2001, the legacy brand of Dean Foods was acquired by the Dallas-based Suiza Foods Corporation, who later adopted the Dean Foods name.[7] In 2005, Dean Specialty Foods was spun off from Dean Foods as Bay Valley Foods, LLC, a division of TreeHouse Foods, Inc.[8] In June 2005 TreeHouse Foods started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of THS.[8]
In March 2005 the Cornucopia Institute filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) alleging that their Horizon Organic subsidiary was violating "organic livestock management" standards.[9][10]
In August 2006, Dean Foods acquired Jilbert's Dairy, a 70-year-old family business near Marquette, Michigan.[11] Dean Food's TofuTown brand was acquired by the Hain Celestial Group in June 2007. In December, Dean Foods bought the Wells Dairy milk plant in Le Mars, Iowa.[12] Dean Foods purchased Alpro in 2009 for an estimated US$455 million, making it a "global leader in soy beverages".[5] This resulted in a restructuring of the company that included selling off a number of subsidiaries, including Rachel's Organic.[13]
On May 12, 2008, the Cornucopia Institute filed a second complaint with the USDA again alleging that Deans Foods had violated federal organic regulations requiring access to pasture and fresh grass for their dairy cows.[14]
Silk brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans until early 2009, when Dean Foods switched to conventional soybeans while maintaining the same UPC barcodes and prices on the Silk products and replacing the word “organic” with “natural” on the product's packaging,[15] prompting the Cornucopia Institute to file complaints that the company had not properly notified retailers or consumers.[16][17]
Foremost Farms USA, a cooperative of over 2,000 dairy farmers in several mid-western states, sold its Wisconsin milk processing plants to Dean Foods in 2009.[18] In January 2010, the US Department of Justice and the state attorney generals office of Wisconsin and Michigan, filed a lawsuit objecting to the purchase and alleged that it created a monopolizing provider.[19] Dean Foods announced it was contesting the complaint.[20]
In the first quarter of 2010 the company moved to the Cityplace district of Dallas, Texas.[21][22] In October 2010, Dean Foods announced it was retiring the Schepps brand for dairy products in the Dallas, Texas area in favor of their Oak Farms brand. The Schepps brand had been in the Dallas market since 1942.[22][23]
In 2011, a class action suit was brought against Deans Foods over health claims made on the packaging of Horizon Organic Milk.[24] In 2012, Dean Foods contributed $253,950 to fund opposition to California's ballot Proposition 37 which would require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.[25][26]
In May 2015 Dean Foods announced that they would eliminate regional brands for its milk in favor of a single brand, DairyPure, which was already being used as a sub-brand under its previous regional marketing scheme.[27]
In 2017, bettor and stock trader William T. Walters was convicted of insider trading in Dean shares in Federal court. Walters' source of non-public information was company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone nicknamed "the Batphone" and, sometimes, the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for the company name. The case involved profits or avoided losses of $40 million from 2008 to 2014. The verdict was to be appealed according to Walters' lawyer.[28]

History[edit]
Dean Foods was founded by Samuel E. Dean, Sr., who owned an evaporated milk processing facility in Franklin Park, Illinois, in the 1920s.[6] After purchasing other Illinois dairy plants Dean developed the enterprise "from a small regional dairy into a diversified food company".[3]

In December 2001, the legacy brand of Dean Foods was acquired by the Dallas-based Suiza Foods Corporation, who later adopted the Dean Foods name.[7] In 2005, Dean Specialty Foods was spun off from Dean Foods as Bay Valley Foods, LLC, a division of TreeHouse Foods, Inc.[8] In June 2005 TreeHouse Foods started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of THS.[8]
In March 2005 the Cornucopia Institute filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) alleging that their Horizon Organic subsidiary was violating "organic livestock management" standards.[9][10]
In August 2006, Dean Foods acquired Jilbert's Dairy, a 70-year-old family business near Marquette, Michigan.[11] Dean Food's TofuTown brand was acquired by the Hain Celestial Group in June 2007. In December, Dean Foods bought the Wells Dairy milk plant in Le Mars, Iowa.[12] Dean Foods purchased Alpro in 2009 for an estimated US$455 million, making it a "global leader in soy beverages".[5] This resulted in a restructuring of the company that included selling off a number of subsidiaries, including Rachel's Organic.[13]
On May 12, 2008, the Cornucopia Institute filed a second complaint with the USDA again alleging that Deans Foods had violated federal organic regulations requiring access to pasture and fresh grass for their dairy cows.[14]
Silk brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans until early 2009, when Dean Foods switched to conventional soybeans while maintaining the same UPC barcodes and prices on the Silk products and replacing the word “organic” with “natural” on the product's packaging,[15] prompting the Cornucopia Institute to file complaints that the company had not properly notified retailers or consumers.[16][17]
Foremost Farms USA, a cooperative of over 2,000 dairy farmers in several mid-western states, sold its Wisconsin milk processing plants to Dean Foods in 2009.[18] In January 2010, the US Department of Justice and the state attorney generals office of Wisconsin and Michigan, filed a lawsuit objecting to the purchase and alleged that it created a monopolizing provider.[19] Dean Foods announced it was contesting the complaint.[20]
In the first quarter of 2010 the company moved to the Cityplace district of Dallas, Texas.[21][22] In October 2010, Dean Foods announced it was retiring the Schepps brand for dairy products in the Dallas, Texas area in favor of their Oak Farms brand. The Schepps brand had been in the Dallas market since 1942.[22][23]
In 2011, a class action suit was brought against Deans Foods over health claims made on the packaging of Horizon Organic Milk.[24] In 2012, Dean Foods contributed $253,950 to fund opposition to California's ballot Proposition 37 which would require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.[25][26]
In May 2015 Dean Foods announced that they would eliminate regional brands for its milk in favor of a single brand, DairyPure, which was already being used as a sub-brand under its previous regional marketing scheme.[27]
In 2017, bettor and stock trader William T. Walters was convicted of insider trading in Dean shares in Federal court. Walters' source of non-public information was company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone nicknamed "the Batphone" and, sometimes, the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for the company name. The case involved profits or avoided losses of $40 million from 2008 to 2014. The verdict was to be appealed according to Walters' lawyer.[28]

Got Milk? Too much of it, say U.S. dairy farmers
U.S. dairy farmers' big bet on global demand for milk is souring. The industry was in trouble long before a trade squabble with Canada last month that reduced demand for ultrafiltered milk, a cheese ingredient. Dairy farmers fear a spat that has jeopardized roughly $150 million in sales for Wisconsin, New York and Minnesota producers is just a prelude to disruptions to come if President Donald Trump renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement as promised.

Dean Foods shares fall after earnings miss
Dean Foods Co.  shares fell 3.1% in Tuesday premarket trading after the company reported first-quarter earnings that missed estimates. Net loss was $9.8 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with income of $39.2 million, or 43 cents per share, year-over-year. Adjusted EPS was 13 cents, falling short of the 17-cent FactSet consensus. Revenue was $2.00 billion, up from $1.89 billion last year, and ahead of the $1.97 billion FactSet consensus. The company reaffirmed its full-year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.35 to $1.55. The FactSet estimate is $1.40. Dean Foods believes its recent DairyPure sour cream launch, and an investment in and distribution deal with Good Karma, a producer of flax-based milk and yogurt products, are growth opportunities. Dean Foods shares are down 12.3% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 7.2% for the period.

From Our CEO
At Dean Foods, we take pride in our role as a responsible corporate citizen – environmentally, socially, and philanthropically. We know that doing the right thing is the best thing for our business, and meeting this expectation has become a requirement to stay competitive. From reducing our carbon footprint to improving the safety of our employees, we are committed to keeping corporate responsibility an integral part of our work.
We align our responsibility initiatives with our business objectives. Although our company has changed dramatically in recent years, we have continued to focus on operating in a way that is right for us, right for consumers, right for our customers and right for the environment. To do this, we have become more efficient in the way we operate, embraced partnerships with industry experts and organizations, and expanded our culture of continuous improvement. These actions lead to more responsible and more efficient choices, which can lower our costs and improve our business.
We also continue to support programs that improve our local communities. Through the Dean Foods Foundation, we focus our giving on four key areas where we can have the greatest impact, and which align with our identity as a producer of healthy foods and beverages: ending childhood hunger, promoting nutrition education, supporting responsible agriculture, and providing disaster relief in times of need. In addition, our employees volunteer thousands of hours to charitable causes nationwide. Our management team works closely with civic and business leaders to advance policy and other initiatives that help local economies thrive and prosper.
Dean Foods is the largest processor of milk and dairy products in the U.S., and continuing our success means making the right long-term choices for all of our stakeholders. We are proud of our accomplishments, but we know we have more work to do. I encourage you to explore this website and learn more about our efforts to become a more responsible company.
Ralph Scozzafava  CEO, Dean Foods Company
 
Past Reports View our past 2010 or 2008 Corporate Responsibility reports. 
The 2008 and 2010 reports include the contributions of The WhiteWave Foods Company Company (NYSE: WWAV) to Dean Foods sustainability metrics because Dean Foods controlled WhiteWave during such time and reflected WhiteWave as the WhiteWave-Alpro segment in its financial statements. WhiteWave became a separate publicly traded company in October 2012 and Dean Foods completed a spin-off and subsequent divestiture of its remaining ownership interests in WhiteWave during 2013. Similarly, these reports include the contributions of its prior business segment, Morningstar Foods. Dean Foods sold Morningstar Foods in early 2013.
With the completed spin-off of our WhiteWave business and the sale of our Morningstar business in 2013, all sustainability metrics throughout this site, going back to 2007, have been recalculated to reflect the current structure of Dean Foods.

History[edit]
Dean Foods was founded by Samuel E. Dean, Sr., who owned an evaporated milk processing facility in Franklin Park, Illinois, in the 1920s.[6] After purchasing other Illinois dairy plants Dean developed the enterprise "from a small regional dairy into a diversified food company".[3]




Dean Foods headquarters in the Tower at Cityplace in Dallas


In December 2001, the legacy brand of Dean Foods was acquired by the Dallas-based Suiza Foods Corporation, who later adopted the Dean Foods name.[7] In 2005, Dean Specialty Foods was spun off from Dean Foods as Bay Valley Foods, LLC, a division of TreeHouse Foods, Inc.[8] In June 2005 TreeHouse Foods started trading on the New York Stock Exchange with a ticker of THS.[8]
In March 2005 the Cornucopia Institute filed a complaint with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) alleging that their Horizon Organic subsidiary was violating "organic livestock management" standards.[9][10]
In August 2006, Dean Foods acquired Jilbert's Dairy, a 70-year-old family business near Marquette, Michigan.[11] Dean Food's TofuTown brand was acquired by the Hain Celestial Group in June 2007. In December, Dean Foods bought the Wells Dairy milk plant in Le Mars, Iowa.[12] Dean Foods purchased Alpro in 2009 for an estimated US$455 million, making it a "global leader in soy beverages".[5] This resulted in a restructuring of the company that included selling off a number of subsidiaries, including Rachel's Organic.[13]
On May 12, 2008, the Cornucopia Institute filed a second complaint with the USDA again alleging that Deans Foods had violated federal organic regulations requiring access to pasture and fresh grass for their dairy cows.[14]
Silk brand soy milk was made using organic soybeans until early 2009, when Dean Foods switched to conventional soybeans while maintaining the same UPC barcodes and prices on the Silk products and replacing the word “organic” with “natural” on the product's packaging,[15] prompting the Cornucopia Institute to file complaints that the company had not properly notified retailers or consumers.[16][17]
Foremost Farms USA, a cooperative of over 2,000 dairy farmers in several mid-western states, sold its Wisconsin milk processing plants to Dean Foods in 2009.[18] In January 2010, the US Department of Justice and the state attorney generals office of Wisconsin and Michigan, filed a lawsuit objecting to the purchase and alleged that it created a monopolizing provider.[19] Dean Foods announced it was contesting the complaint.[20]
In the first quarter of 2010 the company moved to the Cityplace district of Dallas, Texas.[21][22] In October 2010, Dean Foods announced it was retiring the Schepps brand for dairy products in the Dallas, Texas area in favor of their Oak Farms brand. The Schepps brand had been in the Dallas market since 1942.[22][23]
In 2011, a class action suit was brought against Deans Foods over health claims made on the packaging of Horizon Organic Milk.[24] In 2012, Dean Foods contributed $253,950 to fund opposition to California's ballot Proposition 37 which would require mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.[25][26]
In May 2015 Dean Foods announced that they would eliminate regional brands for its milk in favor of a single brand, DairyPure, which was already being used as a sub-brand under its previous regional marketing scheme.[27]
In 2017, bettor and stock trader William T. Walters was convicted of insider trading in Dean shares in Federal court. Walters' source of non-public information was company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone nicknamed "the Batphone" and, sometimes, the code words "Dallas Cowboys" for the company name. The case involved profits or avoided losses of $40 million from 2008 to 2014. The verdict was to be appealed according to Walters' lawyer.[28]

Dean Foods Co. Restructuring Its Branding Strategy For Its Dairy ProductsMay 05, 2015 |  About: 
DF  +0%



The largest milk processor in the U.S. is now taking steps to unify all its white milk brands around the country into a single brand. In an announcement significant to Dean Foods Co.'s(NYSE:DF) future growth strategy, the company recently made this declaration that it will integrate all its 31 regional milk brands into a single brand, "DairyPure." Dairy Foods will however retain regional labels like Berkeley Farms, Dean's and Garelick Farms etc. but they would be placed alongside ‘DairyPure’ name on the packaging.
Dean Foods Company is primarily into food and beverages, competing with the likes of Dairy Farmers of America and California Diaries. The company’s product range comprise of white milk, ice cream, cultured dairy products, creamers, juice, tea, ice cream mix, and other dairy products that are distributed through retailers, distributors, foodservice outlets, educational institutions and governmental entities across the country. Hitherto Dean Foods was selling several brands having limited regional presence and was battling competition, struggling to protect its falling market share on one hand and rising cost of goods sold on the other. The company has a 35-36 percent U.S. market share.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with DF. Click here to check it out. 
DF 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of DFPeter Lynch Chart of DFBenefit of single brand
While in a competitive scenario, companies choose to grow and protect their markets by launching several brands of a single product and attack at various price segments and geographies, at times having a single brand and focusing on its growth, too, is not a bad idea. Having a unified brand will help the company market the brand better and all its energies will be focused in selling "DairyPure." Besides it can claim to market fresh milk in different markets, processed from its nearest regional diaries. Consolidation will mean more sales, higher production capacity utilization and higher profit margins as a result of decreased promotion & selling costs. This will help the company come out of the red and maybe earn sustainable profits.
For many years Dean Foods’ major challenges have been declining per-capita U.S. milk consumption, fierce competition from other beverages, demographic shifts and other factors. This has resulted in the closure of 13 factories, or 15 percent of its production capacity. The company’s remaining 70 plants too are operational at just over three-fifths or about 60% of their capacities.
Will it spell profits?
Dean Foods slipped into losses for the year ended December 2014. As against a net income of $813.2 million in 2013, the company posted a loss of $20.30 million despite the growth in revenues from $9.0 billion in 2013 to $9.5 billion in 2014. The announcement has so far failed to cheer investors. The stock has seen little upside during the past couple of trading session.
There is skepticism. Though the adoption of one brand will make "DairyPure" a $2.50 billion brand catapulting it to one of the largest consumer packaged goods in the U.S., it also needs to be mentioned that the journey is going to be anything but smooth, given the contemporary consumer behavior and falling average milk consumption in the U.S. The company may have to answer several health and weight control issues. It may need to convince consumers about the suitability of cow’s milk as a good source of protein and Vitamin D, its product being antibiotic free and natural. Besides all these even competition may choose to play spoil sport by adopting counter strategies.
It therefore remains to be seen whether Dean Foods can be profitable soon again and whether the same is attributable to "DairyPure."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Dean Buys Milk Products

Prepared Foods September 20, 2004 enewsletter
Dean Foods Co. bested a rival to buy the Milk Products of Alabama LLC unit of Parmalat USA Corp. for $21.6 million in cash.

Judge Robert Drain of U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan approved the sale after Dean trumped a $19.7 million stalking-horse offer from National Dairy Holdings LP, said Gary Holtzer, New York debtor counsel at Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP.

Wallington, N.J.-based Parmalat USA, a unit of Italy's Parmalat Finanziaria SPA, had extended the bid deadline and then opened the two formal bids, selecting Dean's offer, Holtzer said. 

"The auction was first adjourned (Monday); and then it was canceled (Tuesday), and then we presented the Dean offer to the court (Wednesday)," he said.

The sale is due to close by the end of the month.

"There were no objections to the sale, and the creditors committee is very pleased with the outcome," said David LeMay, New York creditors counsel at Chadbourne & Parke LLP.

Dean, the Dallas company once known as Suiza Foods, has rolled up a series of acquisitions since its 1996 IPO to make it the largest dairy producer in the United States. In 2002, it paid $189 million for White Wave, which makes the Silk brand of soy milk and earlier this year, it snapped up organic milk maker Horizon Organic for $287 million.

The buyer's EBITDA has grown an average of 24% per year between 1999 and 2003 to outpace agri-product giants Archer Daniels Midland Co., General Mills Co. and Kraft Foods Inc., records show.

Parmalat USA plans to reorganize around its Farmland Dairies LLC division and its assets in New York and New Jersey. It will detail these plans in a disclosure statement and reorganization plan due by month's end, Holtzer said.

He noted that when the committee and lenders Citigroup Inc. and GE Capital Corp. reach a settlement on recoveries, the disclosure statement and plan would be filed.

Because it loses the auction, Dallas-based National Dairy will be entitled to a $600,000 break-up fee and up to $300,000 in expenses.

Parmalat USA had planned to shop its assets at its February 24 Chapter 11 filing, but the milk maker failed to attract bids high enough to satisfy GE Capital. Despite several extensions on bid deadlines under $35 million debtor-in-possession financing from the General Electric unit, bids still fell short.
