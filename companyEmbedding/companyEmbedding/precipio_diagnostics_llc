Precipio Diagnostics And Transgenomic Complete Merger






Business Wire




Jun 30, 2017 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Precipio Diagnostics, LLC and Transgenomic Inc. (OTCQB: TBIOD) today announced the closing of their previously announced merger. In connection with the transaction, Transgenomic has changed its name to Precipio, Inc. Precipio's common stock is expected to commence trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the new ticker symbol "PRPO" upon the opening of trading on June 30, 2017, or soon thereafter.  The company will operate under the leadership of Ilan Danieli, Chief Executive Officer; Carl Iberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Miller, Chief Commercial Officer. The Board of Directors of Precipio will initially be comprised of five directors: Robert Patzig will remain as Chairman of the Board, together with Michael Luther, one of Transgenomic's existing board members. Samuel Riccitelli, Mark Rimer and Ilan Danieli together comprise the remaining members of the board. Precipio's corporate headquarters is in New Haven, Connecticut.  "The union of Precipio and Transgenomic enables us to fulfill our vision of a world-class, innovative company dedicated to eradicating the pervasive problem of disease misdiagnosis," said Ilan Danieli, CEO of Precipio. "We believe that the combination of Precipio and Transgenomic can transform medical care by leveraging Precipio's unique diagnostic platform with Transgenomic's enabling technology for DNA liquid biopsies to deliver better and more accurate diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide."  Terms of the merger include the initial closing on a $1.2 million private placement of preferred and convertible securities, out of a total authorized amount of up to $7 million in preferred equity. Simultaneous with the merger, holders of more than $14 million in secured debt have converted into equity, providing the combined company with a stronger balance sheet.  "Completion of our merger marks an exciting new chapter in the history of our companies. Precipio and Transgenomic's teams have already accomplished a great deal in our shared drive to ensure that the new Precipio is primed for growth. We look forward to sharing more details on our plans and milestones in the coming weeks," Mr. Danieli concluded.

Democratizing Diagnostics


Connecting Physicians and their patients with the
highest level of diagnostic expertise to battle cancer.


Connecting physicians and their patients with the
highest level of diagnostic expertise to battle cancer.


Democratizing Diagnostics


















THE PROBLEM


Delivering a correct diagnosis requires increased skill, expertise, and specialization.
The economic forces within the world of diagnostics continue to drive the market towards generalization, and away from specialization. This results in the alarmingly growing, and largely ignored problem of misdiagnosis.



GENERALIZATION





SPECIALIZATION










Back to Top ^







The consequences of misdiagnosis







Patient suffering & death







Absent proper diagnostic support, physicians are handicapped in delivering the best care to their patients.







Significant downstream healthcare dollars wasted (estimated at $10-15B annually in the US).




In order to avoid these consequences, physicians need access to expertise from specialists,
rather than generalists.









We have the expertise


We’ve harnessed the best resources within leading academic institutions, and we deliver them
to support community clinicians.







We give physicians access to the expertise they require, to support the care for their patients.







We engage patients in the process and enable them to influence their healthcare decisions.







We translate the expertise, and technology developed at academic institutions to benefit those outside its walls.




With the combination of academic expertise, and the translation of this expertise to the community setting, Precipio has demonstrated a significantly superior level of diagnostic accuracy.






We'VE ACHIEVED GROUNDBREAKING DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY


In the past four years, we’ve diagnosed over 3,000 cases sent to us by community oncologists from around the world, and we've demonstrated an >99% level of diagnostic accuracy.



Industry*


Precipio**

* Based on several industry studies including the 2015 Report by the Institute of Health; and the 2012 Study by the National Coalition of Health Care.


** Based on an initial data set of over 100 clinical cases diagnosed at Precipio, with a 2nd opinion then conducted at an outside institution.

(TBIO) today announced that its stockholders have approved the merger with Precipio Diagnostics, LLC. Upon completion of the merger, the company expects to meet the requirements for its stock to be relisted on NASDAQ under the new symbol “PRPO.”Over 90% of the votes cast by Transgenomic shareholders were in favor of the merger and the other various proposals that were put forth for consideration at yesterday’s special stockholder meeting. In addition, Precipio Diagnostics’ members approved the merger with over 95% of the outstanding membership interests voting in favor. Both companies are continuing to work to close the combined company’s $7 million private placement of preferred convertible securities, as well as a conversion of all outstanding secured debt into the combined company’s preferred convertible securities.Upon completion of these remaining conditions, the merger will be consummated. Additionally, the conversion of secured debt and planned capital infusion are expected to provide the combined company with a clean balance sheet and sufficient capital to pursue its planned expansion.Paul Kinnon, Transgenomic President and Chief Executive Officer, said “We are very pleased that the merger with Precipio has been approved by the stakeholders in both companies. We believe that the combination of our leading ICE COLD-PCR mutation detection technology and Precipio Diagnostics’ unique business model and expertise aimed at improving the diagnosis and treatment of cancer has major clinical and commercial potential.”“We are delighted to have reached this stage and received the approval of both companies’ stockholders and members for the merger. We appreciate everyone’s patience as the companies went through this long and complex process, and now we are ready to get to work and focus together on building the new company,” said Ilan Danieli, Precipio Diagnostics founder and Chief Executive Officer. “We believe strongly that this is the beginning of increased value creation for our stockholders and new investors, as we join these two companies’ business models and teams, utilizing our network of expertise, and proprietary technologies to deliver an improved level of diagnostic accuracy to patients.”Transgenomic’s ICE COLD-PCR (ICP) offers major advantages over current sequencing technologies. It delivers at least a 100-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to standard methodologies, allowing detection of both known and previously unknown genetic alterations in any exon of any gene using a single assay. It is robust, easy to use and easily implemented, requiring minimal disruption to established sequencing workflows. ICP technology is available as ICEme™ Kits that deliver up to a 500-fold increase in mutation detection compared to most current methods, with levels of detection routinely achievable down to 0.01%. This ultra-high sensitivity enables detection of low level mutations that allow accurate patient monitoring as well as stratification of cancer sub-populations. ICEme Kits work well with most patient samples, including tissue, blood, plasma, urine and other biofluids. The kits are simple to use and work with most of the genomic analytic platforms available in laboratories today. They are easily customizable for use with single mutations or in combination. The current menu includes approximate 20 clinically relevant, actionable mutations that are associated with important cancers. Additional mutations are being added on an ongoing basis.ICE COLD-PCR was originally developed by the laboratory of Dr. Mike Makrigiorgos at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which has exclusively licensed rights to the technology to Transgenomic.About TransgenomicTransgenomic, Inc. is a global biotechnology company advancing personalized medicine in oncology and inherited diseases through advanced diagnostic technologies, such as its revolutionary ICE COLD-PCR, which enables use of liquid biopsies for mutation detection. The company also provides specialized clinical and research services to biopharmaceutical companies developing targeted therapies. Transgenomic’s diagnostic technologies are designed to improve medical diagnoses and patient outcomes.Read MoreAbout Precipio DiagnosticsPrecipio Diagnostics has built a platform to harness the intellect, expertise and technology developed within academia, delivering quality diagnostic information to physicians and patients worldwide.

Precipio Diagnostics and Transgenomic Complete Merger 
 

Previous 

Precipio Diagnostics and Transgenomic Complete Merger 
Company Renamed Precipio, Inc.–To Commence Trading On NASDAQ Under The New Ticker “PRPO”
NEW HAVEN, Conn. and OMAHA, Neb., (June 30, 2017) – Precipio Diagnostics, LLC and Transgenomic Inc. (OTCQB: TBIOD) today announced the closing of their previously announced merger. In connection with the transaction, Transgenomic has changed its name to Precipio, Inc. Precipio’s common stock is expected to commence trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market under the new ticker symbol “PRPO” upon the opening of trading on June 30, 2017, or soon thereafter. 
The company will operate under the leadership of Ilan Danieli, Chief Executive Officer; Carl Iberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Miller, Chief Commercial Officer. The Board of Directors of Precipio will initially be comprised of five directors:  Robert Patzig will remain as Chairman of the Board, together with Michael Luther, one of Transgenomic’s existing board members. Samuel Riccitelli, Mark Rimer and Ilan Danieli together comprise the remaining members of the board. Precipio’s corporate headquarters is in New Haven, Connecticut.
“The union of Precipio and Transgenomic enables us to fulfill our vision of a world-class, innovative company dedicated to eradicating the pervasive problem of disease misdiagnosis,” said Ilan Danieli, CEO of Precipio. “We believe that the combination of Precipio and Transgenomic can transform medical care by leveraging Precipio’s unique diagnostic platform with Transgenomic’s enabling technology for DNA liquid biopsies to deliver better and more accurate diagnostic information to physicians and their patients worldwide.”
Terms of the merger include the initial closing on a $1.2 million private placement of preferred and convertible securities, out of a total authorized amount of up to $7 million in preferred equity. Simultaneous with the merger, holders of more than $14 million in secured debt have converted into equity, providing the combined company with a stronger balance sheet.
“Completion of our merger marks an exciting new chapter in the history of our companies. Precipio and Transgenomic’s teams have already accomplished a great deal in our shared drive to ensure that the new Precipio is primed for growth. We look forward to sharing more details on our plans and milestones in the coming weeks,” Mr. Danieli concluded.
Over the course of the past few months, in anticipation of the contemplated merger, both companies have undertaken a rigorous cost-cutting project to reduce the combined companies’ historical burn rate. Post-merger, management anticipates the new organization will be a leaner, more capital-efficient organization. These efficiencies are expected to reduce the combined entity’s operating expenses by approximately $1 million or more per quarter, an anticipated annualized reduction of expenses of about $4-$5 million compared to 2016. The majority of the cost reductions will be achieved immediately post-closing and are related to reductions in administrative headcount and the consolidation of lab operations and facilities, with a focus on eliminating redundancies and realizing efficiencies.
Transgenomic’s Omaha CLIA-certified laboratory operations will move to Precipio’s New Haven location, thereby reducing the substantial costs associated with operating two fully-certified CLIA laboratories, including but not limited to reductions in staff, equipment and the total amount of leased space. In addition, Transgenomic recently completed a move from its existing 30,000 square foot facility in Omaha to a nearby smaller 5,000 square foot facility, reducing facility costs by more than 75%. The new location is well-suited to serve as the company’s R&D center. 
To accelerate commercial activities Precipio recently added a number of new salespeople to its sales team, and anticipates adding more by year end. The combined sales team has been cross-trained on both Precipio’s pathology services and Transgenomic’s ICE COLD-PCR (ICP) technology to enable immediate cross-selling opportunities. 
The company also intends to invest in further development of its ICP technology to define specific clinical applications, as well as simplifying the adaptability and implementation of ICP technology for its customers. 
Paul Kinnon, President and CEO of Transgenomic, said, “We believe that this merger with Precipio is an excellent strategic fit for Transgenomic that provides the opportunity to realize the clinical and commercial potential of our ICE COLD-PCR technology for DNA liquid biopsies, within the merged company’s broad focus on precision medicine. We are pleased to move forward as a combined entity to bring transformative solutions in medical diagnostics to physician and patients alike.”
