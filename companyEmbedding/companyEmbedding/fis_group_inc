Tireless and Creative in Our Pursuit of Exceptional Talent















 




Manager of Managers
Chemistry is Key
Rising above the noise requires a tireless and creative approach to conquer the complexities and identify the opportunities in market segments where the potential risks and rewards are often misunderstood. We’re driven to find great managers that can accomplish this task in the inherent inefficiencies of small cap, frontier, and emerging markets. In developed markets, where inefficiencies can be harder to identify,we seek managers with unique investment processes and concentrated, high active-share portfolios that allow them to capture alpha in unconventional ways.
We deploy these high conviction/high active share managers using a disciplined framework designed to achieve resilient, high-performing portfolios. Our focus on entrepreneurial managers is informed or supported by a considerable body of research suggesting that talented, high-active share managers are best positioned to outperform market benchmarks, net of fees. Further, as managers grow their asset base beyond certain thresholds, their active share tends to diminish. Additionally, smaller firms’ more nimble portfolio management teams and flat management structures typically enable faster and more efficient implementation of their best investment decisions. Therefore, we believe that focusing on smaller managers and specifically screening for high active share portfolios would best tap into this structural performance advantage. These entrepreneurial firms are often relatively unknown within the industry. Over the course of our history, we have developed the methods to find them through:

Development of a robust research universe through a combination of traditional and non-traditional sourcing techniques
Rigorous statistical analysis designed to evaluate the typically short track records of such managers
Evaluation of hundreds of entrepreneurial business and capital structures to better identify and address organizational risks
Development of proprietary portfolio construction techniques to harvest the contributions of individual managers while monitoring for the inherent variability of high active share managers
Acting as the initial third-party institutional funder for 25% of our managers

A Disciplined, Consistent Vetting Process
We seek to harvest the documented performance advantage of entrepreneurial managers while at the same time mitigating the risks associated with their individual styles. Our process includes several key components:

Global Equity
Unique Perspectives on Market Opportunity
Global markets present the broadest opportunity set and the greatest potential for active equity investors. The FIS Group investment approach of deploying teams of entrepreneurial managers within a strategic and macro-tactical framework is especially well suited to the inefficiencies of cross-border, multi-cap portfolios. We offer a global equity strategy that empowers our managers to isolate and capture opportunity wherever it can be found:

FIS Group Global Equity Strategy

Non U.S. Equity
Promising Demographics, Emerging Consumer Classes, Vibrant Markets
The FIS Group investment approach of deploying teams of entrepreneurial managers within a strategic and macro-tactical framework is especially well suited to the inefficiencies of cross-border, multi-cap portfolios. Our portfolio structure implicitly alleviates many of the idiosyncratic risks often attributed to investing in the non-U.S. equity markets. Our talented emerging and entrepreneurial managers typically have significant and intimate knowledge of the regions, countries, and positions as a result of having spent time working or traveling in the regions. Our buy-list contains numerous managers with regional expertise which allows us to customize client portfolios to meet specific benchmarks and risk constraints. Our non-U.S. strategies include:

FIS Group Non-U.S. Equity Strategy
FIS Group Non-U.S. Small Cap Strategy
FIS Group Emerging Markets Strategy
FIS Group Frontier Markets Strategy

U.S. Equity
Finding Hidden Gems in the World’s Most Efficient Market
No country or region attracts investment activity like Wall Street, an address synonymous with American capital markets. But for all of its vaunted information flow and continuous analyst coverage, it still presents pockets of opacity, irrational herding behaviors, and occasions of misinterpretation. We focus on American equity markets that present alpha opportunities for skilled and agile managers, including:

FIS Group U.S. All Cap Core Strategy
FIS Group U.S. Small Cap Core Strategy
FIS Group U.S. Small Cap Growth Strategy

Serving a Greater Good






 




Corporate Citizenship
FIS Group was formed to act as a catalyst for positive change. We seek to make a difference every day not only by connecting investors with innovative investment strategies and research but also by giving back. We organize and support impactful initiatives designed to foster financial literacy, democratize access to capital, and invest in the communities we serve.
A Good Measure
A Good Measure Foundation supports individuals and organizations that educate youth and work to improve the lives of impoverished or marginalized women and children. Founded by FIS Group in 2006, the foundation supports impactful initiatives, including a financial literacy program serving 40 to 120 middle school students at a local charter school in Philadelphia.
Financial Literacy
To participate effectively in our global economy, young people must learn to think critically and choose responsibly in their decisions as savers, investors, consumers, and members of the workforce.
In 2006, we launched the FIS Group Financial Literacy Program, an initiative designed to provide engaging and effective pathways to financial literacy and the development of skills essential to personal economic success. The program supports the Russell Byers Charter School in Philadelphia and seeks to improve financial literacy among students in low-income areas. The program incorporates rewards and incentives designed to reinforce the value of diligence, budgeting, saving, and investing. Over the course of the year, classroom lessons increase in complexity and are reinforced through active learning experiences, transaction simulations, and role-playing.
Funding for the program is provided by FIS Group’s 501(c)(3) affiliate, A Good Measure Foundation.

Why I work in investments
After moving to San Francisco from Manila at age 18, I would enter office buildings and scan the company directories. If a company sounded interesting, I would knock on the door and ask for a job. After six months of this, a very small emerging manager gave me a job. I knew nothing about investments and they couldn’t afford to hire anyone but they gave me a shot because I knocked and waited to be allowed to enter. They said my politeness got their attention. I was at the right place, at the right time and found people willing to provide an opportunity.
What makes FIS Group different
Having two proven alpha sources − top down allocation and bottom up manager selection − is truly unusual in this industry
Heroes and influences
My street-smart mother. She was always resourceful and persistent finding solutions for our daily needs. She was quick to recognize what she knew and what she didn’t know. She would surround herself with the brightest people.
Job satisfaction
The most rewarding thing is helping deserving new management companies to form, make connections, avoid failures, and capture opportunities
Definition of success
Helping make someone else’s life better

Why I work in investments
I started as a runner on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. I was working with my dad and discovered I had a love for markets
What makes FIS Group different
An emphasis on investment process, a strong curiosity about the world, a lack of ego conflicts and a family environment
How I make a difference
I help institutions to discover and weigh the benefits of a high-potential investment approach they might not otherwise have considered
What keeps me awake
The competition
If I weren’t in investments
I would be teaching on a deserted island
Creature comfort: Comfort foods
