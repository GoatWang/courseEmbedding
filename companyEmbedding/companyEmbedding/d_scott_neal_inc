About D. Scott Neal, Inc.
Created by Scott Neal in 1995, D. Scott Neal, Inc. is a respected, long-standing financial planning firm with offices in Lexington and Louisville, Ky. Scott and Vice-President Jerry Zimmerer lead this experienced team to focus on putting the clients’ best interests first. 
More than three decades of financial expertise are shared by D. Scott Neal’s partners. This team has been through the good times, up-and-down times and the challenging times of the financial roller coaster.  The  team’s passion is enhanced by sensitivity to the unique needs of each person.
Our Mission
In summing up the firm’s mission, Scott cited a recent article from Gallup: “Money may not buy happiness, but it is hard to be happy if you cannot meet your basic needs. Beyond that, the actual amount of money you have has less of an impact on your overall wellbeing than financial security and how you manage and spend your money. Financial wellbeing is about effectively managing your economic life.”
Added Scott, “The D. Scott Neal team is a strong proponent of wellbeing.  It’s what we are all about. We craft strategies for security which are intended to lead to greater wellbeing for our clients. Jerry and I have surrounded ourselves with a group of professionals who are singularly dedicated to client service.” 
This dedication to service crafted the firm’s unique way of working with clients. Jerry explained,“We help you first calculate the amount of resources that you have today and then partner with you to determine the realistic amount of the resources that you’ll likely have throughout your lifetime. Improving your standard of living now and throughout the remainder of your life is our focus and passion.”
Our Services
The firm’s offerings fit into two broad categories: broad-based financial planning and investment management services. 
Financial Planning
In developing a financial plan, the firm works with families at each stage of life, paying particular attention to the key transition periods, such as:

Planning and paying for education
Launching into a career
Making a job change
Planning for retirement
Paying for retirement
Leaving a legacy

Investment Management
A key differentiator with D. Scott Neal is the firm’s fee structure. “When I started our firm it was a conscious decision to be an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor rather than a representative of a broker dealer,” added Scott. This distinction delivers several benefits to clients:

Money is managed on a continuous basis rather than as a one-time sale.
As an independent firm, D. Scott Neal can select investments from the entire universe of products with only the client’s best interests in mind.
As a fee-only advisor, team members do not collect commissions or work with hidden fees of any kind. They only work for the client. Jerry sums things up, “We strive to help our clients simplify their lives and are passionate about helping individuals and families reach their goals. We do it with sensitivity to the uniqueness of each person.”

                  Economics-Based, Long-Range Planning 
                  A More Valid Approach to Retirement Planning

                

By Scott Neal, CPA, CFP


There are many approaches to financial planning.  Today, the most popular are typically divided into two: 1. conventional goal seeking and 2. the economics’ approach.  It is important for you to know the difference and to understand which one your financial advisor is using and why he or she may choose one over the other.  At D. Scott Neal, Inc., we view these two approaches as different tools in our planner’s tool bag.  Just as in carpentry and mechanics, one must use the right tool for a particular job in order to achieve optimal results.

Conventional financial planning focuses on how much you need to set aside for a specific future goal, i.e. buying an asset such as a car, a boat, putting a down payment on a house, or funding a child’s college education.  Each targeted objective has a specific, usually very short-lived time frame for getting it done.  Note the nature of the transaction.  You save money for some period of time to spend it rather quickly.  Of course, college funding requires expenditures over 4 or 5 years, but that is still a relatively short period of time compared to retirement, for example.  Unfortunately, many financial planners use the same approach to plan for retirement or to produce other long-range plans.  That is like using a wrench to drive a nail or a hammer to change a flat tire.   


The primary reason that we believe the traditional approach is such a poor tool choice for retirement is two fold:  1) the length of time that one expects to be retired and 2) the incredible number of variables that must be taken into consideration to make the projection relevant over that period of time.  Recall that the traditional approach asks you to set a date for retirement (some will even give you the opportunity to set a date for semi-retirement prior to full retirement).  Further, it asks you to estimate the amount that will be needed from savings each year. It then calculates the total sum that will be needed on that date that will enable you to live long and prosper.  Make a mistake in the calculation or estimation of any of these variables at age 65, and by the time you reach old age, the error will be huge.


We argue that this approach to financial planning for retirement (or any other long-lived objective) is better for the advisor than it is for you, the client.  The advisor whose fee is determined by assets under management has a clear and compelling interest for you to save even more than may be necessary.  For example, if you ignore any one resource available to you (i.e. social security or funds from downsizing your residence) before or during retirement, you will automatically over-save.  Overestimate the amount needed in retirement and you will over-save.  Over-saving is almost as bad as under-saving because it comes at the expense of some part of your living standard today.  Let’s be very clear! We don’t intend to underplay the importance of saving.  We know that setting aside money while working in order to provide resources for the years when you do not earn money is vital for most of us.  Underestimate the need at retirement, and you will under-save and run the risk of outliving your money.   The point is that you do not have to rely on guesstimations with the economics’ approach to financial planning.

Most of our clients have told us that their very real concerns about retirement are two fold: 1) outliving their money and 2) having to reduce their living standard as they age.  When pressed on the issue, they are also concerned about having to reduce their current living standard in order to fund what some financial advisor or online tool has told them is the right amount to save. For some this is a valid concern; for others it is not. 
 


The answer to most of these questions (and a host of others) can be found in the economics’ approach to financial planning.  It focuses on planning for a smooth living standard for a long enough period that will cover most any lifetime. The approach has been popularized by Laurence Kotlikoff, economics professor at Boston University, and described in his book, Spend ‘til the End, but is built on research by none other than the late Irving Fisher of Yale University.  The concept of consumption smoothing has been around for over a century, but only now have we had the computational power for it to be used efficiently. Our firm uses Kotlikoff’s program, Economic Security Planner (esplanner). 

It is vitally important to understand that one’s living standard is supported by how much he or she spends each year, not how much is in the bank at any given point in time.  A restatement of our clients’ concerns above implies that most of us would like to have minimal disruption to our living standard throughout the remainder of our lives, even if we have very long lives. In other words, we would like our living standard to be smooth, or perhaps enhanced because of the decisions that we make today. Of course, economists tell us that by operating in an inflationary economy such as ours, the cost of living will go up.  More dollars will be required in the future to maintain the same living standard enjoyed today.

Smoothing your living standard means spreading your spending power evenly over time, so that you never have to worry about running out of money, even as the amount is adjusted for the rising cost of living and even as earnings stop at some point.   
 


Consumption smoothing does take into account the law of diminishing returns. That is, economists believe that one can have too much of a good thing and that sooner or later another dollar of spending does not yield another dollar’s worth of fulfillment. However, it also means protecting your living standard—making sure that it stays relatively steady in good and bad times. In other words, we believe that you do not want to suffer disruptions to your living standard due to adverse changes in income, certain expenses, taxes, government benefits, and inflation.  Additionally, you would want to make sure that the added risk of choosing one investment over another is actually worth it in terms of its effect on your living standard.     
 


We acknowledge that financial planning is truly about making decisions.  We view our job as one which helps you make better decisions regarding a lot of different financial variables.  Thus, we define a better decision as one that provides you with more money to spend for the same effort expended.  The first task then is to determine an amount that represents your maximum spending power this year that will remain smooth for the remainder of your life when adjusted for inflation. 
 


Finally, the economics’ approach to financial planning affords you the opportunity to know what it costs to do the things that you really love to do.  These may include taking a wonderful but lower-paying job, retiring sooner rather than later, buying a vacation residence, moving to a different climate, contributing to charity, or any other passion that may be uniquely yours.  It is easy to quantify the immediate cost of a vacation home, but what if you could know the long-term effect of that decision on your living standard for the rest of your life.  Using the economics’ approach, we can make that determination. So how do we do this?

1.	 Identify and quantify current and future resources 
First of all, we consider the amount of your resources that would, sooner or later throughout your lifetime, be available to spend to support your living standard. 
 
Resources typically consist of: 


Earned income from now until retirement. 
Gifts or inheritances (but should be included only if they are certain to occur). 
Both income and principal (if you are willing to spend your capital as you age) of investment accounts.  
Social security. 
Cash value of life insurance policies. 
Cash flow generated from the sale of an asset such as a vacation residence or a business interest. 


Note: Because you will always need a place to live, we do not consider your primary residence or your personal belongings as assets (resources) that will be used to fund your living standard.  You could, however, instruct us that you would be willing to downsize at some future date or even turn to renting, if that made sense.  We can make modifications to our analyses based on your specific needs and goals.  

2.	 Identify and quantify special expenditures  
There are some things that you will want to be certain get funded even at the expense of your current and future living standard.  Typically, these fall into two categories: necessary and discretionary.  The necessary may be to pay off existing debts, to fund the cost of long-term care or the premium for long-term care insurance, to fund a certain bequest upon death, or to fund funeral expenses. Discretionary goals can be anything that you dream about.  We add the ongoing cost of your housing to these other expenditures, and these make up the “special expenditures” for things that you want to make sure get funded before arriving at the amount available to spend on your living standard. 

3.  Build a base case scenario  
Some will view this as the “most likely” scenario while others see it as the “worst case.”  To arrive at the base case, we assume that taxes will have to be paid at the rates that are currently in the law, adjusted for inflation where necessary.  To calculate the true maximum sustainable living standard, we assume that at a certain age (we default to age 100 unless you tell us otherwise) you will have all your resources (except for your personal residence) spent.  Using dynamic programming we are then able to plan backwards from that target age to your current age to determine the amount of spending that will smooth your consumption adjusted for inflation. Perhaps you can see the complexity of the math that must be involved in such intricate computations.  The number that arises from this analysis is the maximum amount of money that you will be able to spend this year that can be adjusted for inflation for each year for the rest of your life. 

4.	  Plan for improvement in living standard  
As financial planners, our aim is to help you improve both your financial and personal well-being by working toward finding a higher, smoother, and more rewarding living standard.  Once the base case is established and assumptions agreed to, we can then build alternative scenarios to demonstrate the effect of our ideas on your living standard.  Some of our ideas have been: 1) increase or decrease funding of a tax-deferred retirement account; 2) convert a traditional IRA to a ROTH; 3) move to a state with lower or no income taxes; 4) downsize residence; 5) pay off debt earlier (or later); 6) start social security earlier (or later); 7) pay back social security and restart at a later date; 8) retire later; and/or 9) annuitize a pension or take a lump sum.    

5.	  Provide decision support with scenario planning  
In addition to our planning ideas outlined just above, there are times when clients have particular and pressing questions about their financial lives: 

Can I afford __________? You fill in the blank. 
Is working until age 66 really worth it? 
What is my safe rate of spending in retirement? 
Am I saving enough to sustain my living standard? 
Should I accelerate payoff of my debt? 
Should I have my child borrow money to go to school? 
How much can I afford to give away to children, grandchildren or charity? 


Each question is also a version of:  Can you raise your living standard? Can it be preserved? Can it be sacrificed to some extent in order to reach other goals? 
 
By now, you can see that each of your financial decisions should be evaluated on the merits of its effect on your living standard, now and throughout the future.  Having built the base case, we can then, in very short order, quantify the effect of the decision under consideration. We can isolate the relevant facts and circumstances of that decision into an alternative scenario and recommend whether a certain course of action will increase or decrease your living standard, and by how much.  Imagine how you will feel having made a more fully informed decision.

About D. Scott Neal, Inc.
Created by Scott Neal in 1995, D. Scott Neal, Inc. is a respected, long-standing financial planning firm with offices in Lexington and Louisville, Ky. Scott and Vice-President Jerry Zimmerer lead this experienced team to focus on putting the clients’ best interests first. 
More than three decades of financial expertise are shared by D. Scott Neal’s partners. This team has been through the good times, up-and-down times and the challenging times of the financial roller coaster.  The  team’s passion is enhanced by sensitivity to the unique needs of each person.
Our Mission
In summing up the firm’s mission, Scott cited a recent article from Gallup: “Money may not buy happiness, but it is hard to be happy if you cannot meet your basic needs. Beyond that, the actual amount of money you have has less of an impact on your overall wellbeing than financial security and how you manage and spend your money. Financial wellbeing is about effectively managing your economic life.”
Added Scott, “The D. Scott Neal team is a strong proponent of wellbeing.  It’s what we are all about. We craft strategies for security which are intended to lead to greater wellbeing for our clients. Jerry and I have surrounded ourselves with a group of professionals who are singularly dedicated to client service.” 
This dedication to service crafted the firm’s unique way of working with clients. Jerry explained,“We help you first calculate the amount of resources that you have today and then partner with you to determine the realistic amount of the resources that you’ll likely have throughout your lifetime. Improving your standard of living now and throughout the remainder of your life is our focus and passion.”
Our Services
The firm’s offerings fit into two broad categories: broad-based financial planning and investment management services. 
Financial Planning
In developing a financial plan, the firm works with families at each stage of life, paying particular attention to the key transition periods, such as:

Planning and paying for education
Launching into a career
Making a job change
Planning for retirement
Paying for retirement
Leaving a legacy

Investment Management
A key differentiator with D. Scott Neal is the firm’s fee structure. “When I started our firm it was a conscious decision to be an independent, fee-only registered investment advisor rather than a representative of a broker dealer,” added Scott. This distinction delivers several benefits to clients:

Money is managed on a continuous basis rather than as a one-time sale.
As an independent firm, D. Scott Neal can select investments from the entire universe of products with only the client’s best interests in mind.
As a fee-only advisor, team members do not collect commissions or work with hidden fees of any kind. They only work for the client. Jerry sums things up, “We strive to help our clients simplify their lives and are passionate about helping individuals and families reach their goals. We do it with sensitivity to the uniqueness of each person.”

How to Set  “SMARTER” Goals
Achieve More NOW

As financial planners we spend a lot of time helping our clients set goals and reduce them to writing. In fact, that is one of the standards of professional conduct imposed by the Certified Financial Planners Board of Standards.  Nearly every client comes to us with a long range goal in mind i.e. retire with enough to live on into old age, pay for college, get out of debt, etc. We have to pause to ask if the goals well-defined?  Usually they aren’t.
In order to become better equipped to help our clients set goals, I attended Michael Hyatt’s Best Year Ever Live Event earlier this year and have subsequently participated in his Activation Workshops to build on that experience.  I just returned from the second of those workshops designed to assess progress made in the quarter just ended and to refine the goals for next quarter.  In the program, Michael presented a method of “How to Set Goals” and has graciously granted me permission to share the method with you here. You can learn more about Michael and his work at michaelhyatt.com
Step #1: Select a life domain.  Ask yourself, where do I want to make progress?  These could be in the realm of Being (spiritual, intellectual, emotional, physical); Relating (marital, parental, social); or Doing (vocational, avocational, financial).
Step #2: State an aspiration.  An aspiration is simply an expression of a desire. Usually it starts with the words, “I want . . .”  Unfortunately, we see many clients starting and stopping at this point and the goal remains simply a wish. Aspirations are important in that our best goals tap into our deepest desires, but stopping here cuts the legs out from under our goals. As financial planners, we listen for critiques that each client places on his or her own financial management for clues related to finding the aspirations.
Step #3: Decide if it is an Achievement or a Habit Goal.  Achievement goals have a well-defined target that will be easily measured when you get there. Retire at age x.  Accumulate $x by age y. We usually default to achievement goals but we really need to ask whether a habit goal will best serve the outcome we desire. A habit goal is used when the aspiration is rather vague and / or hard to measure.  A habit goal can often become a means to accomplishing an achievement goal.  For example, one of my goals is to remain healthy–an achievement goal that will elude me if I don’t have a good habit of exercising every day and getting 7 – 8 hours of sleep each night.  So one of my 2017 habit goals is “Exercise 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week beginning on January 23, 2017, for 26 weeks.” (I figured it would take that long to establish it as a habit given my reluctance to exercise.) Another is “Get to bed at a time that will provide 7 hours of sleep each night starting on January 23, 2017 for 13 weeks.”  I was able to mark these off this quarter because those habits are now firmly installed.
Step #4: Understand the characteristics of each type.  Michael has developed his own variation of the SMART goal (I learned SMART goals 40 years ago in the Army).  He has suggested that both Habit and Achievement Goals need to be SMARTER:  Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Risky, Time-Keyed, Exciting, and Relevant.  “Risky?” you might ask.  He advises that our goals should be in our discomfort zone if we are to make significant progress in the chosen area of life. Our job as financial planners is often to help clients stay out of their delusional zone.  Notice that achievement goals and habit goals have different time-keys.  Achievement goals have a deadline whereas habit goals have a start date, habit frequency, time trigger, and streak target.
Step #5: Write the goal using the appropriate template.  Start with a verb (action), include the words that make it specific, measurable, risky and exciting, and end with by _________________ (the date).  An example would be Retire with no reduction in living standard by age 65.   A habit goal will also begin with a verb (the action) followed by the terms that make it measurable, risky, exciting, and specific. which are in turn followed by the habit frequency , time trigger, starting date and streak target.  An example might be Exercise (the action) every morning for at least 30 minutes, 5 days a week, (the measureable and exciting part) starting on July 18, (start date) for 26 weeks (the streak length which is the time that I think it will take to install the habit).
Often our financial planning recommendations are actually the short term goals that will lead toward the accomplishment of long term goals. For example, the planner might calculate and advise the client to spend not more than $X in order to reach the long term goal of retirement at a certain age.
If you haven’t set your goals using such framework, perhaps your next goal should be “Write my goals using a SMARTER framework by the end of this month.  Drop down and leave a comment or question.

News or noise?
Time to focus on what matters

The steady diet of headlines pouring out of Washington has been unsettling for many Americans, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum.  Even Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, jumped into the fray and wrote his first ever tweet criticizing President Donald Trump’s move to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate change agreement.  One has to ask whether he is truly interested in the environment, just wants to compete with Trump, or if GS holds a lot of Twitter stock, beaten down lately.
We all know that equity markets (stocks) hate heightened uncertainty. What is happening in Washington is generating an enormous amount of political uncertainty.  Even the word “impeachment” has been bandied about in conventional circles. Some pointed to that “news” to explain the one-day sell-off that caused the DOW to drop 373 points, last month.
But, political as well as international uncertainty has yet to translate into Main Street economic risk. It is here that you and I live.  To assess Main Street economic risk, we look at GDP (both nominal and real), household income, consumption, and nonresidential fixed investment. The standard deviation of those elements is a measure of economic risk.
According to Dr. Woody Brock, economic risk has decreased by well over 80% during the eight decades since 1930. Indeed, there was a spike in the ’00 decade, 2000-09. But so far each of the metrics, with the exception of household income, has shown a decrease in volatility (a standard measurement of risk) this decade. The economy has improved, from a riskiness standpoint.
Many will posit that the fundamentals of the economy, extrapolated from the news, drive the market. If that were the case, one could reasonably expect that the risk of the market would have also declined by more than 80% over those same decades. That simply hasn’t been the case. In that same period there has been only a 20% decline in market volatility (a standard measurement of risk).
Much will be said about the economy improving and that will likely be given as the reason for this or that happening in the market.  In reality, it is very difficult for anyone, including professionals, to make correct investment calls based on the news. That’s because mistakes in interpreting the news are rampant.
Remember when nearly everyone believed that house prices almost always go up and almost never drop. Furthermore, the price paid for a house didn’t really matter.  That led to overshoot of the price and the ultimate bursting of the bubble. We all now know that that belief, so widely held by investors, was a mistake. The news, in my opinion, represents mere noise.  Today, we must concern ourselves with the prevailing stories that may turn out to be wrong.
So what should we be concerned about today?  A possible list includes:

Excessive debt levels. Margin debt is at a record high and student loan debt now exceeds other forms of debt.
Increasing levels of pricing model uncertainty.  Discerning the true value of an investment today is quite different than it was a few years ago before the advent of today’s large, hi-tech companies.

Despite the frequent distractions from the popular press, we are keeping a firm eye on the market fundamentals, as well as the technical signals to navigate through these uncertain times. You might want to turn off the TV and enjoy your weekend and summer.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

About Us

What is your greatest financial concern right now?  As fee-only financial planners we provide sound analysis and recommendations that are in your best interest. We hold ourselves to a fiduciary standard always.  


How We Got Started

As a CPA, my mind tired of looking back and accounting for what happened last year.  An assessment of my strengths revealed that my brain is energized by looking forward--into the future.  Coupled with a talent for strategic thinking, I began making coherence out of chaos for our clients.  Our clients and I both became much happier.  


Our Ideal Customer

Specifically looking for boomers who are now caring for a parent or might be called upon to become a caregiver in the future.  We have a program called Partnering with my Parent.  It also works for boomers who want to plan for their own future.
