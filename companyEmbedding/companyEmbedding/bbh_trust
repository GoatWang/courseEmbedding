Yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the Fund than the total return quotation.Reflects the average of all the rates of the securities in a portfolio over a 7-day period and annualizes the result. The result is then converted into a percent (multiplied by 100).The 7-day current yield does not take into account the effects of compounding or expenses.Past performance does not guarantee future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the past performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For the most recent month-end performance, call 1 (800) 625-5769.On February 24, 2017 the name of the BBH International Equity Fund was changed to BBH Partner Fund - International Equity.
