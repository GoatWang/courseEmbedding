Prints in 3-5 business days


A cross between Dan Brown and Ben Elton with a healthy splash of David Icke.

Imagine a world where space travel, cellular regeneration, perfect engines, space travel, aliens, reincarnation and a host of other marvels are common place, but no-one but an elite few know about them. Amongst these elite few are God, Satan and group militaristic human Illuminati who are constantly playing a game with Satan over how the world is ordered.
Leonardo “Bingo” Ashman, a small time political activist eking out an existence in Brighton, lives in such a world, and who knows, maybe we do too. What he doesn’t know is he is very special and when he comes into possession of the Golden Cube, he is cast into a new and strange world with his travelling companion, a cellularly regenerated Queen Elizabeth II. The adventure leads them all over Western Europe and eventually to the Scottish Isles where the fate of all mankind rests in his hands.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
