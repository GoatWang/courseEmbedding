Mr. Mineff is a very professional attorney as well as an understanding attorney.  Mr. Mineff represented my daughter with relation to an OVI and let her know right from the beginning what to expect and guided her through the whole process in a very professional manner.  I felt what he charged was very very reasonable. Mr. Mineff is very well respected by his fellow colleagues and by his clients as well.  He has never never overcharged or racked up additional charges the entire time he represented my daughter.  I would highly recommend Mr. Mineff for any legal representation or advise.  Sliwinski Teddybernicecortes ratedI thank God for Mr. Sliwinski.  When I was in my twenties I made a mistake that got me in trouble.  He listened to me and did all that was in his power to get me out of.  He  made sure that even though at the time I was not thinking right,  I would  have a chance to a brighter future.  Since then and because of what he has done, I've been able to work in the banking industry without that hanging over my head.  Thank you so much Teddy for all you have done for me and my family!  For going above and beyond the call of duty.  And for still looking out for me after over 20 years.  You're the best!Luftman, Heck & AssociatesAndrew J. ratedAfter deciding that filing for bankruptcy would be my best option, Matt and the entire team have been nothing short of amazing. From the first meeting and thru the entire process and beyond all my questions or concerns were taken care of. I was never left to wonder what would happen next and they were always proactive in their approach while handling my case. I can not say enough about how professional they are and the peace of mind I had after that first meeting with them that everything will be taken care of which it was! They are the best. Mineff, George, JrEmily K. ratedA+; a real attorney who knows what he is doingI am franchise business owner who was referred from a friend 6 years ago to use George for a speeding violation. George is a phenomenal attorney; calls back right away with any questions, will spend as long as you need on the phone to make sure you understand everything, has a great staff that is very nice and actually have personalities. In life it's not always what you know, it's who you know...and you should know an attorney like George because he is a true professional and go-getter.Margolius Margolius & Associates LPAMark G. ratedI file disability May 3rd 2006 I got my paper the next day saying that I was denied I went straight to margolius sign a bunch of papers they took my case immediately it did take three years and eight months before I got my money but it was well worth the wait because I had crucial medical evidence to prove to the judge and to the court that I was disabled I got 3.8 years of back pay thanks for your help thanks for winning my case I highly recommend themW Scott Ramsey Law OfficeN B. ratedIf your not being represented by this attorney than your opinion is irrelevant. You fail to know all the details  about the case in question of "your friend".  Tell the entire story not your emotional self righteous judgment. Mostly you are bias. This attorney has not been in practice for 10 plus years because of something wrong. So, the suggestion to you, stop with the blame game. Your friend may have more issues than you know or spoken about in court.Mark R. Gusley & Associates LPAacidentertainment ratedFor a few years I was going through some terribly stressful litigation. Mark R Gusley was not only a great attorney, but a very approachable person who helped guide me both legally and personally. During an emotional time it was difficult o think about legal intricacies, but Mark R Gusley and Associates helped me get through successfully. Highly recommended. Baker Baker & Baker LLCKing S. ratedI have deal with Adam Baker for year my  my bankruptcy my criminal cases this been going on for over a few years it is very good service he has never let me down is very understanding an i apreciate their business very much I give them a five star recommendation thank you so much Mr Adam Baker and Jason BakerKeis George LLPKathleen M. ratedI did not know what to expect when I was trying to find a lawyer to help after the accident. Warren and Shaun and Ariel were the best. I recommend them for anyone looking for a lawyer that helps you after an injury or accident or you get hurt.Shaleika Vargas Attorney at LawLisa O. ratedAttorney Vargas represented me in a civil matter. I couldn't be happier with the outcome of my case. This lawyer is honest, hardworking and down to earth. Not to mention the price was very very affordable. I highly recommend this lawyer! Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Louisiana:













Does John C. Morrow carry a valid contracting license?



In Louisiana, all residential new construction of single family homes requires a contractor to be licensed as a residential building contractor. Home Improvement Contractors need to have a certificate (not a full license) to perform any home improvement contracting services over $7,500 but below $75,000.











How important is contractor licensing in Louisiana?



Louisiana requires contractors to pass a business and law exam. Continuing education is mandatory for all contractors before renewing their license. 











Your liability risk when hiring John C. Morrow



Louisiana requires contractors to maintain general liability insurance, and active workers' compensation policies. Be sure to request copies of certificates for both workers' compensation and general liability insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring John C. Morrow



Louisiana does not require homeowners to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners in Louisiana can file complaints with the State Licensing Board For Contractors by filling out a Consumer Complaint form. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Louisiana, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
