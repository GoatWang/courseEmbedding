Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. Of Louisiana Reports Results Of Operations For The Three And Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017






GlobeNewswire



Apr 27, 2017 4:30 PM EDT













 


















































 Shreveport, Louisiana, April 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Home Federal Bancorp, Inc. of Louisiana (the "Company") (Nasdaq: HFBL), the holding company of Home Federal Bank, reported net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $852,000, an increase of $78,000, or 10.1%, compared to net income of $774,000 reported for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company's basic and diluted earnings per share were $0.47 and $0.44, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.42 and $0.40, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The Company reported net income of $2.6 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $221,000, or 9.2%, compared to $2.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The Company's basic and diluted earnings per share were $1.44 and $1.38, respectively, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $1.27 and $1.22, respectively, for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 resulted primarily from an increase of $302,000, or 9.4%, in net interest income and a $10,000, or 1.3%, increase in non-interest income, partially offset by an increase of $119,000, or 4.3%, in non-interest expense, a $65,000, or 72.2%, increase in provision for loan losses, and a $50,000, or 13.2%, increase in the provision for income tax expense. The increase in net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $370,000, or 9.6%, increase in total interest income, partially offset by an increase of $68,000, or 10.5%, in aggregate interest expense primarily due to an increase in the average volume of interest bearing liabilities. The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to the increased level of non-performing assets discussed below. The Company's average interest rate spread was 3.44% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company's net interest margin was 3.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 3.75% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the average interest rate spread on a comparative quarterly basis was primarily the result of a decrease of fifteen basis points in average rate on interest-earning assets.  The decrease in net interest margin was primarily the result of a higher percentage increase in the average volume of interest-earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year quarterly period.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
