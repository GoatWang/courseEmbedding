Seven-time Grammy-winning Gospel music singer, songwriter and arranger Andrae Crouch died on January 8 at a hospital in Northridge, Calif. He was 72.
Crouch was forced to cancel a tour after contracting pneumonia last December, and suffered a heart attack on Jan. 3, according to a statement from his sister earlier this week. His death was first reported by USA Today.
Active since the 1960s, the Southern California native was notable for incorporating contemporary secular music styles into the Gospel tradition, helping to pave a path for much of contemporary Christian music in the process. Stevie Wonder, Elton John and Quincy Jones were among Crouch’s many secular music collaborators, and he conducted choir parts for such pop hits as Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” and Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror.”







Crouch began performing and writing music as a child, and his early group the Church of God in Christ Singers included future Beatles collaborator Billy Preston. (Crouch’s teenage composition “The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power” became a standard after the Church of God in Christ Singers recorded it in the late 1960s.) He later formed group Andrae Crouch and the Disciples, which cut several albums for the Light Records label, as well as recording as a solo artist. Other noteworthy Crouch compositions include “Soon and Very Soon,” “Bless His Holy Name,” “Jesus Is the Answer” (which appeared on a live Paul Simon album) and “I’ve Got Confidence” (covered by Elvis Presley in 1972).
In addition to his work with pop artists, Crouch also contributed original arrangements to films such as “The Color Purple” and “The Lion King,” as well as NBC series “Amen.” Crouch was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998, and he became only the third Gospel artist to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004.

Andrew Crouch Joins Zayo Group As President And COO






Business Wire




Apr 4, 2017 4:05 PM EDT













 


















































  Zayo Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ZAYO) announced today that it has named industry veteran Andrew Crouch as president and chief operating officer. Crouch's start date will be April 27.  Crouch will be a key member of the executive management team and will oversee Zayo's business operations. He will be based in Denver, Colorado and will report to Zayo's chairman and CEO Dan Caruso.  "My priority over the past year has been to assemble an invigorated post-IPO executive team," said Caruso. "Andrew is the capstone of this initiative to position Zayo for the future."  Crouch was most recently regional president of Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) for Level 3 Communications, where he also was responsible for its Global Accounts Division. Crouch joined Level 3 in 2001 and has since held a variety of executive positions leading marketing, product and commercial organizations, including regional president of North America and Asia-Pacific. Prior to joining Level 3, Crouch worked at British Telecom and Concert Communications, a joint venture between British Telecom and AT&T.  "Andrew rose through the sales and marketing functions, and has extensive global experience in running large scale organizations similar to Zayo," added Caruso, "He is exactly what Zayo needs to drive our continued growth as the global leader in communications infrastructure."  "Though I admire Zayo's track record, my focus is on where we can take Zayo over the next five years," said Crouch. "In a world that has an insatiable need for bandwidth, we will leverage Zayo's vast infrastructure to enable our customers to deliver innovative and impactful services." During the past 15 years, Crouch has worked with many Zayo executives, including Caruso.  Crouch will oversee Zayo's global Communications Infrastructure business which consists of Fiber Solutions, Transport, Enterprise Networks, and Colocation segments, and its Allstream business. Shared functions, such as Sales and Customer Service, will also report into Crouch.

Stats
Occupation: Singer / Songwriter Products: Myoplex® Phosphagen Results: Lost 52 pounds and 18% body fat *
Goal: Size and Strength



Andrew Crouch
In the music industry, your look is 80% of the business. The rest of it is the performance = ME! My energy, motivation, inspiration, passion, hope and spirit. I am a singer/songwriter who travels the country spreading hope and a positive message to my audiences, but I lost all hope in myself when I got out of bed one day, looked in the mirror, and barely recognized the reflection – I was about 40 pounds heavier than I had ever been. About a year before that day, I went to the Dr. because I was experiencing some serious back pain. The diagnosis wasn’t good when he said it was a herniated disk that was also pinching my sciatic nerve that runs down my leg. He suggested immediate surgery…I was going to be off my feet for a while. Against the advise of everyone, I wanted time to look into other options and I put off surgery. In the meantime, even the simplest day-to-day tasks were impossible: standing up, sitting down, sleeping, driving, walking, bending over…and exercise? Well, that was definitely out of the question. Of course I started getting heavier and heavier (because inside I was changing). With an upcoming wedding, I certainly couldn’t have a goal of being in the best shape of my life – I just wanted to be able to walk down the aisle. Over the course of just over a year, I had become clinically obese with 30% body fat, and a 46.5” waist. I couldn’t fit into any of my jeans for shows and I refused to go to size 40 pants. The extra weight caused even more problems for my back and I seemed stuck in an eternal circle…more weight caused more pain; more pain caused less exercise; less exercise cause more weight. I became less and less motivated and inspired. I couldn’t ven write songs anymore. All I had left was a low self-esteem, no confidence, minimal shows, and a guy I didn’t like looking at in the mirror…that doesn’t make for a good performance. THEN…I was challenged to do Body-for-LIFE® by my new father-in-law. So, I faced the challenge head on! As more and more people saw me transforming outside, they also noticed the transformation taking place inside, and could not help but ask me about it. Strangers and friends alike SWARMED as the weight fell off wanting to know what changed me, my body, and my life so drastically. It’s hard to help others when you are so focused on yourself. Body-for-LIFE® actually made me able to focus on others again, and my career. I am a walking billboard for Body-for-LIFE® – on and off the stage, inspiring so many to do what I did. Incredibly, my back is healed! It is amazing how a healthy diet, and the right exercises (plus losing 52 pounds) can change your entire life. I can run again! I can play sports again! I can perform again! I can hold my head high again! I have no pain, inside or out, since BFL!   I am now walking countless others through the BFL steps. The change in myself is astonishing, through BFL, I not only transformed my life, but I am able to help others transform theirs too. BFL is just that = For Life. It has given me the tools I need to live a healthy lifestyle. I have a new assurance in my talents and myself. Body-for-LIFE® showed me when I put my mind to anything and focus; I can accomplish it – whatever it is. I didn’t know that was in me before this. I have a barbarian approach to life now, since BFL, I can see my dreams, and insistently pursue them with unbridled drive. THANKS Bill Phillips and BFL team! May you be blessed as you have blessed so many others!!! *Individual results will vary

Massachusetts Criminal Law


							by admin 


Criminal Appeals

Attorney Crouch is a leading Boston criminal appeals attorney handles a range of civil and criminal appeals in both state and federal courts. He both writes briefs and appears at oral argument and hearings on behalf of his clients. Attorney Crouch has been an adjunct professor of law at New England School of Law, where he taught appellate advocacy skills to second-year law students. He has also served as a law clerk to the justices of the Massachusetts Superior Court and to the Honorable Mark Green of the Massachusetts Appeals Court. His background as a former clerk for the Massachusetts Appeals Court provides him with unique insight into the appellate process and assists in the crafting of persuasive arguments. Attorney Crouch has handled appellate matters ranging from misdemeanor state offenses to federal carjacking and murder convictions, as well as civil and administrative appellate matters. He has appeared in dozens of cases before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the Appeals Court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Criminal Appellate Process
A case does not end with the return of a jury or jury waived verdict. Following a conviction, a defendant has the right to challenge the verdict, either through a post-conviction motion or a direct appeal. 
To start an appeal, your attorney first files a Notice of Appeal. It is important that such notice be given within the relevant, often short, time limits set by law or your appellate rights may be lost. If you are contemplating an appeal, it is important to consult an attorney as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss the deadline.
Criminal Appeals Overview
A defendant seeking to challenge a conviction can seek a number of avenues of relief. The most common area is called a direct appeal, where a case is brought before an appellate court. In Massachusetts, there are two state appellate courts: the Appeals Court and the Supreme Judicial Court (sometimes referred to as the SJC). All cases are sent first to the Appeals Court, except certain cases (such as first-degree murder convictions), which proceed directly to the Supreme Judicial Court for review. Cases raising new or unusual legal issues may also be transferred for an initial hearing in the Supreme Judicial Court at the request of the parties or by the Supreme Judicial Court’s own order. Once the Appeals Court issues a decision, a party that disagrees with the result can petition the SJC to review the decision. While the Supreme Judicial Court ordinarily denies such requests, Attorney Crouch has successfully petitioned for further appellate review or rehearing in several cases.
Grounds on appeal may include whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction(s), challenges to incorrect jury instructions, the improper admission or exclusion of evidence, an improper closing argument by the Commonwealth’s attorney, or incorrect legal rulings on pre-trial motions (including motions to suppress, dismiss, or in limine). 
A defendant may also seek one of several other avenues for relief. A motion for a new trial can be brought in certain circumstances to challenge a jury’s verdict, the admission or exclusion of certain evidence at trial, to highlight the discovery of new evidence, or to raise specific legal errors. In the case of a guilty plea, a motion to withdraw the plea can be made if it was not voluntarily made, was the product of duress, or based upon the ineffective assistance of your former attorney. A defendant can also file a motion to challenge his sentence in a variety of ways, including motions to revise and revoke the sentence or to protest an illegal sentence.

In the case of a direct appeal, the case progresses through one of the state’s appellate courts. When the case is docketed or accepted by the court, the next crucial stage of the appeal is the writing of the appellate brief. This document contains a discussion of the facts involved in the case, an analysis of the legal issues raised and an argument in support of the position taken by the party who submits the brief. The appellant files the first brief, the party opposing the appeal (the “appellee”) files a responding brief and then the appellant, if necessary, can file a short reply. Once all of the briefs have been filed, the appellate court may schedule a court date to hear oral argument as to why the court should rule in that party’s favor.
If you are not successful at the state appellate level, there may be additional avenues of relief that may be pursued on your behalf. If a defendant loses his appeal before the Appeals Court, he may petition the Supreme Judicial Court in an application for further appellate review. This application details why the Appeals Court’s decision was in error. If three of the seven sitting Supreme Judicial Court justices agree to hear the case, the case may be heard by the court. If fewer than three justices vote to hear the case, the application will be denied.
