Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for DBX ETF Trust (NYSE:DBEF) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.
