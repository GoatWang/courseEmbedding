Luke was a pleasure to work for. I had a bit of a delay in uploading my final files and he was most understanding. If you have an opportunity to work for Luke, do it!

										The info shared in this report was when I was employed at CTI and things like email addresses, location, phone numbers could possibly be changed by this time.A the short time of my employment at CTI I witnessed that can no longer be kept quiet.CTI was comprised of Jason Gilbert and Lucas Hoppel, two partners that I did not know very well. No proof or knowledge that Jason knew what was going on. I met him a couple times and he is a sincere and knowledgeable person. Either way he is in the wrong because he either knew what was going on with his company and is at fault or he was too careless of a business owner to stay informed on how his managers were screwing over customers. He needed to over turn a lot of decisions that were made by Scott Labell.Scott Labell, a consultant hired for one thing. Numbers! All he cared about was writing numbers and that was it. For all you customers that weren't allowed a refund, that was the person saying no. jason was barely in the office and neither was Lucas. Home study courses, monthly charges, boot camps, the buck stopped with him. And for my employment there Scott never refunded anyone unless us employees sold a product for less than we were suppose to. Then we would get written up for discounting the product to help out a customer. Like I said all about numbers with Scott Labell.Charges. Lets start with the blueprints and the anatomy of a commercial short sale. They are now calling it there quickcash. What they did was charge you $7.37 for the shipping. Be careful when ordering because there is a box that you have to un check that says you agree to signing up for a monthly subscription of either $37.97 a month or $97.37 a month depending on when you ordered them. You have 30 days to cancel the monthly subscription. Now most customers were unaware of the charge. If you don't uncheck that box at the time of purchase and you don't cancel before 30 days you will be charged. And forget about a refund. Scott Labell wouldn't allow it. He didn't care if it over drafted your bank account.Home study courses and bootcamps. There is a 90 day money back guarantee. Great! You had to keep the course for 90 days. No returns before that time no matter what. Oh unless the product was discounted. God forbid us trying to save customers money in this economy. So after 90 days you had a 30 day window to return the product. So to recap between 90 and 120 days was your only option to refund. Any second later it was denied.Once a customer qualifies for a refund they are sent to customer service where a guy named Brian D was in charge of at the time.Oh he was fired to by the way with the explanation of "collecting a paycheck" and was an expense to the company that they no longer wanted to pay. He moved from New York, wait he drove from New York to relocate in California where he knew no one for a company that screwed him over and fired him.One of his jobs from Scott Labell was to talk customers into trying their course a little while longer, "hint" past their 30 day window, ultimately past the return policy of 120 days" so by the time this hopeless customer truss the course again, decides its really not for them, contacts CTI again, they would be past there 120 days. And once they were past their 120 days, at that point all refunds were denied by Scott Labell. Is that a rip off or what?I witnessed this with a Larry Graham, Scott had Larry on speaker phone while they went back and forth on refunding his home study course. He talked Larry into trying it out, they scheduled a call back a week later, a couple weeks after that Larry was out of his 30 day window and his refund was denied.As you can see here comes the upsell. First blueprints, then home study course, whats next? The live training events or bootcamps. The whole point is to get you excited to buy coaching. Mr Dutch Mendenhol and his team of sharks will burn into you aggressively to get you to buy coaching.Now for all you people who don't buy coaching at the event, you will get a call saying there are some slots left and Scott Labell will have one of his sales reps call you to get an idea if your serious about coaching. If you are you will be pitched by Scott Labell.An older employee, nice young kid told me that they have hired close to 100 sales reps. All but a couple were fired by Scott Labell because they weren't bringing in enough revenue for the company. And Jason condoned this type of management?Think twice about giving any information out money to a company who just doesn't screw over customers but also their employees, and most employees have families.This isn't for me to be contacted, I would like to offer my experiences so no one else has to go through this. Things may have changed but as long as Scott Labell is in the picture they have not changed one single thing. If I had kids I would bet my first born on that one.Thank you									    This report was posted on Ripoff Report on 01/19/2011 02:05 AM and is a permanent record located here:
