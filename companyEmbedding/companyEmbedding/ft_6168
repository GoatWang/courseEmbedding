 Products Built Tough 
 For those who don’t take the time to execute background checks on the dealers of portable toilets in Fort Knox, KY, there is a pretty good possibility you’ll lease or purchase a substandard device that doesn’t come with the features you need to have. At our company, we detest being given less than what we shell out cash for as much as you do, which is why we acquire our products from the world’s very best manufacturers.  Prior to acquiring our porta potties – and right after each time a porta potty is returned – we very carefully examine the unit/s for any damage or defects.   While straightforward, this extra step could save you from the encumbrance of having to exchange a defective toilet for another one!
 Our Products Are Packed with Modernized Features 
Without a doubt, functionality is something which all renters of portable toilets will need to consider prior to making a final buying or renting decision in Fort Knox, KY.   Also, contemplating where and what purpose the porta potty will be used for is required too.   For example, if you intend on leasing our products to give contractors employed in your industrial development or home their own lavatory, providing you with one of our walk-in restroom trailers is likely to be a rational solution.   In addition, this will make certain that the contractors won’t be using your home’s or establishment’s lavatories, thus safeguarding the privacy of you loved ones or coworkers.  But for circumstances wherein clients need a porta john for an occasion of less than 40 people, our company’s personnel will most likely suggest a small yet practical porta potty instead.
 A lot of the portable toilets provided by our company are loaded with features which great porta potties must have. This consists of the basics, such as standard water/waste capacity, piston pump action flushing, and an indicator that shows you when the product is full.   We also offer products with modern functions, like valves that lock in odors, lockable lids which prevent accidental spillages, and more. 
 Scoring High in the Looks Department
For a number of folks residing in Fort Knox, Kentucky, the actual look and feel are the biggest factors they take into consideration when shopping for portable toilets to lease or purchase.  If you feel you are this sort of buyer, know that our corporation can present you with precisely what you need to have.  We’ve acquired an array of porta potties that will suit the tastes of virtually any individual, in spite of how uncomplicated or refined his or her tastes may be. 
Outstanding Service 
 In Fort Knox, KY, the duration in which people rent our portable toilets is likely to vary considerably, but it doesn’t matter.   It certainly won’t matter if you demand to borrow our toilets for a couple of days, a few months, or on certain days all through the entire year – we’ll formulate special rental plans that’ll provide you with maximum use of our products when you need it. For individuals who do not have the time to collect and return the devices they rent, this won’t be a problem at all.   Your order will be brought to your site on the precise day you need it.   If returning the product is too much for you to manage, we will be happy to recover it for you. More importantly, it won’t make a difference as to where you live, as we have the resources and workforce to send your porta potties (no matter how many) to practically any location within the boundaries of Fort Knox, KY! 
For Additional Info, Phone Us Immediately 
Our company stands out from the other portable toilets suppliers in Fort Knox because we couple remarkable products with even greater service.  When you order from us, you can rest assured knowing that the porta potty you get is made by respected manufacturers, and has been meticulously inspected for defects by our own personnel.   To make things better, we aren’t money grubbing businessmen, which quite simply means you will acquire awesome value for every single dollar you pay us. With all that said, call us at 888-664-6168 to order a toilet now.

History of Christmas Lights



First Christmas tree with electric lights, 1882
 

Christmas lights have been one of the most popular Christmas decorations for the past century. In 1882, three years after Edison invented the first sensible light bulb, Edward H. Johnson created the first Christmas lights in his home in New York City. The tree was hand-wired and lit with 80 red, white, and blue globes. The lights blinked and twinkled while the tree slowly revolved.
Christmas lights were first made available for sale in 1890, but were so expensive that most people could not afford them. They were a symbol of status among the wealthy and many people rented lights instead of buying them. In 1903, one set of 24 Christmas lights sold for $12.00. Considering the average person made about $9 a week, this was far too extravagant for the normal family. In addition to the cost of the lights, the service of a wireman was required and, if the house was not electrically powered, they also needed a generator. 
Christmas lights did not become practical for the average family until the 1930s. By this time, not only were homes decorated with electric lights, stores, community Christmas trees, and government buildings were also adorned with the twinkling lights. General Electric began to sponsor community lighting competitions in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the 1950s that it was common to see rows of houses lit on the outside. Today, the places you find the lights are as numerous as the types of lights available.


Varieties of Christmas Lights
Mini string lights are the most popular because of their versatility. Available in either incandescent or LED technologies and in a wide range of color options, these Christmas lights are the perfect addition to almost any holiday lighting design. All of our mini string lights are very reliable and stay lit if a single bulb fails. Our incandescent mini string lights come with replacement lamps, and we carry LED testers and “PODS” for repairing the LED strings.
C7 and C9 string lights are an excellent choice for those that want a more classic feel for your holiday lighting. The difference between these types of Christmas lights is primarily the size of the bulb. The number after the “C” represents the diameter of the bulb in eighths of an inch, for example a C7 bulb is 7/8” or .875” in diameter. So the larger the number, the bigger the bulb. These string lights are available in several colors and in either LED or incandescent options. If you’re looking to customize the colors in your lighting design, we also offer C7/C9 light strands and bulbs sold separately.
Decorate mantles, wreaths, or even centerpieces in light without needing to worry about having a nearby outlet or running an extension cord with battery operated Christmas lights. From lit ribbons and InvisiLite strings to LED spheres and mini light strings, you’re sure to find the right battery operated Christmas lights for this holiday season.
You can’t go wrong with net lights or tree wrap lights for trees, columns, and bushes. Tree wrap lights are long and narrow; designed for tree trunks and columns. Net lights are shorter and wider which is better suited for bushes and shrubbery.
Don’t forget about the holiday greenery. Our selection of trees, wreaths, and garlands are available in unlit and pre-lit options. For the living room or lobby, we carry a wide variety of Christmas trees from realistic pine, fir, and spruce trees to tinsel trees available in several color options. Wreaths are a classic holiday addition for residential and commercial buildings. We offer a variety of sizes, styles, and colors for you to choose from. For mantles and banisters, browse our Christmas garlands offered in a range of lengths, bulb quantities, and colors to customize your holiday celebration.

                    Paradise to me is like leaving Chico and arriving a mini version of Tahoe. If you love the pine trees, the cooler summer air, great community and a smaller town with lots of personality. Come visit Paradise, we hope its all its name portrays it to be.

Description
This 50-foot spacer wire is specifically designed for use with the Diogen commercial grade LED lighting system. Using patented, state of the art technology, the splitter uses a coaxial connection that screws together with a coupling cap that makes it weatherproof so they are less likely to short out because of moisture or separate. This quick connect accessory lets the professional Christmas light installer create more design options without a reduction in lighting intensity.
