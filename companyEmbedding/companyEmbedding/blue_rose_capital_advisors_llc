Blue Rose Capital Advisors and John S. Vincent & Company Merge to Create a Stronger Financial Advisory Firm for Higher Education Institutions
Combined firm will serve the financial advisory needs of higher education institutions in a changing economic and operational landscape 


    
    MINNEAPOLIS, MN, January 15, 2015 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Blue Rose Capital Advisors and John S.

With the addition of John Vincent and his team, Blue Rose Capital Advisors has provided financial advisory services on over $90 billion worth of financings.

"We welcome John Vincent and his colleagues James McNulty, Jonathan Mieling and Patti Madro to our organization."

We both share a passion for meeting the needs of the institutions we serve."

"To work side-by-side with John and his team as a financial advisor serving mutual clients is a great privilege and opportunity."

Higher education institutions face a changing economic and operational environment which impacts their ability to secure, renew and restructure institutional debt. Well-managed transactions can improve creditworthiness, minimize debt service costs, and strengthen issuers for the future. Blue Rose Capital Advisors understands these challenges and delivers financial advisory services resulting in successful debt transactions and favorable financial outlooks for the institutions we serve.ABOUT BLUE ROSE CAPITAL ADVISORS
