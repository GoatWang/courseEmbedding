Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1965 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Collegeville, Minn. : The Liturgical Press 142 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 457925775

Item Description: AUTHORHOUSE, United States, 2006. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.Only monsters that prey upon children need fear the Advocate. But those who harm children should be very afraid, because the Advocate is coming for them. After each killing, the Advocate calls the police and taunts them, encouraging all decent people to protect our children. Soon copycat crimes start to occur across the country. Lt. Diego Santucci is assigned to stop the serial killings. In the Heartland of America he finds children are in as much danger from pedophiles and others who would harm them as anywhere else in the world and he sets out to do his job, while learning lessons that he never wanted to learn. Dr. Angel Akin is a child psychologist who is at the heart of his investigation, and not just because people tell her things . Akin does things to Santucci s heart and mind that he never believed possible. Does she help him find the killer or hinder him more to find the killer herself? The Advocate is designed to raise awareness of the problems that our children face every day and to promote advocacy for those who are in need. Proceeds from the sale of this book are donated to children s advocacy programs.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9781425928759

Captain William Henry O'Shea (1840 – 22 April 1905) was an Irish soldier and Member of Parliament.
Life[edit]
Born in Dublin, O'Shea was a captain in the 18th Hussars of the British Army.
Around 1880, his wife, Katharine O'Shea, entered into a relationship with Charles Stewart Parnell, with whom she had three children. O'Shea, who was already separated from his wife, knew of the relationship. He only filed for divorce in 1890 after her aunt, from whom he was expecting a large inheritance, died in 1889 leaving her estate in trust for his wife (thus allegedly violating the terms of O'Shea's marriage contract). However, that will was overturned upon appeal, and the aunt's legacy was shared among Katharine O'Shea's siblings.
After the divorce the two surviving children of CS Parnell and Katherine O'Shea were given into Captain O'Shea's custody.
O'Shea was MP for Clare from 1880 to 1885 and Galway Borough for a short period in 1886. Although supported by Parnell, he was never a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party.
