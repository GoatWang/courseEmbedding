            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Performance Food Group

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Performance Food Group Company (NASDAQ: PFGC) is an American company that was founded in 1875. Headquartered in Goochland County, Virginia (just outside Richmond), the company distributes a range of food products.
In 2008, the company announced it was to be acquired by Wellspring Capital Management and Blackstone Group for $1.3 billion.[1][2] Two other foodservice companies owned by the private equity firms, snack food distributor Vistar and Italian foodservice company Roma Foods, were then merged into PFG. PFG went public in 2015.[3]

Improving Efficiency


Improving Efficiency
We focus on reducing miles-per-gallon and miles driven
Our fleet covers millions of miles a year so we focus on improving efficiency by reducing our diesel fuel usage on a relative basis. We have installed tools and systems to monitor idle time and to track performance by driver in order to improve fuel efficiency. We also work to reduce the amount of miles we drive by implementing efficient routing practices and focusing on improving trailer utilization.  Finally, we are constantly looking at the specifications of our tractors and trailers to improve aerodynamics to further improve the efficiency of our equipment.





Fighting Hunger In America


Fighting Hunger In America
Donating 1 million pounds of food annually
As a proud sponsor of Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger relief organization, we donate more than a million pounds of food annually to help fight hunger. We also support local food banks through product donations, food drives, volunteerism, board memberships and financial donations. Our associates volunteer their time working in warehouses, conducting food drives and raising funds. We encourage our experts to share their knowledge about food and distribution so we can help build better processes and efficiencies for feeding the hungry. 





Recycling and Reducing Energy Use


Recycling and Reducing Energy Use
Working to minimize our carbon footprint
We know reducing electrical energy use in our facilities is important. By installing LED lights in our warehouses, we reduced the amount of energy used for lighting by 40%. We also use hi-tech energy management systems to monitor and adjust our energy usage during peak periods.
We recycle paper, glass and aluminum in our administrative facilities and in our warehouses we recycle cardboard, pallets, corrugate and stretch wrap. We also recycle the water that's used to clean our trucks.



 



 
 







Seeking New Ways To Be Sustainable
Our Performance Foodservice – NorthCenter operating company in Augusta, Maine, is powered 100% by wind through Renewable Energy Credits and partners with the EPA’s SmartWay program to reduce the environmental impact of its truck fleet.

More Than 100 Years Of Foodservice Excellence
We are established experts who evolve with the times
Our roots go back to 1885 when James Capers began peddling groceries for a wholesaler in Richmond, Va. His business grew into Pocahontas Foods, which distributed branded products to restaurants and foodservice outlets across the United States.

We continued to grow and evolve through the mid-1980’s when our leaders had a vision for a new company that would bring together a network of distributors with the corporate support to become an industry giant. Performance Food Group was born in 1987. Today we have three divisions—Performance Foodservice, Vistar and PFG Customized—each of which focuses on delivering delicious food and excelling at customer service.




Change is Our Competitive Advantage 
A Long History of Reinvention 
Over the years we have listened to our customers and transformed to better support their needs. Each division has its own success story, but they all carry the same theme—adaptation. We don’t just show our customers what’s happening today, we show them what’s coming next.

Employee Spotlight
Ralph Wright, Driver, Performance Foodservice - Hickory
Ralph Wright has been a driver for our location in Hickory, North Carolina, since 1981 and a few years ago he retired from the National Guard after 35 years of service. During that time, he not only supported the citizens of North Carolina during natural disasters, he also completed two deployments to Iraq and was awarded the Purple Heart after being injured during his first tour of duty. Both times, Performance Foodservice welcomed him back with open arms, encouraging him to do what was necessary to serve his country.
Without the support of my employer and family, I couldn’t have served and accomplished what I have.










 


Employee Spotlight
Mott Willis, Warehouse Manager, Performance Foodservice - Powell
Mott served nearly four years in the U.S. Air Force stationed in Alaska where he listened to and monitored Soviet military Morse code broadcasts. Just months after leaving the military in 1987, he was hired as a fork lift operator at a predecessor company to our Performance Foodservice location in Georgia. Twenty-nine years later, Mott is now a warehouse manager there after advancing through several positions with added responsibility.
PFG has allowed me to grow in my role, which enabled me to advance my career.  It’s been a great fit for me and my family.










 


Employee Spotlight
Ernesto, Area Manager, Performance Foodservice - Caro
After the events on September 11, 2001, Ernesto wanted to serve his country and joined the U.S. Navy Reserve. In 2009, he joined Performance Foodservice as an area manager. When he was tagged for mobilization in 2012, his team encouraged him to serve his country and sent him care packages while he was deployed in Kabul, Afghanistan. When he returned home in 2014, he was welcomed back by his family, friends, coworkers and customers.
On behalf of my coworkers and servicemen employed by PFG, words cannot express our gratitude for the support and for allowing us to answer the call to serve our nation.

Improving Efficiency


Improving Efficiency
We focus on reducing miles-per-gallon and miles driven
Our fleet covers millions of miles a year so we focus on improving efficiency by reducing our diesel fuel usage on a relative basis. We have installed tools and systems to monitor idle time and to track performance by driver in order to improve fuel efficiency. We also work to reduce the amount of miles we drive by implementing efficient routing practices and focusing on improving trailer utilization.  Finally, we are constantly looking at the specifications of our tractors and trailers to improve aerodynamics to further improve the efficiency of our equipment.





Fighting Hunger In America


Fighting Hunger In America
Donating 1 million pounds of food annually
As a proud sponsor of Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger relief organization, we donate more than a million pounds of food annually to help fight hunger. We also support local food banks through product donations, food drives, volunteerism, board memberships and financial donations. Our associates volunteer their time working in warehouses, conducting food drives and raising funds. We encourage our experts to share their knowledge about food and distribution so we can help build better processes and efficiencies for feeding the hungry. 





Recycling and Reducing Energy Use


Recycling and Reducing Energy Use
Working to minimize our carbon footprint
We know reducing electrical energy use in our facilities is important. By installing LED lights in our warehouses, we reduced the amount of energy used for lighting by 40%. We also use hi-tech energy management systems to monitor and adjust our energy usage during peak periods.
We recycle paper, glass and aluminum in our administrative facilities and in our warehouses we recycle cardboard, pallets, corrugate and stretch wrap. We also recycle the water that's used to clean our trucks.



 



 
 







Seeking New Ways To Be Sustainable
Our Performance Foodservice – NorthCenter operating company in Augusta, Maine, is powered 100% by wind through Renewable Energy Credits and partners with the EPA’s SmartWay program to reduce the environmental impact of its truck fleet.

More Than 100 Years Of Foodservice Excellence
We are established experts who evolve with the times
Our roots go back to 1885 when James Capers began peddling groceries for a wholesaler in Richmond, Va. His business grew into Pocahontas Foods, which distributed branded products to restaurants and foodservice outlets across the United States.

We continued to grow and evolve through the mid-1980’s when our leaders had a vision for a new company that would bring together a network of distributors with the corporate support to become an industry giant. Performance Food Group was born in 1987. Today we have three divisions—Performance Foodservice, Vistar and PFG Customized—each of which focuses on delivering delicious food and excelling at customer service.




Change is Our Competitive Advantage 
A Long History of Reinvention 
Over the years we have listened to our customers and transformed to better support their needs. Each division has its own success story, but they all carry the same theme—adaptation. We don’t just show our customers what’s happening today, we show them what’s coming next.

The department is divided into core groups. The IT development team handles the company's various applications uploads to the cloud. The IT strategy group maintains strategy, governance, and project management initiatives. The systems and networks divisions oversee new implementations and daily operations for networks and systems. The enterprise operations and development division is responsible for developing and maintaining applications critical to Performance Food Group's business' needs.
