America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. Appoints Chad Daffer As Its Chief Executive Officer






GlobeNewswire



Sep 25, 2015 8:22 AM EDT













 




























































 OMAHA, Neb., Sept. 25, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On September 22, 2015, Mark A. Hiatt voluntarily resigned as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") of America First Multifamily Investors, L.P. (NASDAQ:ATAX) ("ATAX" or the "Company"), effective as of September 30, 2015. Mr. Hiatt has been employed in various capacities with The Burlington Capital Group, LLC ("Burlington") throughout his nearly 29 year tenure and believes this is the right time for him to pursue other interests. "ATAX has achieved great success since its inception," said Hiatt. "I would like to thank the unitholders for their support and the Company is in good hands as we make this transition."  In conjunction with Mr. Hiatt's departure, on September 25, 2015, the Board of Managers of Burlington, the general partner of the general partner of ATAX, has appointed Chad L. Daffer as the Chief Executive Officer of ATAX, effective October 1, 2015. Daffer has been employed by Burlington since January 1, 2005, working closely with Hiatt while serving as ATAX's Fund Manager. Daffer has over twenty-five years of experience in Investment Banking, Fixed Income Institutional Sales, credit analysis and structuring, underwriting and the placement of debt instruments.  "As ATAX's Fund Manager for nearly 11 years, I have been able to actively participate in the development of the Company's strategic direction," said Daffer. "As I begin in my new role I look forward to working closely with our unitholders, our Board of Managers and our management team to execute on dynamic and transformational opportunities for ATAX."  Lisa Roskens, Chairman and CEO of Burlington, stated, "Mark's years of service and dedication have had a powerful impact on ATAX. Chad has worked closely with Mark for almost 11 years and I believe ATAX, under Chad's direction, will continue to expand its core business and move the Company forward. Chad's extensive financial background and the success he has achieved in his capacity as the Company's Fund Manager makes him uniquely qualified to be ATAX's CEO."
