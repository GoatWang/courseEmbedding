Early life
Jeffree Star was born in Orange County, California.[citation needed] His father died when Star was 6 years old and he subsequently was raised solely by his mother, a model who frequently went on assignments. As a child, Star began regularly experimenting with his mother's makeup and convinced her to let him wear it to school when he was in junior high.[2] He moved to Los Angeles following his graduation from high school, supporting himself with various makeup, modeling, and music jobs.[6][7] He later recalled spending his time on weekends "using a fake ID to attend Hollywood clubs dressed in mini dresses and nine inch high heels, where celebrities would contract [Star] for makeup work at their homes".[8] Star reports that his weekend socializing at clubs and the makeup advice he offered eventually led to his modeling career.[8]
Career
Star used popular social networking website MySpace to further both his music as well as fashion design career. He also used MySpace for blogging about his life, while making social commentary on "self-image and confidence",[9] fame, beauty, and life. Star had built up a fan base on several websites but convinced many to join him on MySpace, giving his profile a large number of followers from the beginning. His MySpace photoshoots would frequently get over 50,000 comments when posted.[2] Star also gained fame as one of the most popular unsigned artists, with the daily rankings placing him in the top tier on MySpace.[10]
Star's music career as an electronica and pop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches' drummer Samantha Maloney, who encouraged him to make music.[2] During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,[11] which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.[12] The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month.[12] Star released his first and only studio album Beauty Killer in 2009, and appeared in the second version of Kesha's music video "Take It Off" in 2010.[13] Star has worked with several other musical performers, including Blood on the Dance Floor, Deuce,[14] Millionaires,[15] and Larry Tee.[16]
Personal life
Star resides in Los Angeles with his boyfriend, Nathan Schwandt.[17][18]

Star's music career as an electronica and pop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches' drummer Samantha Maloney, who encouraged him to make music.[2] During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,[11] which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.[12] The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month.[12] Star released his first and only studio album Beauty Killer in 2009, and appeared in the second version of Kesha's music video "Take It Off" in 2010.[13] Star has worked with several other musical performers, including Blood on the Dance Floor, Deuce,[14] Millionaires,[15] and Larry Tee.[16]
Personal life

Early life
Jeffree Star was born in Orange County, California.[citation needed] His father died when Star was 6 years old and he subsequently was raised solely by his mother, a model who frequently went on assignments. As a child, Star began regularly experimenting with his mother's makeup and convinced her to let him wear it to school when he was in junior high.[2] He moved to Los Angeles following his graduation from high school, supporting himself with various makeup, modeling, and music jobs.[6][7] He later recalled spending his time on weekends "using a fake ID to attend Hollywood clubs dressed in mini dresses and nine inch high heels, where celebrities would contract [Star] for makeup work at their homes".[8] Star reports that his weekend socializing at clubs and the makeup advice he offered eventually led to his modeling career.[8]
Career
Star used popular social networking website MySpace to further both his music as well as fashion design career. He also used MySpace for blogging about his life, while making social commentary on "self-image and confidence",[9] fame, beauty, and life. Star had built up a fan base on several websites but convinced many to join him on MySpace, giving his profile a large number of followers from the beginning. His MySpace photoshoots would frequently get over 50,000 comments when posted.[2] Star also gained fame as one of the most popular unsigned artists, with the daily rankings placing him in the top tier on MySpace.[10]
Star's music career as an electronica and pop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches' drummer Samantha Maloney, who encouraged him to make music.[2] During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,[11] which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.[12] The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month.[12] Star released his first and only studio album Beauty Killer in 2009, and appeared in the second version of Kesha's music video "Take It Off" in 2010.[13] Star has worked with several other musical performers, including Blood on the Dance Floor, Deuce,[14] Millionaires,[15] and Larry Tee.[16]

Early life
Jeffree Star was born in Orange County, California.[citation needed] His father died when Star was 6 years old and he subsequently was raised solely by his mother, a model who frequently went on assignments. As a child, Star began regularly experimenting with his mother's makeup and convinced her to let him wear it to school when he was in junior high.[2] He moved to Los Angeles following his graduation from high school, supporting himself with various makeup, modeling, and music jobs.[6][7] He later recalled spending his time on weekends "using a fake ID to attend Hollywood clubs dressed in mini dresses and nine inch high heels, where celebrities would contract [Star] for makeup work at their homes".[8] Star reports that his weekend socializing at clubs and the makeup advice he offered eventually led to his modeling career.[8]
Career
Star used popular social networking website MySpace to further both his music as well as fashion design career. He also used MySpace for blogging about his life, while making social commentary on "self-image and confidence",[9] fame, beauty, and life. Star had built up a fan base on several websites but convinced many to join him on MySpace, giving his profile a large number of followers from the beginning. His MySpace photoshoots would frequently get over 50,000 comments when posted.[2] Star also gained fame as one of the most popular unsigned artists, with the daily rankings placing him in the top tier on MySpace.[10]
Star's music career as an electronica and pop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches' drummer Samantha Maloney, who encouraged him to make music.[2] During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,[11] which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.[12] The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month.[12] Star released his first and only studio album Beauty Killer in 2009, and appeared in the second version of Kesha's music video "Take It Off" in 2010.[13] Star has worked with several other musical performers, including Blood on the Dance Floor, Deuce,[14] Millionaires,[15] and Larry Tee.[16]
Personal life
Star resides in Los Angeles with his boyfriend, Nathan Schwandt.[17][18]

Hi.
My name is Jeffree Star. I discovered makeup at the age of 13 and have been obsessed with it ever since. I used to copy looks from fashion ads in my mother's Cosmopolitan magazines and steal her eye shadows. When I graduated high school, I moved an hour north from Orange County, California to Los Angeles. I worked at makeup counters, freelanced and worked on many celebrities, music videos, fashion editorials and weddings. Now I teach makeup classes around the world and share my secrets that I've learned through over 10 years of experience. Playing with cosmetics is my favorite thing to do and I started to create my own formulas years ago but only wore them on myself & put them on my best friends. It's been a dream of mine since I discovered my first lipstick, to create and own my very own brand. My goal is to create products that do exactly what they say and that actually last!
So many of you have asked what's next! I love lips, so I wanted to make the most light weight liquid-to-matte lipstick on the market! I'm already creating new colors that will be out shortly!! Also, regular lipsticks, lip scrubs, highlighters,and eye shadow palettes are being developed next!I hope you all enjoy the pink blood, sweat, and tears that go into every product I make! My brand is for anyone who's fearless enough to be their own person. Let's inspire each other to stay true to who we are and have fun doing it!
Love + Beauty, Jeffree Star

You will be notified via email at the email address listed on your account when your order was placed. Please note that your banking institution may require additional time to process and post this transaction to your account once they have received the information from us (typically 3-­5 business days).
We can only issue a refund to the original form of payment used at the point of purchase. In the event you no longer have access to this account or it is no longer active, we will then process your refund in the form of a check mailed to the address in your customer profile which can take 4-6 weeks to process. Original shipping charges are nonrefundable.



What do you do with returned products?

They go directly to makeup heaven AKA the trash! RIP.



Do you offer makeup artist pro discounts?

At this time, we do not!



Where do you ship from?

Los Angeles, California



How many items can I order per month?

Please note that all of our products are limited to 2 PER each shade (or item) for every PERSON per month unless otherwise stated. Our store is setup to block any orders that contain more than this quantity for a product, however if you exceed this limit, your order will be automatically cancelled and refunded in full.
We do this to ensure that everyone has a fair chance to enjoy these products, so please be mindful of this!!



How much is shipping?

All shipping rates will vary depending on a few different factors, some of which include:

Domestic vs International shipments
Total weight of package
Selected shipping method

We ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE for ANY fees required by customs for any reason. All shipping fees we require will be clearly shown to you alongside the service and estimated transit time upon checkout.



Are your products cruelty-free?

Yes, our whole line is cruelty-free! Makeup is for humans, not animals. We have also researched our manufactures and know 100% they don’t affiliate or get ingredients from places that are not cruelty-free!



How long does shipping take?

Our hours of operation for shipping are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. PST, excluding weekends and major USA holidays. Orders will ship 1­-2 business day after you order. *NOTE: during restocks & new releases, there can be an additional 2-4 business days of processing time!

Our makeup is manufactured in Los Angeles with no imported ingredients.



Is there a smell to the Velour Liquid Lipsticks?

For those that have been supporting us from day one, you know we have never added fragrance to our products, until recently! Most liquid lip shades have the smell of what we call “raw ingredients” which has a ‘chemical like’ fragrance to it! Nothing is wrong with the lipstick, we just didn’t mask it with something! SHADES WITH ROOTBEER FLOAT fragrance are Celebrity Skin, Unicorn Blood, Breakfast At Tiffany’s, Abused, Gemini, Rose Matter, Mannequin & Blue Velvet. 



When will my favorite Jeffree Star product be back in stock?

Jeffree always announces his current re-stocks on his social media. Please subscribe for all announcements.



I couldn't find the answer I'm looking for here, what do I do now?

Send your name, JSC order number (if applicable), and question to customerservice@jeffreestarcosmetics.com.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Early life
Jeffree Star was born in Orange County, California.[citation needed] His father died when Star was 6 years old and he subsequently was raised solely by his mother, a model who frequently went on assignments. As a child, Star began regularly experimenting with his mother's makeup and convinced her to let him wear it to school when he was in junior high.[2] He moved to Los Angeles following his graduation from high school, supporting himself with various makeup, modeling, and music jobs.[6][7] He later recalled spending his time on weekends "using a fake ID to attend Hollywood clubs dressed in mini dresses and nine inch high heels, where celebrities would contract [Star] for makeup work at their homes".[8] Star reports that his weekend socializing at clubs and the makeup advice he offered eventually led to his modeling career.[8]
Career
Star used popular social networking website MySpace to further both his music as well as fashion design career. He also used MySpace for blogging about his life, while making social commentary on "self-image and confidence",[9] fame, beauty, and life. Star had built up a fan base on several websites but convinced many to join him on MySpace, giving his profile a large number of followers from the beginning. His MySpace photoshoots would frequently get over 50,000 comments when posted.[2] Star also gained fame as one of the most popular unsigned artists, with the daily rankings placing him in the top tier on MySpace.[10]
Star's music career as an electronica and pop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches' drummer Samantha Maloney, who encouraged him to make music.[2] During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,[11] which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.[12] The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month.[12] Star released his first and only studio album Beauty Killer in 2009, and appeared in the second version of Kesha's music video "Take It Off" in 2010.[13] Star has worked with several other musical performers, including Blood on the Dance Floor, Deuce,[14] Millionaires,[15] and Larry Tee.[16]
Personal life
Star resides in Los Angeles with his boyfriend, Nathan Schwandt.[17][18]

Jeffree Star was born in Orange County, California.[citation needed] His father died when Star was 6 years old and he subsequently was raised solely by his mother, a model who frequently went on assignments. As a child, Star began regularly experimenting with his mother's makeup and convinced her to let him wear it to school when he was in junior high.[2] He moved to Los Angeles following his graduation from high school, supporting himself with various makeup, modeling, and music jobs.[6][7] He later recalled spending his time on weekends "using a fake ID to attend Hollywood clubs dressed in mini dresses and nine inch high heels, where celebrities would contract [Star] for makeup work at their homes".[8] Star reports that his weekend socializing at clubs and the makeup advice he offered eventually led to his modeling career.[8]
Career
Star used popular social networking website MySpace to further both his music as well as fashion design career. He also used MySpace for blogging about his life, while making social commentary on "self-image and confidence",[9] fame, beauty, and life. Star had built up a fan base on several websites but convinced many to join him on MySpace, giving his profile a large number of followers from the beginning. His MySpace photoshoots would frequently get over 50,000 comments when posted.[2] Star also gained fame as one of the most popular unsigned artists, with the daily rankings placing him in the top tier on MySpace.[10]
Star's music career as an electronica and pop vocalist began when he befriended Peaches' drummer Samantha Maloney, who encouraged him to make music.[2] During the summer of 2007, Star was advertised as a part of the True Colors Tour 2007,[11] which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.[12] The tour, sponsored by the LGBT Logo channel, began on June 8, 2007 to coincide with Pride month.[12] Star released his first and only studio album Beauty Killer in 2009, and appeared in the second version of Kesha's music video "Take It Off" in 2010.[13] Star has worked with several other musical performers, including Blood on the Dance Floor, Deuce,[14] Millionaires,[15] and Larry Tee.[16]
Personal life
Star resides in Los Angeles with his boyfriend, Nathan Schwandt.[17][18]

The pigmentation is to die for, one sweep is all I need to cover my lips. They also last all day, I can eat meals, drink etc and this does not budge yet it isn't too hard to remove at the end of the day. The colour range is amazing, they have something for all skin tones. The smell is very neutral, not off putting however doesn't smell amazing but definitely not something that bothers me, the texture on the lips isn't bad, however by the end of the day, if you have dry lips they will feel very flaky and dry however adding another layer usually stops this.These are my holy grail lipsticks and I've tried mac, NYX, rimmel etc. And none come close to these! The price isn't bad and on Beauty Bay they usually have 2 for 1 or buy one get one half price offers on so don't forget to check there! 		     Report Abuse           				Gendarmerie				   on  7/12/2017 12:53:00 PM   More reviews by Gendarmerie    Age: 30-35 Skin: Other, Other, Not Sure Hair: Other, Other, Other Eyes: Other     			First of all, I want to rave about Flamboyant.  This is coral but not as loud as you'd think "flamboyant" would be.  Kind of bright but not annoyingly bright.  They call it a metallic but it's micro-glitter so it is not chunky.  I wear it to work.  It is the best liquid lipstick I've ever had.  It smells like strawberries!  The metallic formula is kind of fluffy so I had to get used to that.  The mattes are more liquid and easier to apply, but Flamboyant is not drying at all.   After the mattes dry down, many of them look dry (and some of them feel kind of dry).  If you like summer corals, this is a home run and the metallic formula is the best.In fact the only complaint I have is that the formula of the Velour Liquid Lipsticks varies from shade to shade.  Some of them smell like strawberries or root beer, some of them have no noticeable fragrance, and others have a strong paint smell.  Some have a thinner texture than others, so you almost have to try them all in person, and not many stores have Jeffree Star.            I also bought Calabasas and Butt Naked.  Calabasas is a cranberry pink, and it looks good on everyone.  It's Jeffree's regular matte formula so it is easy to apply and it dries down flat and darker than it looks when wet.  It is not scented, though.  I wish all of the summer collection lipsticks smelled like Flamboyant.Butt Naked is very, very pale.  It's basically a light foundation color but with some peach in it.  There is no fragrance.  I almost returned this one, but when I mixed it with Calabasas I got an interesting lighter pink so then I decided to keep them all.  The brand is cruelty free and vegan so that's a plus.    I'm giving Flamboyant a perfect five.  I'd really like to give Calabasas four-and-a-half out of five because it is drier, and Butt Naked a three because it is a tough color to wear.  But Jeffree Star's liquid lipsticks are the best I've tried.  They don't crumble at all.  I'll definitely buy more colors.

When it wears off doesn't crumble, but I find that it stays put on lips even if you eat, drink etc. After 7 hrs of wear it only came off from the inner rim of my mouth, wasn't really noticeable. It has a cooling effect on the lips. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the package but it doesn't bother me. Price is kinda steep, but I'd rather buy this again than many other similar priced products. Only con is that the shade looks more sparkly/metallic on the website than in real life.

They're super hydrating, while still having a matte finish. The packaging is really well done, the price point definitely isn't bad at all, and the color selection is so diverse. Jeffree has colors ranging from your every day neutrals, to crazy neon colors as well. I love that they're vegan as well, and the coverage is really great. The lipsticks always make my average looking lips look huge! I'd definitely recommend these to just about anyone of any age.

Weirdo comes off on EVERYTHING   and is so smudgy, I much prefer the black from Makeup Monsters. Unicorn blood is a beautiful colour but I found it to be so streaky. Some of my older ones ie hoehoehoe from the 2015? christmas LE collection have dried up to the point where they are unusable.Androgyny is by far my favourite and I have bought a second one. Over the last year or so he seems to have improved the formula A LOT it is way creamier and easier to apply, also dries down a lot better. My first androgyny also from the xmas collection became really oily and thin over time but my second one purchased a few months ago is perfect. Overall I do love my collection and I kind of feel bad about that because he is so disliked by people in the makeup community but to be honest I buy the product for the quality not who makes it. I would recommend giving the lipsticks a try as like I said the quality is way better now than it used to be. I have tried makeup monsters, kvd, colourpop, lime crime and too faced. JS and makeup monsters are my favourites by far		     Report Abuse  1 of 1 people found this helpful.         				pieceofcake14				   on  6/9/2017 1:06:00 PM   More reviews by pieceofcake14    Age: 19-24 Skin: Dry, Fair-Medium, Not Sure Hair: Red, Other, Other Eyes: Blue     			Shades I own:Designer BloodAndrogynyChrysanthemum- Packaging: I enjoyed the packaging and had no issues with it, I really like the doe-foot applicator especially since these ones have a small dip in the center to collect more product. Tight seal around the wand on all off my lip colors.-Formula: All three of my shades apply VERY differently, Chrysanthemum is very chunky (thick pieces of gold glitter) which makes it very hard to apply as it leaves it looking streaky with no way of fixing it. Designer Blood & Chrysanthemum feel drying on the lips. As for Androgyny I feel like it was almost made by another brand..? It applies much easier, not too thin or thick and doesn't feel drying whatsoever. -Scent: This is the portion I had issues with... Designer Blood and Chrysanthemum smelt almost sweet? No issues with them. But my favorite shade Androgyny smelt like..... cat piss? I'm in the veterinary field and I KNOW what cat pee smells like and I cringe every time I put it on, but once it dries the smell fades away. Overall I honestly can't picture myself buying another liquid lip from Jeffree Star again. 		     Report Abuse  3 of 4 people found this helpful.

I really love them because they are long lasting and kiss proof! I have three shades: Dirty Money, No Tea no Shade and Sagittarius. If you have really dry lips, I wouldnât recommend it because they are drying down so this might be uncomfy for you.

I purchased this directly from the Jeffree Star website (well actually two of the Leo- one for me, one for my daughter who was away at school). When she let me know that the tube was defective I told her to email them. She did and got no response. So, I emailed them since I was the one to order the lipstick. The order was placed in mid March and my email went out to them on June 1. What I was first told was to send them a picture of the defective product and a copy of the invoice (I printed a copy from the website).  The response I received from them was: "We are sorry to hear about the current condition of your product and wish we could do more to assist you, but given the amount of time that has passed since the date of delivery we are unable to process refunds or replacements regarding your claim. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!"Yes, that is a direct quote from the email I received from the Jeffree Star Customer Service.  I cannot, no matter how much I love a product, purchase from a company that does not stand behind the quality of their products (and over the past 6 months my daughter and I have bought about 25 or so of their liquid lipsticks and both bought the androgyny eyeshadow palette plus other items from them). Buyer beware! If your tube is defective they will not stand behind their product!!!

They are by far the most comfortable ones I have ever used. The shade selection is great and so is the packaging. Furthermore I think the price is reasonable. I have 7 shades and this would be my favourite liquid lipstick brand, if it wasn't for the terrible inconsistencies!- Inconsistency in Packaging: I have some that have a super fluffy applicator but no sifter hole and I have others that have a sifter hole but a less fluffy applicator. The boxes and ingredients vary, too. I never know what I'll get. I have already tried to reach out to JSC but it was worthless. - Inconsistency in Formula: Some are thin and liquidy, others are very goopy and thick. (I'm looking at you Masochist!) Again, I have no idea what I'll get! The inconsistencies are not only from shade to shade but also within a shade.- Inconsistency in Smell: Some smell like root bear float, which I love. Others smell slightly chemically, which I can live with. But some others straight up smell like burnt  plastic, which I don't have a sensible nose but that's too much, even for me. I know he has a list of which ones are fragranced, but what's up with the rest? Why do some of them smell so funky?QUALITY CONTROL seems to be a BIG ISSUE. Not only with his lipsticks but also with his highlighters. Until they have fixed this, I don't see myself buying from them anymore. 		     Report Abuse  5 of 5 people found this helpful.

I would recommenced these to anyone. They beat colourpop and kylie by a mile.
