Terms of Use
Shipping and Returns Policy
We want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If you ever have a problem with your order, please contact us at shopsupport@nrg.com.
Shipping Information

Orders typically ship via UPS Ground 3-5 days after processing.
New Home Automation customers should receive products within 3 weeks of ordering.
Orders are shipped Monday through Friday with the exception of recognized U.S. federal holidays.
International shipping is not available.

While the above indicates typical shipping times, NRG Connected Home LLC does not guarantee that the above shipping times will be met and assumes no liability under any legal or equitable theory for failure to adhere to the above shipping schedule and makes no guarantee of the date upon which any products will arrive.
Returns/Refunds/Exchanges
We hope you are satisfied with your products, but we understand that circumstances arise that may require returns or exchanges.
Your system hardware may be returned for a full refund in factory-sealed packing within 30 days; if returned in non-factory sealed packaging, you may be assessed a 20% restocking fee, reducing your system hardware purchase price refund. This restocking fee is not taxable.
If defective, your system hardware may be exchanged within 30 days of purchase; however, beyond 30 days the exchange of defective units will follow the manufacturer's warranty. You may request a return shipping label and refund by calling 844.NRG.SHOP. Please allow 10 business days for us to process your return and ship your exchanged item.
Home Automation Product Upgrades and Subscription Fees
If you choose to add a door lock, garage door opener, or image sensor to your Home Automation subscription, you understand that by purchasing the upgraded hardware you agree to the subscription service associated with that upgraded hardware, called "Automate." If you choose to add any video camera to your current Home Automation subscription, you understand that by purchasing the upgraded hardware you agree to the subscription service associated with that upgraded hardware, called "View."
You may call customer service to cancel the subscription upgrade at any time.
Payment
Payments are processed by Stripe, Inc. Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card and American Express are all accepted. Please be aware when using a bank debit card that funds may show as pending for 7-14 days.
Declined payments: If your card is declined, you will receive an error message. Your card will not be charged, and no order will be processed. There may be a pending transaction on your account until your card-issuing bank removes the authorization. This usually happens within 2-5 business days. Your card may be declined for the following reasons:

General decline – This is usually caused by insufficient funds or a credit-limit issue. Contact your card-issuing bank for further details.
Address Verification System (AVS) mismatch – The billing address you entered during checkout does not match the mailing address associated with your credit card billing statement.
Card code mismatch – The 3-4 digit CVV2/CVC2/CID code on the back of your credit card (or front for AMEX) does not match what was entered during checkout.

Although NRG believes that its expectations are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct, and actual results may vary materially. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated above include, among others, general economic conditions, hazards customary in the power industry, weather conditions, competition in wholesale power markets, the volatility of energy and fuel prices, failure of customers to perform under contracts, changes in the wholesale power markets, changes in government regulation of markets and of environmental emissions, the condition of capital markets generally, our ability to access capital markets, unanticipated outages at our generation facilities, adverse results in current and future litigation, failure to identify or successfully implement acquisitions and repowerings, our ability to implement value-enhancing improvements to plant operations and companywide processes, our ability to obtain federal loan guarantees, the inability to maintain or create successful partnering relationships, our ability to operate our businesses efficiently including NRG Yield, our ability to obtain and retain retail customers, our ability to realize value through our commercial operations strategy and the creation of NRG Yield, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, the ability to realize anticipated benefits of our acquisitions (including expected cost savings and other synergies) or the risk that anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected, and share repurchase under the Capital Allocation Plan may be made from time to time subject to market conditions and other factors, including as permitted by United States securities laws. Furthermore, any common stock dividend is subject to available capital and market conditions.

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and NRG as a result of this agreement or use of the website. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including without limitation the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall remain in effect.

--Security and Smart Home Packages Offer Mobile App, Devices 
      and Monitoring Services for Connected Lifestyles--



      The smart home is more accessible than ever with the launch of Reliant’s 
      new suite of home security packages and automation tools. These 
      solutions help customers connect anywhere, anytime, to what is often 
      their largest investment – their home.
    

      Retail electricity customers can now sign up for a customizable security 
      package from Reliant, or enroll in a new electricity plan that offers a
home automation package. These new advances provide a broad 
      customer-focused platform for integrating emerging and future home 
      technology innovations.
    

      “We are passionate about powering people at home and on the go and with 
      these new security and home automation solutions, we can make life 
      easier and more comfortable for consumers,” said Elizabeth Killinger, 
      president of NRG Retail and Reliant. “Customers can conveniently and 
      remotely control devices in their home through a new app – all from the 
      comfort of their couch or from thousands of miles away.”
    

      The security solution offers 24/7 professional, live security 
      monitoring services, expert installation and remote access via mobile 
      devices and computers. Customers on the go can use the app to:
    

        Arm/disarm their security system;
      

        Open/close their garage door and know when it’s open or closed;
      

        Turn on/off their lights even when away from home;
      

        Unlock/lock their doors remotely to let family, friends, contractors 
        or others into their home; and
      

        Keep an eye on their home with video cameras that record based on 
        specific actions, such as when the alarm is triggered.
      

      In addition to the new security offering, customers who want home 
      automation can sign up for a select Reliant Free WeekendsSM 
      24 plan that includes an easy to install package with a smart 
      thermostat, smart plug and gateway device. Customers can then use the 
      mobile app to:
    

        Connect to devices via the gateway;
      

        Set schedules for appliances and lights using their smart plug; and
      

        Lower cooling and heating bills by setting a smart schedule for their 
        thermostat, which can reduce costs up to 10% annually according to a 
        Department of Energy study.
      

      Consumers can call 1.844.758.7674 for more information on products and
services.
