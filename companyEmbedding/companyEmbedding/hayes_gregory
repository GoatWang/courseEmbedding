He has an excellent positive attitude and a showcases natural ability to sell. He is very attuned to customer needs and always drives large, impactful conversations. He structures his daily activities better than I ever did and because of this is able to always put his best efforts towards his best opportunities.

See moreSee lessDuring the two years that Greg worked in my organization, he demonstrated a high level of market and product expertise in the K-12 sector.  He had come from a different industry, but took on the personal responsibility to accelerate his learning curve and to become productive in a very short time.   As with his educational pursuits, Greg was very proactive with his customers in the the identification of their needs and the value proposition that our company offered to address their issues.  Within a year of Greg's tenure, he was one of the "go to" people when I had special projects or needed help covering an open territory.  It was in this type of situation that Greg worked with the administrative staff in the Virgin Islands to develop one of the company's largest single transactions.  He closed a deal that was worth over $2.5M and followed it with other significant wins.  He was a true asset to the team, not only for his productivity, but also for his posititive attitude that lifted everyone up around him.

UTC Names Gregory J. Hayes As President And Chief Executive Officer

			
				November 24, 2014
			
			
		







Main Content
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 24, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX) today announced that Louis R. Chenevert has informed the Board of Directors of his retirement as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Gregory J. Hayes, UTC Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been elected President, Chief Executive Officer and a director. Edward A. Kangas, lead independent director, has been elected non-executive Chairman of the board.
Mr. Hayes, 54, is a 25-year veteran of UTC who has served for the last six years as the company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In addition to his other responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Hayes has directed communications and interactions between UTC's Board of Directors and the investor community.
"The appointment of Greg Hayes to succeed Louis Chenevert continues the excellent leadership UTC has enjoyed for the past half century.  The Board thanks Mr. Chenevert for his 22 years of service to UTC, his leadership over the last six years and for his many contributions and important transformational initiatives during his tenure," Mr. Kangas said. "Greg is highly regarded by the Board and by UTC employees, customers and shareowners. We are confident Greg will lead UTC to increasing profitability and shareowner returns."
"I am honored by the Board's selection and I am excited to be leading this terrific company," Mr. Hayes said. "Our focus will remain on creating innovative products and solutions for our global customers and delivering best-in-class returns for our shareowners, all supported by our highly skilled and talented workforce."
Mr. Kangas is the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Deloitte, Touche, Tohmatsu. He has been a member of the UTC Board since 2008 and has served as Chairman of the Audit Committee and as lead director. 
UTC today also reaffirmed its expectations of 2014 earnings per share of $6.75 to $6.85 and sales of about $65 billion.
United Technologies, based in Hartford, Connecticut, provides high technology products and services to the building and aerospace industries. For more information, visit our website at www.utc.com or follow us on Twitter: @UTC.

Profile
WHO WE ARE
Greg and his team oversee and coordinate the financial affairs for a select number of individuals, families, retirees, business owners, corporate executives and institutions. Our job is to help our clients lead the best life they can with the money they have, to free them from concern, and to properly preserve and build the wealth needed to enjoy life by making the best possible decisions during the course of a lifetime and over multiple generations.
Greg joined Merrill Lynch as a financial advisor 30 years ago in 1987 and our clients benefit from the collective wisdom of a team with a combined 84 years of experience.With offices in Princeton, NJ and Yardley, PA, we serve clients throughout the country, providing the intimacy and personal attention of a boutique, combined with the vast resources of one of the world's largest financial institutions.|
Greg has been consistently recognized by Barron's magazine as one of the nation's premier financial advisors ("America's Top 1200 Advisors 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017")* and has received similar recognition from the Financial Times ("2014 Top 400 Financial Advisors")**, one of the most highly respected business newspapers in the world.
WHO WE SERVE
Although we work with clients from all walks of life, our services are best suited for those with $1 million or more of investable assets. Many of our clients have come to us over these past 30 years for the following reasons:



Those nearing retirement or currently retired who would like to lead the best life they can and help ensure they do not outlive their assets.






Business owners and corporate executives who are seeking a competent advisor to help them oversee their financial affairs, protect their family and free up their time.






Those individuals who have recently or are about to experience a liquidity event, such as a sale of a business or property, an inheritance, a divorce, a sale of stock or options, etc.






Those who are not satisfied with their current advisor and feel they may benefit from a second opinion.






Those seeking financing.


Institutions and corporations seeking professional cash management or treasury services.




HOW WE DO IT
We begin with a confidential conversation to identify client goals and financial priorities, define investment objectives, and determine risk tolerance. In addition, a full "financial inventory" is taken with respect to assets, liabilities, income, expenses, taxes, savings capacity, etc. This leads to a personalized, detailed, written strategy that focuses on where you are today, where you are trying to get to "tomorrow", and what actions need to be taken to help you accomplish what's important to you in life.
The written plan will frequently include recommendations regarding the following:



Retirement Planning






College Planning






Survivor, Income & Asset Perservation






Wealth Transfer Planning






Cash Management






Tax Minimization






Asset Allocation






Investment Selection & Diversification


Financing & Liability Management



Once the plan is in place and the portfolio is properly structured, performance is monitored and reported on a regular basis, and a formal contact schedule is put in place to help ensure that a continual and effective communication flow is ongoing.
If this approach appeals to you, we welcome the opportunity to meet with you to learn more about each other and talk it through further.

Clients should review any planned financial transactions or arrangements that may have tax, accounting or legal implications with their personal professional advisors. Asset Allocation does not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
I follow the deep-seated Merrill Lynch tradition of participating in the communities we serve. This drives my interest in spending time volunteering with organizations in our community.

At Merrill Lynch, your financial advisor focuses on the things you care about most- family, goals and priorities - even as they change over the years.



Understanding Your Life


WelcomePhilosophyApproachCapabilities




Welcome
My mission, first and foremost, is to understand your goals and priorities. To take the time to ask hard, smart questions and listen carefully, then understand in great detail, exactly where your wealth stands today and where you'd like it to be tomorrow. I then help you design, implement and periodically monitor a customized wealth management strategy that helps you and your family pursue personal financial goals without unnecessary investment risk. My approach is about designing strategies that help turn goals into reality. When you succeed, I succeed.




Philosophy 
I believe that the best financial strategy is the one that helps you pursue your goals. That's why, from the start, I talk about your aspirations and encourage you to ask questions about issues that matter most to you. Worried about managing future health care expenses? College on the horizon? Considering the sale of a business or purchase of a home? Preparing to pass your wealth on to future generations? With access to the investing insights of Merrill Lynch and the banking convenience of Bank of America, I will work with you to develop strategies that are designed to address your priorities and financial needs.




Approach
I begin every relationship with a conversation, helping you to identify and prioritize which goals matter most to you. Whether that's transferring wealth to the next generation, customizing financial strategies that help you pursue your passions, or simply providing advice and guidance to help you stay informed, I start by listening to learn more about you. Merrill Lynch developed the Investment Personality Assessment to help us get to know your investing preferences. By gaining a deeper understanding of how you think and feel about investing through this assessment, I can help customize the financial strategy we develop together.




Capabilities
You can’t feel good about your finances unless you know exactly where you are, where you’re going, and how much you’re paying to get there. I work with you to develop a customized financial strategy, drawing on the best thinking of our firm, to help you with your financial future. I will manage all aspects of your relationship, making it clear what you’re paying for and what you’re getting. As your life and the markets change, we will meet regularly to help make sure you’re on track to achieve your goals and to adjust your strategy as needed for the journey ahead.










Your Financial Strategy
Drawing from our experience, the investment insights of Merrill Lynch and access to the banking convenience of Bank of America, we will develop a strategy, built around the priorities most important to you. We will strive to help you stay on track, regardless of what the markets are doing.

We understand that both your life and the financial markets can change over time. By regularly checking-in to discuss changes in your life and revisiting your financial strategy, our goal is to help give you peace of mind* that you're on track to help achieve what's most important to you.





Regular reviews to help you stay on track
We'll meet with you regularly to review your goals and the progress you’ve made toward reaching them. We'll also discuss any adjustments needed to your financial strategy to help you stay on course.

Access to what you need, when you need it
MyMerrill is your destination for access to your financial information, secure communications, and a robust offering of tools and capabilities.

Your advisor is never more than a click away within our site or mobile apps
Have peace of mind with our customizable security capabilities such as touch id, one time passcode, and other security features
Access to your complete financial life is available with My Financial Picture, Merrill Lynch’s asset aggregation tool




*Peace of mind is an aspirational state of mind that clients hope to achieve. There are no guaranteed results following completion of the Goals-Based Wealth Management process because markets can fluctuate and investments can lose value. Advisors work with clients to help them understand how the goals based wealth management process can help to address their concerns, financial situation and priorities.







Let’s Have a Conversation
Helping you reach your goals starts with getting to know you personally. Through understanding what matters most to you, I can help you create a financial strategy that reflects your personality. Only then can I offer an approach that is built around your life priorities and the ongoing advice you need to help you manage fluctuations in the market and changes in your life. Let’s work together to help you achieve your goals.

I was sorry to hear of Hayes death.  I am a cousin and even though I did not know Hayes that well I have fond memories of going to Rabbit Creek in Macon County to visit Uncle Parker and Aunt Lee.  They were both so very proud of their children and would always keep us informed about where they were and what they were doing, taking off the mantle the picture of each as they told us about them.    Again, please accept our condolences.

I was sorry to hear of Hayes death.  I am a cousin and even though I did not know Hayes that well I have fond memories of going to Rabbit Creek in Macon County to visit Uncle Parker and Aunt Lee.  They were both so very proud of their children and would always keep us informed about where they were and what they were doing, taking off the mantle the picture of each as they told us about them.    Again, please accept our condolences.
