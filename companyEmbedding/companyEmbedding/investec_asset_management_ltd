Our story







                        History
                    
From start-up to global business



It all began in South Africa in 1991. We were a small start-up offering domestic strategies in an emerging market. Now we’re an international business managing approximately $124 billion* for clients based all over the world.
*As at 30.06.17













                        Perspective
                    
Unique journey: unique insight



We are on a truly unique journey. Launched in South Africa in 1991, we are one of the first asset management firms to build a global franchise from emerging market origins. This means we see the world differently, allowing our clients to benefit from our unique insight.













                        People
                    
More than a job



We are curious for our clients. We put our clients and our people at the centre of our business. This is after all their business. Our people enjoy working without constraints and they’re passionate about what they do. That’s why so many of our senior people have been with us for so long.

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]
Products and divisional structure[edit]
Investec is organised as a network comprising six business divisions: Asset Management, Wealth & Investment, Property, Private Banking, Investment Banking and Capital Markets.[7]
Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]
ProMaths[edit]
Since 2005 Investec has been sponsoring a flagship project started by the Kutlwanong Centre for Math, Science and Technology. The project aims at improving the mathematics and science skills of students from historically disadvantaged regions across South Africa. The project has been a huge success year on year, with most of the students obtaining distinctions in mathematics and science, and their other subjects. In 2014 the project was awarded the Mail & Guardian Investing In The Future STEM award.[35]
Other[edit]
Other sponsorships include the Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute in London's Hyde Park[36] and Russian Tennis Player Elena Dementieva for the 2008 Wimbledon tournament as well as the Australian Open in January 2009.[37]

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]




Investec Loyal about to win the 2011 Sydney to Hobart, taken from Sandy Bay, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia


In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB. As a result, Investec now employs more than 240 specialists in Ireland.[16]
Operations[edit]
Investec employs approximately 8,200 people worldwide and operates primarily in South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland. It also has banking operations in Switzerland, Mauritius, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Jersey, Namibia, Botswana, Canada, Taiwan and the United States.[7]
Products and divisional structure[edit]
Investec is organised as a network comprising six business divisions: Asset Management, Wealth & Investment, Property, Private Banking, Investment Banking and Capital Markets.[7]
Legal structure[edit]




LTI TX4 "Silver" advertising for Investec


In July 2002, Investec became the first South African company to list on both the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, by implementing a dual listed companies (DLC) structure.[17]
The main features of the DLC structure are:

Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate legal entities and listings, but are bound together by contractual agreements and mechanisms.[17]
Investec plc is the holding company for the majority of the group's non-Southern African operations and Investec Limited is the holding company for the majority of the group's Southern African operations.[17]
Investec operates as if it is a single unified economic enterprise.[17]
Shareholders have common economic and voting interests as if Investec plc and Investec Limited were a single company.[17]
Creditors, however, are ring-fenced to either Investec plc or Investec Limited as there are no cross guarantees between the companies.[17]

Empowerment in South Africa[edit]
Investec's approach to transformation within South Africa involves:

Fostering the creation of new black entrepreneurial platforms[18]
Serving as a source of empowerment financing[18]
Encouraging internal transformation by bringing about greater representivity in the workplace. Investec focuses on creating black entrepreneurs within its organisation[18]

Sponsorships[edit]
Cricket[edit]
Investec announced a ten-year title sponsorship of Investec Test Match cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board on 24 November 2011 at Lord's Cricket Ground. This sponsorship, will run until 2021 and is the longest sponsorship agreement secured in ECB’s history.[19]
Rugby[edit]
Investec is involved in a number of rugby sponsorships around the world, as they feel that "rugby embodies Investec's beliefs in collaborative teamwork, innovative play and determination and it’s for these reasons that we support many rugby initiatives".[20]
Investec previously sponsored the Investec Internationals Series (formerly the Investec Challenge) played at Twickenham Stadium, England.[21]
Investec is in the third year as the sponsor of the Investec Super Rugby competition in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.[22][23]
Investec also supports the International Rugby Academy South Africa which aims to capitalise on an untapped demand for high performance in playing and coaching rugby in South Africa.[24][25]
In 2010 Investec announced that they are the official sponsors of the Tri Nations rugby competition in New Zealand for the second year running.[26][27]
Horse racing[edit]
Investec has become a long term sponsor of the Epsom Derby festival in the UK until 2013. The illustrious horse-racing event is now known as the Investec Derby.[28][29]
Investec also sponsors the Investec Cape Derby in South Africa.[30]
Football[edit]
Investec has become the official shirt sponsor for Tottenham Hotspur's domestic cup games and UEFA Champions League games for the 2010/2011 and UEFA Europa League games for the 2011/2012 seasons. This sponsorship marked the first promotion into the football world for Investec.[31][32][33] In 2014, Investec became the official shirt sponsor for Widnes F.C. in the North West Counties Football League Division One.[34]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]

In 2005, Investec sold its UK Private Client Stockbroking operation, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite Limited to Rensburg plc. Investec retains a 47.7% interest in the combined entity, Rensburg Sheppards plc.[12] In 2007, Investec plc acquired Kensington Group plc[13] and Experien (Pty) Ltd.[14] Investec plc acquired the remaining shares in Rensburg Sheppards plc in 2010. This business has since been rebranded as Investec Wealth & Investments and incorporates other wealth activities previously operated through the Bank.[15] In June 2012, Investec plc completed the €32 million acquisition of Irish brokerage firm, NCB.

Investec was founded as a small leasing and financing company in 1974 in Johannesburg by Larry Nestadt, Errol Grolman and Ian Kantor. It has expanded through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.[7] It secured a banking licence in 1980[8][9] and was first listed on the JSE Securities Exchange in South Africa in 1986, after merging with Metboard, a trust company. In 1988, Investec Bank Limited was restructured into Investec Group Limited ("IGL"), giving Investec Management and staff control of the company.[8]
In 1990, Investec acquired property management company I. Kuper & Company (Pty) Limited, Corporate Merchant Bank Limited (formerly Hill Samuel Merchant Bank Limited) and trade finance company Reichmans Limited.[8] Investec entered the UK market in 1992, by acquiring London-based Allied Trust Bank Limited ('ATB'), this was the first international acquisition by the Group.[8] In 1998, Investec acquired Guinness Mahon, a leading London based merchant bank, and Henderson Crosthwaite, its stockbroking arm, for £95m.[10] It also bought Hambros plc, another London based merchant bank the same year.[11] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2002.[8] In 2003 in a Black Economic Empowerment transaction empowerment partners acquired a 21.5% stake in the South Africa-listed Investec.[8]

Asset Management


























About Investec Asset Management
Investec Asset Management is a specialist provider of active investment products and services to institutional and individual investors. Established in South Africa in 1991, the firm has been built from  a small start-up into an international business.
 
Our range of investment capabilities is intentionally innovative. Roots in Africa have given us expertise in frontier markets and commodity investment, while our established presence in the United Kingdom provides us with a perfect vantage point for global investing. We build investment capabilities in areas where we have proven expertise, seamlessly integrating our investment management processes within a tight risk management framework.  We truly own each investment capability and continue to improve and develop them over the longer term.

Accessibility














We recognise that its important to provide a website that is accessible for all users. Accordingly, we have worked to ensure that our site can be easily used by people with disabilities.






























To ensure we are as accessible as possible we have made significant changes to achieve a Conformance Level "A" of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines on investec.com.  Most pages adhere to Conformance Level "A".

 Accessibility features
We have introduced the following features to ensure the best use of our site by all of our users.

 Headings and navigation menus
HTML heading tags are used to convey document structure. H1 tags are used for main titles, H2 tags for subtitles etc.
Navigation menus are marked up as HTML lists. This ensures that the number of links in the list is read out at the start and it can be skipped easily.

Images
All images used in this site include descriptive alt tag attributes. Where an image has no use other than being decorative the alt tag is set to null to allow easy reading of the site by all users.

Colours
We have taken care to ensure that the site's font and background colour combinations contrast significantly and are effective in ensuring information is still clear when viewed in different colour combinations.
If you wish to override the site's colours, you can do this by changing your browser settings to your own preference.

Font size
Most of the font sizes we use on our site are sizable. You can change the font size to make it either larger or smaller via your browser settings. You can change the font size in the following ways depending on your browser;


In Internet Explorer; select View, then Text Size, and then your preferred size.
In Netscape; select View, then Text Zoom, and then your preferred percentage size.

Stylesheets
This site uses cascading style sheets for all visual layout. If your browser or browsing device does not support stylesheets at all, the use of structured semantic mark up ensures that the content of each page is still readable and clearly structured.

Tables
Most data tables have properly scoped header cells, to allow screen readers to render them intelligently. We have also ensured table summaries are used as well as captions where appropriate.
Tables used for layout use none of the above attributes to ensure that they are not confused with data tables.

Forms and fields
All form fields follow a logical tab sequence to ensure easy navigation.
Most form fields also have ‘label’ and ‘id’ attributes to explicitly associate the form field with its label to allow for easy entry of data.

JavaScript
If you disable Javascript, you can still access the site’s content.

Links
All links have been written to make sense when taken out of context. Where appropriate, we have also added link title attributes to describe the link in greater detail.

Copy
Abbreviation and acronym tags have been used where appropriate to ensure abbreviations and acronyms are given a full textual explanation.
We have also ensured that blockquotes are only ever used for identifying quotations. They are not used for formatting purposes.

Useful links

If you would like to know more about accessibility and the Internet, you may be interested in the following websites:

Protecting yourself from fraud





















ShellShock / Bash vulnerability

You may be aware of media reports regarding a security bug called ShellShock or Bash which allows criminals to attack and compromise vulnerable systems.

Investec takes the protection of your information and our banking services seriously. We reassure you that none of our online systems are affected by this vulnerability and that we continually monitor the security of our sites and take ongoing action to protect them.

If you have any queries, please contact your Private Banker or email [email protected]








































Helping you to stay safe online

Advice on how to keep your identity, computer and money safe while using the Internet











What should I do if I've fallen victim to fraud on my Investec accounts?

Contact us immediately if you think you are or may be a victim of fraud on your Investment Account, Investec card or Bank account.

We take online security very seriously
We place the highest priority on your online security; however you need to take some basic precautions when using the Internet and banking online, to protect your identity, your information and your finances.















What we are doing to protect you








We place the highest priority on the confidentiality and security of your financial information and transactions and are constantly reviewing our infrastructure and security measures, such as firewalls and encryption technology to ensure they’re up to date and meet our stringent security requirements.
We invest significant resources in maintaining the security of Investec Online Banking, some of them are detailed below:
Data encryption
Our Online Banking service is hosted on a secure, 128-bit encrypted server. This means that any information you send us is encoded for your protection.

Timed log out
Online Banking logs you out if you don't use the service for 10 minutes. This gives you added protection if you forget to log yourself out.

Deactivation of your login details
We'll automatically disable your access to Online Banking if three incorrect attempts are made to log in using your details. This is to stop fraudsters making repeated attempts to get into your accounts.

Shopping on line
Verified by Visa, which we provide in association with Visa, protects your cards against unauthorised use when you shop online at participating retailers. When you buy something in a shop using a Investec Card, you validate the transaction by entering your PIN or signing a receipt. Verified by Visa mimics this process online by providing a digital receipt that you authorise using a password.

Travelling abroad
If you're planning to travel, it's best to let us know in advance. This helps avoid problems with using your cards and accounts overseas, as well as helping to protect you from fraud while you're away.

'Traffic lights' - extended validation certificates
If you use one of the more recent Internet Browsers, when you log in to our online banking service, the address bar (which starts with 'https://') will turn green. It's an extra way of helping you check that a website is safe, secure and trustworthy.


















What you need to do to protect yourself








To stay secure, please read the following recommendations for best practice online security options:

Install a personal firewall product
Hackers can infect home computers by connecting to your computer while you’re surfing the internet. The best way to protect your computer from unauthorised connections from the internet is to install a personal firewall. There are several options on the market, some of which are free.

McAfee

Symantec

Zone Labs

The firewall sits between your computer and the internet and acts as a security guard, restricting what can enter and leave your computer.

At first, the firewall may ask you what you want to allow in or out of your computer. However, it soon learns to make these decisions independently, based on the decisions you make early on. The most important point is never to allow anyone else to connect to your computer.
Regularly use an antivirus product, and keep it updated
These products can also scan for spyware and adware.
The most common way to receive a virus is through an attachment to an email. Attachments may appear to be word documents, spreadsheets or pictures but often contain malicious viruses. If you use email at home, you should use an anti-virus product to protect yourself and never open an attachment that has not come from a trusted source.
There are many anti-virus products and some are available for home users free of charge:

AVG
Kaspersky
McAfee
Symantec
Zone Alarm

With any anti-virus product, it’s important to keep it up to date, so to protect against new viruses that are released. Most commercial products (such as McAfee, Kaspersky and Symantec) have a mechanism to update themselves automatically. The free products typically need to be updated manually.
The anti-virus product should also be scheduled to scan your computer regularly in order to detect and clean out any viruses.
Do not open unsolicited emails with attachments
These may contain a virus. Also, if you receive an unwanted email saying "reply to unsubscribe", ignore it. Senders can use this to confirm your email address is valid - and are then likely to send you more emails.
Review your “Sent items” folder
If it contains messages that have been sent without your knowledge, your computer may have a virus or may have been compromised
Update your operating system (Windows, Mac) and browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari)
Make sure your computer software has all the necessary security updates available from the vendor. It’s best to ensure this is done automatically.
Ensure no one has unauthorised access to your computer.
Destroy or delete anything containing login details or security information
Even if we sent it to you.
Never email, write down or tell someone your security information or logon details.
The only time you will ever need to enter your Investec Online Banking user ID, password and secret is when you log on to Investec Online Banking at investec.com.
Do not save login details or passwords on your computer
Disable, refuse or decline any on-screen prompt on your computer which asks if you wish the computer to remember any of your security information or logon details.
Avoid reusing the same security information
You should create and use different passwords for each service provided by us, another member of Investec Group or another service provider.
Don’t leave a computer unattended while logged on to Investec Online Banking
Change your passwords regularly
Avoid familiar names, numbers and places (such as birthdays and phone numbers).
Be aware of ‘shoulder-surfers’.
Shoulder surfing refers to people who use direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder to get information. Shoulder surfing is particularly effective in crowded places because it’s relatively easy to watch someone as they fill out a form or enter their PIN or passwords at a cash machine or while using online banking.
Protect your printed or physical information just as you would protect your valuables.
This includes statements from financial institutions, shops and utility bills. Shred or destroy any personal documents you don’t need to keep.
Always log off from Investec Online Banking
It’s important to always end your session by clicking on the Log off menu item before closing the browser. Investec Online Banking does have an automatic timeout feature for security purposes, but we always recommend you end your Investec Online Banking session once you’ve completed your online banking activities.


































Protect yourself from fraud
There are numerous scams that fraudsters are using to steal from you or trick you into paying money or sharing personal information.















Identity theft and Social engineering








Social engineering
Social engineering is the act of manipulating people into doing what you want. In terms of online fraud, a fraudster will usually trick people into disclosing their passwords, log-in details or other confidential information.
You can protect yourself by:

Not disclosing confidential information over the phone unless you're absolutely sure of the caller's identity. If in doubt, ask for the caller's phone number and check it to see that it's genuine.

Never sending confidential information by email. It can easily be intercepted by a third party, and companies like ours will never ask you to email personal details, account information or passwords.

Keeping your PIN confidential at all times. Banks, including us, will never ask you to disclose your PIN.












Identity theft
Your identity is a valuable commodity, however over 100,000 people fall victim to identity theft each year.
Identity theft is when a fraudster steals your personal or financial details, which criminals then use to impersonate you, open bank accounts, obtain credit or set up businesses.
Once your details are stolen, you could become a victim of identity fraud.
Be suspicious if you notice any of the following:

Bills, invoices or receipts addressed to you - for goods or services you haven't ordered

Letters from solicitors or debt collection agencies regarding debts that aren't yours

Letters or statements for bank accounts you did not open

Transactions appearing on your bank statements (normally withdrawals) that you don't recognise

New accounts showing up on your credit report

Documents like your passport, driving licence, utility bills or bank statements have gone missing

If you’ve been a victim of identity fraud you should act quickly – don’t ignore the problem. Even though you didn’t order those goods or open that bank account, the bad debts will end up under your name and address.
Contact us immediately if you think you are or may be a victim of fraud on your Investment account, Investec card or Bank account or you suspect that somebody has accessed your on line account.
If you think you’re a victim of this kind of identity fraud, you should report the matter to the relevant organisation. Depending on their advice, you should then alert your local police force. You should report all lost or stolen documents – such as passports, driving licences, plastic cards, cheque books – to the relevant organisation.
You can learn more about identity theft at the UK Police’s Action Fraud website

















Advance fee frauds








Advance fee frauds or Nigerian 419 scams
Advance Fee Frauds or Nigerian 419 scam (the name comes from section 419 of the Nigerian criminal code) combine the threat of impersonation fraud with a variation of an advance fee scheme in which a letter or email offers the recipient the “opportunity” to share in a percentage of millions of dollars that the author is trying to transfer illegally out of a developing country.  The scheme relies on convincing a willing victim, to send money to the author in several instalments of increasing amounts for a variety of reasons.
Payment of taxes, bribes to government officials, and legal fees are often described in great detail with the promise that all expenses will be reimbursed as soon as the funds are spirited out of the country. In fact, the millions of dollars do not exist, and the victim eventually ends up with nothing but loss. 
If you receive a letter or email from anybody asking you to send personal or banking information, do not reply; simply delete the letter or email.
Remember the golden rule: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

















Online Frauds








Phishing
Phishing (pronounced fishing) is a process used by fraudsters in an attempt to acquire your confidential information by sending out emails or other kinds of messages that direct you to bogus websites or phone lines. They believe that if they send out enough emails somebody will respond (or “bite”) and provide personal or financial information.
These emails or messages claim to be from a particular company, so they often look legitimate. But these messages are actually sent by fraudsters, often at random. Any information you disclose on these bogus websites or phone lines is captured by the fraudsters.
You can protect yourself by treating any unsolicited emails or calls that ask for confidential information with suspicion. If in doubt about the validity of a particular message, contact the company that supposedly sent you the message to make sure it’s genuine.

To learn more about phishing, visit the UK banking industry’s website Bank Safe Online.
If you have received a fraudulent or suspicious email, which you have not responded to please forward the e-mail to [email protected]
If you have responded to a phishing email please Contact us as soon as possible to help us protect you and your finances.
Please note, we may send you emails from time to time. However, we will never send you an email asking for your security information or logon details, or direct you to a web page that asks for this information. We will also never send you an email with a link to Investec Online Banking.











Computer Malware
Malware is the collective term for any malicious software that might infect a computer, including Trojans, viruses and spyware. The development and spread of malware is becoming increasingly sophisticated and is driven by organised criminals for financial gain.
Trojans
A trojan is a type of malware that is capable of stealing information, recording your passwords and other personal details by capturing your keystrokes or taking screen shots of sites you visit. These details are then sent to the fraudsters to help them steal your money.
Trojans can be installed from infected websites or storage devices connected to the computer and you may not even know that you are infected.

The best way to protect yourself from trojans is to install firewalls and internet security software on your computer and to keep these things up-to-date.
Computer Viruses
Viruses are designed to replicate and multiply, spreading between computers. They can cause severe problems, sending out spam email, slowing down or crashing your computer, corrupting or deleting files, and sending confidential information to fraudsters. Viruses may even redirect your internet browser to spoof websites.
The most effective protection is to keep your computer’s security up-to-date and anti-virus up-to-date.
Spyware
Spyware is designed to invade your privacy, gathering information about your computer and internet activity. Spyware can also be responsible for irritating pop-up adverts, slowing down your computer, and sending confidential information to fraudsters.
Spyware can be installed from infected websites or storage devices connected to the computer and you may not even know that you are infected.
The most effective protection is to keep your computer’s security up-to-date. Many anti-virus packages now come with built-in protection against spyware, so make sure you always have the latest version.
Money mules
Most bank accounts do not allow customers to make online cross-border transfers. Since most online fraudsters tend to be based outside the UK or SA, they need people to help launder the funds they receive from their scams. These people are called money mules and they are often innocent victims themselves.
Money mules receive funds into their accounts that fraudsters have stolen. These funds generally come from other victims whose bank accounts UK have been compromised. The money mules are then encouraged to send the funds to the fraudsters overseas using a wire-transfer service, minus their commission.
Money mules are recruited through a variety of methods, including spam emails, genuine job search websites, email responses to a victim's online CV, instant messaging and newspaper ads.
This scam offers you the chance to earn some easy money for a few hours' work each week, but beware: Handling money that's been obtained fraudulently is a crime, even if you're not knowingly complicit in the crime.
You can protect yourself from becoming involved by:

Treating any unsolicited job offers with suspicion, especially if the company is based overseas.

Verifying the details of any company that you’re considering working for.

Not giving your bank account details to anyone whom you don't know and trust.

Assisting a criminal transfer of monies to another account could make you subject to criminal investigation, which may lead to your prosecution
Remember the golden rule: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Card Fraud








                    Lost and stolen card fraud
                    Counterfeit card fraud or skimming
                    A counterfeit card can be a fake card or a valid one        that’s been altered or recoded.

        Most cases involve skimming, when the data on your card’s magnetic strip        is electronically copied on to another card without your knowledge.

Skimming commonly occurs at retail outlets – particularly bars,        restaurants and petrol stations – and at cash machines that have been        illegally fitted with a skimming device. The stolen data is then used to        create counterfeit cards.

Most people are unaware that they’ve fallen victim to this fraud until        their statements arrive.
 To protect yourself:

                    Don’t leave your card with bar or restaurant staff        for long periods
Don’t let retail staff take your card away to process        payments
Check cash machines for signs of tampering before you        use them

                    Card-not-present fraud
                    This is the most common type of card fraud. It occurs        when fraudsters steal your card details and use them to buy things over        the internet or by phone, fax or mail. Always be aware of who you are        dealing with.
To protect yourself:


                    Avoid entering your card details on shared or         public computers
Always remember to log out of any websites         where you’ve entered your card details
Only enter your card details on secure sites         (ie, those whose web address begins with ‘https’ and have a padlock in         the browser window)
Keep a close eye on your statements and report         any fraudulent transactions immediately

                    What should I       do if I've fallen victim to card fraud
Contact us immediately if you think you are or may be a victim of fraud on your Investment Account, Investec card or Bank account.

















ATM Frauds








In 2013, there has been an increase in ATM card swapping and jamming:
Card swapping usually happens when a fraudster claims that the ATM is faulty and offers a client assistance. He/she will then swop the client’s card and use it at another ATM to withdraw funds. 

With card jamming, an ATM is tampered with and will hold a client’s card in the card reader. The fraudster will then collect the card and attempt to withdraw funds from the account at a later stage.

 Tips to keep safe at ATMs:

Contact us immediately report any suspicious activity to them.  

If anyone offers to assist you at an ATM or is lurking around the area, rather go to another ATM.

Keep your PIN safe at all times. Don't write your PIN down or save it on a device, rather memorise it.  

Make sure you are using the correct card at the ATM and make sure you get the correct card back when you are done.

Be aware of any skimming devices and mini cameras attached to the ATM and look out for any sign of tampering with the card reader slot.

If you receive an SMS notification for a transaction that you are unaware of, please contact the Investec Client Support Centre immediately.

If the ATM keeps your card or it is lost or stolen, please contact the Client Support Centre immediately to cancel the card.


















Courier or Police Scams








Typically a courier card scam involves customers being tricked into handing over their bank cards and PINs to fraudsters.

The scam starts with an unexpected phone call from someone claiming to be from the bank's fraud department, the police, or National Fraud Authority.

The caller will claim to have identified fraudulent transactions on your account and that your card has been compromised.

To gain your trust they may ask you to verify the call by phoning the telephone number printed on the back of your card, or give you another number to call.

This technique holds your phone line open, so that when you try to dial out, they can intercept and re-answer the call, claiming to be the Bank or Law Enforcement.

The fraudster will advise that your bank card must be collected to protect your card and assist an investigation. Usually they ask you to put your card into an envelope for a courier to collect and provide you with a fake reference number.

Now you'll be asked to enter your PIN into the phone, or put it into the envelope with the card.
A courier comes to your home and collects the card. With your card and PIN, they can now gain access to your account and carry out fraudulent transactions.

PLEASE NOTE: The bank may genuinely call you for fraud prevention purposes to verify whether a transaction is genuine. We will NEVER ask to collect your card, for your PIN number, card details or Online/Telephone banking log-in credentials.

















Cheque Fraud








How does cheque fraud occur?

Cheque fraud takes place when a fraudster uses a stolen or counterfeit cheque to pay for goods and services. More than 90% of fraudulent cheques are stopped before any loss occurs. But even so, cheque fraud still costs millions of pounds a year.

These losses can be compounded when the fraud also involves an ‘overpayment’. This occurs when the fraudster – who is often part of an organised gang – targets the seller of a high-value item, such as a car, and offers to pay using a stolen or counterfeit cheque made out to more than the price of the goods. Once the cheque clears, the victim is asked to transfer this ‘overpayment’ to a third party, as well as handing over the item to the fraudster.

When the real cheque owner discovers that money has been stolen from his or her account, the victim can be obliged to repay the total sum – even if this happens several weeks later.

How to protect yourself against cheque fraud


Don’t accept cheques from anyone unless you know and trust them, especially when a high-value cheque is involved.

Be aware that there’s a risk that money credited to your account from a cheque could be reclaimed if the cheque turns out to be stolen or counterfeit.

Always consider other ways of accepting payment for high-value items – a CHAPS payment (or guaranteed, same-day bank transfer) is ideal. Be especially wary if the buyer is unwilling to pay or split the relatively small cost involved with you.

Keep your chequebook in a safe place.

Report any missing cheques to your bank immediately.

Always check your bank statements thoroughly.

What should I do if I've fallen victim to cheque fraud

Contact us immediately if you think you are or may be a victim of fraud on your Investment Account, Investec card or Bank account.

















Protect your email account from hacking and fraud








Protect your email account from hacking and fraud

Email is now critical to your day-to-day activities and is used for more than simply communicating with friends and colleagues. For example, you may use your email to:


Store receipts and statements

Store the registration information for purchased software

Assist with the recovery of password for websites such as iTunes and eBay

Store details about airline and hotel bookings, with passport and ID information

Receive confirmation of financial transactions


Your email account is now immensely valuable and needs to be protected from loss or theft by criminals, who use a variety of techniques to try and steal the password to access your account:

Guessing a simple passwords

Tricking you to enter your password into a fake site (this is called phishing)

Installing a virus on your computer to capture the password as you log in 
(this is increasingly common in public internet cafes and airport lounges)

To protect your email account from being stolen, you can take some simple steps:

Use a strong password
A dictionary word used for a password can be ‘brute forced’ in seconds. 
Ideally, make it a phrase (ILikeIceCream) and then add some numbers (19ILikeIceCream76)
This would be nearly impossible for the criminals to guess (and easier for you to remember).


Don’t trust unsolicited emails and don’t click on the links in unsolicited emails.
Criminals often send out emails that look like they came from your Bank, SARS or Professional Institutions (eg SAMA, SAICA, etc) with links to fake websites where they capture your passwords as you try to log in.

Investec will never ask you to enter your username or password via an email. If you do receive a with a link to log in, it is a fake and an attempt to defraud you.

If your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc) supports strong or two-factor authentication, make sure you use it. The following section provides details of how to do this.  

If you suspect that your email account has been compromised, change your password immediately (from a known and trusted PC). 

The following section gives you advice on enabling strong or two-factor passwords on your email accounts.




















Gmail

Google provide a service (similar to online banking) where they will send you an SMS with a unique PIN which you will then need to enter to access your account. This is the best way to protect your account details from being stolen.
Also ensure that you request Google to notify you by email and phone when any changes are made to your account. If you do, you will receive an email with information about any changes you have made to your account’s security settings.











                    How to set up two-step verification on Gmail











Sign into your Google Account settings page by clicking on your name or picture in the upper right corner of the screen and then click on ‘Account’.




















On the left tab, click on ‘Security’ and then ‘Edit’ under ‘2-Step verification’. 

You will then see a step-by-step guide to help you through the setup process.

Once you are done, you will be taken to the two-step verification settings page again. Be sure to review your settings and add backup phone numbers.

You are done! Next time you sign in, you will receive an SMS with a verification code.












Easy Gmail setup for Android users
If you only access your Google Account from Android devices, you can use a short walkthrough to set up the Google Authenticator application on your phone. With Google Authenticator, you can generate verification codes on your phone even if your phone is not connected to a network.

Sign into your Google Account settings page by clicking on your name or picture in the upper right corner of the screen and then click on ‘Account’.

On the left tab, click on ‘Security’ and then ‘Edit’ under ‘2-Step verification’. Then click on ‘Settings’.

Android users (4.0 or older) will see a screen with the option to install the Google Authenticator app.




















If you prefer to receive codes by SMS instead of using the Google Authenticator app, click on the link at the bottom of the screen that says ‘You can receive codes by text message (SMS) or voice instead’ and follow the instructions to complete the setup.

If you would like to use Google Authenticator, click ‘Send me the app’ to install the app on your phone and follow the instructions on your screen to complete the setup process.

You are done! Next time sign in, you will be prompted to enter a code you will receive from the Authenticator app.




















Yahoo checks not only the password when somebody attempts to log into your account, it also looks at the location and computer where the attempt is made. If it looks suspicious (such a device you have never used before), Yahoo! Mail can require more than just your password, but you must have enabled two-step authentication. 
If you have enabled two-step authentication, a second step is necessary to complete login. This can be a code sent to your mobile phone or answering security questions. You can also turn off the latter and require only mobile phone verification. 
The Yahoo! Mail account is then as secure as your password and access to your mobile. 
How to protect your account with two-step authentication
To add a second layer of authentication for suspicious login attempts (from a new country, for example) to your Yahoo! Mail account: 

Hover the mouse cursor over your name or icon in the top Yahoo! Mail navigation bar

Select ‘Account Info’ from the menu 

If prompted, type your Yahoo! Mail password under ‘Password’ 

Click on ‘Sign In’

Under ‘Sign-In and Security’, follow the ‘Set up your second sign-in verification’ link 

Under ‘Further Protect Your Account’ make sure ‘Check this box to turn on the second sign-in verification’ is checked

If you already have a mobile phone number associated with your account, click on ‘Use Current Phone’ to use it for two-step authentication or click on ‘Use New Phone’ to use a different phone number. 

Please note that the form on this page may not allow you to enter phone numbers in all the countries Yahoo! can actually deliver verification codes to. You can add those mobile numbers on your account (see below). 
If you have not yet set up a mobile phone number or chose ‘Use New Phone’

Enter your phone number under ‘Second Sign-In Verification Setup: Add Mobile Phone’ 

Click ‘Receive SMS’

Type the verification code received at the number under ‘Enter code’. The code is not case-sensitive

Click on ‘Verify Code’

To request SMS message verification under ‘Your second sign-in verification is turned on’, choose ‘Use only my mobile phone number for verification’. 

For a two-step authentication with a password and security question, you can choose ‘Use either my security question or mobile phone number for verification’. 

Two-step authentication will only apply when you are accessing through the website, not when you are using an App on your phone or PC. 
How to add a mobile number not recognised on the two-step verification form 
To set up a new mobile phone number for recovering access to Yahoo! Mail: 

Click your name or avatar in the top Yahoo! Mail navigation bar

Select ‘Account Info’ from the menu 

Follow the ‘Update password-reset info’ link under ‘Sign-In and Security’

Click ‘Add another under Mobile Numbers’

Enter your mobile phone number

Click the country code to pick a different one

Click on ‘Save’. 




















Hotmail

To enable two-step authentication, visit the https://account.live.com and then navigate to https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage. Here, you will see a link to set up two-step verification.
Please note: You cannot have other Microsoft accounts linked to the Microsoft account you are trying to enable two-step authentication for. If you do, you will be prompted to unlink the accounts.
There is a short wizard. All you really need to do is be contacted via one of the alternate methods you previously supplied, for example a second email address. Microsoft will send a code to that account with the message “We need one more way to make sure you’re you”. When you enter the code, it enables the two-step verification.
Use two-step authentication
Two-step authentication is used in two ways - a security code or an app password. Put simply, whenever you need to sign into anything with your Microsoft account credentials (username and password), try doing so normally. If it works, great. Otherwise, you could be prompted to enter a security code. If not, you will need an app password.
Security code
If you have signed into Windows 8 with a Microsoft account and trusted the PC, you would have seen the security code prompt: ‘Microsoft will send a text message to your mobile phone that contains this code’.


















                    You must then enter that code on the website or in Windows or wherever you are prompted.

















That is one form of two-step authentication - your Microsoft account credentials plus the security code. 
App password

You can now also create an app password for those apps or devices that do not work with the security code system. 
One example is Microsoft Outlook 2013. If you had previously configured Outlook for Hotmail or Outlook.com and then configured the underlying Microsoft account, the next time you use the application, you will be prompted to enter your credentials again. Your normal password will not work - you need an app password.


















You can generate an app password at the https://account.live.com, again from https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage. 
Just tap the link ‘Create a new app password’ under App Passwords. When you do, you’ll be provided with an app password that you can type (or copy and paste) into the application.


















This also works from mobile browsers like the one on Windows Phone. This is handy because you may run into this issue with mobile apps as well. You can then use the phone’s copy and paste capability to get the app password into the mobile app that’s not authenticating properly against your Microsoft account.
Authenticator mobile app
When you need to generate a security code but have no cellular coverage, for example when you are flying, Microsoft provides a mobile app called Authenticator that can generate these codes in offline mode.
You need to configure the Authenticator app to work with your Microsoft account. Visit https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage on https://account.live.com. 
But this time, click the ‘Set up’ link under Authenticator app. In the next screen, you will be prompted to pair your phone with your Microsoft account using a bar code tag.


















In the Authenticator app on Windows Phone, tap the Add (+) app bar button to add your account.


















Then, tap the ‘Scan’ button that resembles a camera icon to scan the bar code. The app will quickly scan the bar code and then generate a code that you can type into the web page. Then, click the ‘Pair’ button to complete the process.
Going forward, the app will generate a new code automatically every 30 seconds. If you ever need to use a code to sign into your Microsoft account and your phone is offline, you can use this app to get the code.
