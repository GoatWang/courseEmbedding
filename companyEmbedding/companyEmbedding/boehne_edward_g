The Changing Landscape of Banking
Presented by Edward G. Boehne, President
      Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
The 94th Annual Convention of the New Jersey 
                      Bankers Association 
                    Southampton, Bermuda 
      April 29, 1997
                    
Thank you 
                      for inviting me to share some thoughts with you. I have 
                      attended these meetings off and on for more than 25 years. 
                      Over that time span there have been major changes in the 
                      banking landscape. 
New Jersey 
                      has often been in the forefront of changes in the banking 
                      industry. It was one of the first states to adopt statewide 
                      branching in 1972. And it was one of the first states to 
                      opt for interstate branching after the Riegle-Neal Act was 
                      passed in December 1994. 
 New Jersey 
                      has shared in the nationwide trend of bank consolidation. 
                      Since 1970, the number of banks in New Jersey has fallen 
                      two-thirds, but that doesn't mean the number of bank offices 
                      has fallen. In fact, the number of bank offices in New Jersey 
                      has increased 75 percent during the past 25 years. 
Consolidations 
                      have led to increased concentration of New Jersey's banking 
                      markets. The share of deposits held by the 10 largest banks 
                      more than doubled over the past 25 years, increasing from 
                      40 percent to nearly 85 percent today. New Jersey's banking 
                      market is much more concentrated than the nation's. 
Competition 
                      is also different today from what it was 25 years ago, both 
                      on the deposit side and the loan side. 
On the deposit side, 
                      money market mutual funds and stock and bond funds are competing 
                      aggressively with bank deposits. 
On the loan 
                      side, large corporations started to rely less on banks for 
                      short-term loans and more on the commercial paper market. 
                      Prime rate lending has never been the same. As time went 
                      on, nonbank firms began to compete for middle-market loan 
                      customers and even for small-business loans. In addition, 
                      banks now have a much larger share of their portfolios in 
                      real estate loans, largely because of the declining role 
                      of the savings and loan industry in the mortgage market. 
                      Banks also have engaged in more off-balance-sheet activities, 
                      particularly the securitization of assets. 
While financial 
                      innovations and new competition changed the banking industry, 
                      the regulatory structure also changed dramatically. First 
                      came the deregulation of deposit rates. Next came the deregulation 
                      of geographic restrictions, culminating this summer with 
                      nationwide interstate branching. And finally came greater 
                      deregulation of the asset side of banks' balance sheets. 
                      Most of this change, however, has come from revisions to 
                      bank regulations, not from new legislation. Congress is 
                      still considering whether to make major changes to banks' 
                      powers. 
The focus of the bank 
                      regulatory agencies has also changed over the years. The 
                      old banking system and regulatory structure were rooted 
                      in the technology and legislation of the 1930s, and the 
                      primary focus was safety. 
Market forces 
                      and new technology have broken down this old structure. 
                      Now the focus is on risk management. Of course, banks always 
                      were in the business of managing risk. What is different 
                      now is that the regulatory structure is acknowledging that 
                      risk isn't inherently bad, but risk does need to be managed 
                      and priced in a prudent manner. 
This shift in focus 
                      has contributed to further liberalization of the rules under 
                      which banks operate. Just recently, for instance, the Federal 
                      Reserve completed a comprehensive revision of Regulation 
                      Y, which should help banking organizations be more competitive 
                      with other financial service providers. The revisions streamline 
                      the applications process for both banking and nonbanking 
                      activities, remove tying restrictions on bank holding companies 
                      and their nonbank subsidiaries, ease requirements for the 
                      formation of bank holding companies, and eliminate or modify 
                      certain filing requirements under the Change in Bank Control 
                      Act. 
The shift 
                      in focus to the management of risk is also likely to bring 
                      further product deregulation in the future. As many of you 
                      probably know, I generally favor allowing banks to expand 
                      their powers in securities and many aspects of insurance, 
                      but have serious reservations about the broad mixing of 
                      commerce and banking. Any steps to mix commerce and banking 
                      should be small, until we gain more experience with the 
                      implications of mixing the two. 
An incremental 
                      approach is comparable with what was done with securities 
                      underwriting. We currently allow banks to affiliate with 
                      securities-underwriting firms provided that the holding 
                      company is well capitalized and that the securities affiliate 
                      derives only 25 percent of its revenue from corporate debt 
                      and equity issues. This revenue limitation was originally 
                      set at 5 percent, then raised to 10 percent, and late last 
                      year was upped to 25 percent as banks (and regulators) gained 
                      experience. This type of gradual approach should be applied 
                      to any further expansion of banking powers to nonfinancial 
                      activities. 
For banking 
                      to be healthy, we need a healthy economy. And, on this score, 
                      I think the near future is quite favorable. The national 
                      economy has been expanding steadily for over six years. 
                      The unemployment rate has fallen to low levels, and we have 
                      continued to experience relatively low inflation. This expansion, 
                      which is now beginning its seventh year, is the third longest 
                      of the post-World War II era and still going strong. 
But some 
                      of those pockets are in New Jersey; some parts of South 
                      Jersey, in particular, have stubbornly high unemployment. 
                      New Jersey has been growing more slowly than the nation 
                      throughout this expansion, and the pattern of growth has 
                      been uneven. Job levels are still not back to their pre-recession 
                      highs, and the state's unemployment rate has been higher 
                      than the nation's. Last year, however, New Jersey's job 
                      growth did pick up, which is good news. 
As I travel 
                      around the District, I hear more and more businesspeople 
                      say they are having difficulty finding qualified workers. 
                      Demand appears to be bumping up against available supply. 
                      This sentiment is shared by employers in many other parts 
                      of the nation and has raised concern at the policymaking 
                      level about the risks of an overheating economy. 
The ultimate 
                      goal of monetary policy is maximum sustainable growth, and 
                      keeping inflation low is important to achieving that goal. 
                      If we have learned anything in the past 25 years, it is 
                      that low inflation is a plus for sustainable growth and 
                      job creation. We cannot buy lasting prosperity by letting 
                      inflation creep up. A little upward creep becomes still 
                      more creep, and prosperity starts to erode. 
To avoid 
                      the undermining of growth, it is important to contain inflationary 
                      pressures before they take root  that is, prevention of 
                      accelerating inflation is less painful than curing it once 
                      it takes hold. Since it takes several quarters for monetary 
                      policy actions to have their full effect, policymakers must 
                      continuously weigh the risks of waiting too long to resist 
                      inflation versus acting too early or unnecessarily. There 
                      is a time for patience, as was the case for much of last 
                      year and the early part of this year, and there is a time 
                      for action. About a month ago the Fed took some preventive 
                      action and raised the federal funds rate slightly. 
Nonetheless, 
                      there are still some yellow, cautionary flags for banks 
                      at this stage of the economic expansion. Keep in mind that 
                      this is the point in the business cycle when we often get 
                      a deterioration in underwriting standards. The economy has 
                      been good for a long time, and it is easy to become complacent 
                      and think that the good times will last forever. 
Bankers, 
                      however, should resist this tendency. Don't plant the seeds 
                      of future loan problems. These days, people who have been 
                      in banking for five or 10 years have limited experience 
                      with the performance of loan portfolios during economic 
                      downturns. We have had only one recession during the past 
                      15 years. So unless some bankers study history, they may 
                      not appreciate what happens when the economy sours. Not 
                      that I expect a downturn in the economy this year or next 
                       I don't. But we haven't repealed the business cycle either, 
                      and the profitable loans of today can perform a lot differently 
                      under less favorable economic circumstances. 
What else 
                      is in store for the banking industry? We all expect to see 
                      fewer banks in the coming years as industry consolidation 
                      continues. But I believe we will still have a large number 
                      of community banks for many years to come. I do not expect 
                      to see only a handful of super-large banks in this country. 
                      In fact, interest in starting new banks continues to be 
                      high, although the rate at which new institutions have been 
                      opening has moderated. Over the past 10 years, over 1300 
                      new commercial banks have been chartered, 35 of these in 
                      New Jersey. At least one new bank opened in New Jersey earlier 
                      this year, and one or two others are currently in formation. 
Increasing 
                      technological change also looms in banking's future, as 
                      more electronic forms of banking become widespread. The 
                      Federal Reserve and other bank regulators are trying to 
                      avoid imposing regulatory constraints that might stifle 
                      innovations in the development of electronic forms of payment, 
                      such as stored-value cards. It is too early to know how 
                      electronic forms of money might evolve, and we do not want 
                      to inadvertently stand in the way of innovation.
Nonbank 
                      competition also will remain heavy in future years, even 
                      without new legislation that could further erode the barriers 
                      between types of financial institutions. Changes in technology 
                      and delivery systems are simply making it easier for all 
                      types of financial firms to compete on what has traditionally 
                      been banks' turf. 
I expect to see more 
                      attempts by nonbanks to become more directly involved in 
                      the payments system, which historically has been the sole 
                      province of the banking industry. For example, nonbanks 
                      now own a significant percentage of ATMs, from which depositors 
                      gain access to their bank accounts. And nonbanks play significant 
                      roles in providing electronic interfaces that consumers 
                      can use to initiate payments. For example, Intuit and Microsoft 
                      offer software for PC banking. Also, nonbank-sponsored credit 
                      cards are increasingly competitive with bank cards. 
With a changing 
                      environment, we in the Federal Reserve must also ask what 
                      changes we need to make. For instance, we are now putting 
                      more emphasis on risk management within our own organization. 
                      At the System level, we have combined discount window issues 
                      and payment-system-risk issues with other risk-management 
                      issues, placing all of them under the purview of one committee. 
                      Many Reserve Banks, including Philadelphia, are in the process 
                      of realigning their internal functions to match this System 
                      focus on risk management. 
The Federal 
                      Reserve has also consolidated some of its operations. We 
                      consolidated our computer operations several years ago  
                      from 12 sites to three. And we consolidated our savings 
                      bond operations into regional centers. We also established 
                      Product Offices, which coordinate some of the priced services 
                      as well as the cash and fiscal services offered by the Reserve 
                      Banks. Like you, we are searching for ways to achieve greater 
                      efficiencies. 
We are also 
                      asking whether the product lines we are in are the right 
                      ones for the future. To help answer that question, we have 
                      established a special, high-level committee to examine the 
                      Fed's role in the retail payments system. This group, headed 
                      by Vice Chair Alice Rivlin, will hold nationwide meetings 
                      to get industry and consumer feedback on some alternative 
                      scenarios depicting possible roles for the Fed in the retail 
                      payments system. 
At the other 
                      extreme, the Fed would become more heavily involved in retail 
                      payments services by quickly and deliberately moving the 
                      nation toward an electronic-based retail payments system. 
                      This other extreme would involve the Fed more deeply in 
                      facilitating the adoption of technologies and industry standards 
                      for electronic payments. The intent would be to make these 
                      electronic payment systems as universally accessible to 
                      all banks as the current paper-based system. The Rivlin 
                      Committee is also looking at two middle-ground scenarios 
                      that would have the Fed continuing to participate, as we 
                      do now, in providing retail payment services to varying 
                      degrees. 
This exercise 
                      of assessing the Fed's role in retail payments forces us 
                      all to reevaluate ways in which the Fed and other payments 
                      system participants interact. For example, were the Fed 
                      to liquidate its check-processing operations, obviously 
                      many banks around the country would have to turn to correspondent 
                      banks or clearing houses to process retail payments. At 
                      the other extreme, if the Fed became more involved in pushing 
                      the development of electronic retail payments, it might 
                      offer, for example, opportunities for banks to piggyback 
                      on the Fed's campaigns to enlist customers in direct-deposit 
                      programs and other uses of the ACH. Reevaluating the Fed's 
                      role is healthy, and our success will depend on the comments 
                      received from banks and others with an interest in an efficient, 
                      dependable, and accessible payments system. 
This fundamental 
                      look at the role of the Fed in the payments system is a 
                      topic you will be hearing more about in coming months. Several 
                      national forums will be held in various locations in May 
                      and June to hear from stakeholders, especially banks  
                      both large banks and community banks. In addition, each 
                      Reserve Bank will hold district meetings with bankers and 
                      other stakeholders to get their views. 
Since retail 
                      payments such as checks are fundamental to the business 
                      of banking, you should think carefully about what the Rivlin 
                      Committee is doing and what the implications might be for 
                      you and your customers. I urge you to offer your comments 
                      about whether the Fed should remain in the payments business 
                      or whether the Fed should get out. Even if you do not currently 
                      use Fed services, your views are important. For example, 
                      many community bankers, even those who do not use our payments 
                      services, have told me they think having the option to use 
                      the Fed for processing retail payments is valuable. I assure 
                      you that your comments will be heard. 
To conclude, the banking 
                      industry will continue to undergo fundamental changes in 
                      the coming years. We all need to adapt and try to make change 
                      an opportunity, not just a challenge. Whatever change might 
                      bring, however, our 
fundamental 
                      goals remain constant: a stable and healthy financial system; 
                      a noninflationary economic environment that supports the 
                      maximum sustainable growth of output and jobs; and a stable, 
                      efficient payments system accessible to banks of all sizes.
Each scenario 
                      explores what would happen to the future environment for 
                      financial services if the Fed took a particular role as 
                      a provider of payments services. At one extreme, the Federal 
                      Reserve would liquidate its retail payments operations and 
                      no longer provide retail payments services to banks  neither 
                      check services nor ACH. A second scenario involves privatizing 
                      the Fed's retail payments operations by spinning them off 
                      into what would become an independent entity. 
Increased 
                      competition in providing payments services could lead to 
                      greater efficiency in the industry and may yield benefits 
                      to consumers. But the expansion by nonbanks into some segments 
                      of the payments system also raises a number of issues. One 
                      is whether further expanding the involvement of nonbanks 
                      in the payments system can be done without also expanding 
                      the scope of the federal safety net. Related issues involve 
                      how the participation of nonbanks in the payments system 
                      might affect its stability, as well as its efficiency and 
                      accessibility. And a final issue is whether expanding access 
                      to nonbanks can occur while maintaining a level playing 
                      field with banks providing payments system services. All 
                      these issues will need closer examination as the barriers 
                      between banks and nonbanks continue to erode in the payments 
                      system. 
As time 
                      goes on, we will have to make additional judgments about 
                      where the risks lie. Preventive medicine isn't always popular, 
                      but it almost always pays off. In 1994, when interest rates 
                      were raised to avoid overheating, we were successful in 
                      prolonging the expansion and job creation through preemptive 
                      action. I think we have a good chance to do the same in 
                      1997. 
In the Philadelphia 
                      Fed's District, which includes much of New Jersey and Pennsylvania 
                      as well as all of Delaware, almost all segments of the economy 
                      are expanding, and people seem confident that expansion 
                      will continue through 1997 and 1998. The District's economy 
                      is generally operating at a high level, with only some pockets 
                      of weakness.
