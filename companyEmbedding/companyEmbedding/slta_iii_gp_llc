This Amendment No. 8 to Rule 13E-3 Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3, together with the exhibits thereto (the “Transaction Statement”) is being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Exchange Act”), jointly by the following persons (each, a “Filing Person,” and collectively, the “Filing Persons”): (i) Dell Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) and the issuer of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) that is subject to the Rule 13e-3 transaction, (ii) Denali Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), (iii) Denali Intermediate Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Intermediate”), (iv) Denali Acquiror Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Intermediate (“Merger Sub” and, together with Parent and Intermediate, the “Parent Parties”), (v) Silver Lake Partners III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (vi) Silver Lake Technology Associates III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (vii) SLTA III (GP), L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, (viii) Silver Lake Group, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, (ix) Silver Lake Partners IV, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (x) Silver Lake Technology Associates IV, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (xi) SLTA IV (GP), L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, (xii) Silver Lake Technology Investors III, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, (xiii) Mr. Michael S. Dell, an individual and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, (xiv) Susan Lieberman Dell Separate Property Trust (and, together with Mr. Dell, the “MD Investors”), (xv) MSDC Management, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and (xvi) MSDC Management (GP), LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. 
On February 5, 2013, the Company, Parent, Intermediate and Merger Sub entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Original Merger Agreement”). On August 2, 2013, the Company and the Parent Parties entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Original Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement Amendment”) amending the Original Merger Agreement. The Original Merger Agreement, as amended by the Merger Agreement Amendment, as may be further amended from time to time, is referred to as the “Merger Agreement” in this Transaction Statement. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intermediate. On May 31, 2013, the Company filed with the SEC a definitive proxy statement (the “Definitive Proxy Statement”). Concurrently with the filing of this Transaction Statement, the Company is filing with the SEC a supplement to the Definitive Proxy Statement (the “Proxy Statement Supplement” and, together with the Definitive Proxy Statement, the “Proxy Statement”) under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, relating to a special meeting of the stockholders of the Company at which the holders of the Common Stock will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of (i) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon and (ii) at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock held by stockholders other than the Parent Parties, Michael S. Dell and certain of his related family trusts, any other officers and directors of the Company and any other person having any equity interest in, or any right to acquire any equity interest in, Merger Sub or any person of which Merger Sub is a direct or indirect subsidiary that are voted for or against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement are conditions to the consummation of the Merger. A copy of the Definitive Proxy Statement is attached hereto as Exhibit (a)(2)(i)(A) and a copy of the Original Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the Definitive Proxy Statement. A copy of the Proxy Supplement is attached hereto as Exhibit (a)(2)(i)(B) and a copy of the Merger Agreement Amendment is attached as Annex A to the Proxy Supplement. 
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than certain excluded shares and shares held by any of the Company's stockholders who are entitled to and properly exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $13.75 in cash, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes, whereupon all such shares will be automatically canceled upon the conversion thereof and will cease to exist, and the holders of such shares will cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration. Shares of Common Stock held by any of the Parent Parties (including the shares held by Michael S. Dell and certain of his related family trusts, which shares will be contributed to Parent prior to the Merger) and by the Company or any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company will not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration. The Merger Agreement also provides for the payment of a special cash dividend of $0.13 per share to holders of record as of a date to be determined prior to the effective time of the Merger, conditioned upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders as described above and permits the Company to advance the record date for the quarterly cash dividend of $0.08 per share with a record date that would otherwise fall between September 26, 2013 and October 16, 2013 to ensure that such record date precedes the effective time of the Merger and enable the Company to comply with notice requirements under applicable law with respect to such record date. 
Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the effective time of the Merger by Parent and a holder of an option to purchase shares of Common Stock (each, a “Company Stock Option”), each Company Stock Option granted under the Company's stock plans other than the Dell Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”) and the Dell Inc. 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), whether vested or unvested and whether with an exercise price per share that is greater or less than or equal to $13.75, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of $13.75 over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, (as adjusted to reflect the $0.13 per share special cash dividend) less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable tax provisions. Parent has indicated to the Company that it intends to request, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, that the Company, before the completion of the Merger, commence a tender offer (the “option tender offer”) to purchase for cash, at prices to be determined by Parent, each tendered Company Stock Option granted under the 2002 Plan and the 2012 Plan, whether vested or unvested and whether with an exercise price per share (as adjusted to reflect the $0.13 per share special cash dividend) that is greater or less than or equal to $13.75, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the option tender offer, which conditions would include the consummation of the Merger, each such Company Stock Option that is validly tendered and not withdrawn by the holder thereof would be canceled in exchange for the applicable cash payment promptly after the completion of the Merger. Also in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Company Stock Options granted under the 2002 Plan and the 2012 Plan that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and not accepted for cancellation and payment in the option tender offer would be converted at the effective time of the Merger into options to purchase, on substantially the same terms and conditions (including vesting conditions) applicable to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, shares of Parent common stock. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Merger Agreement, Mr. Dell would not participate in the option tender offer and his Company Stock Options will be canceled for no consideration in connection with the Merger. 
Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the effective time of the Merger by Parent and a holder of an award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of Common Stock (each a “Company RSU Award”) with respect to any of such holder's Company RSU Awards, each Company RSU Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award multiplied by (ii) $13.75, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable tax provisions, subject to the recipient remaining in service until the vesting date applicable with respect to such awards. For purposes of unvested Company RSU Awards, any performance-based vesting condition will be treated as having been attained at the “target” level, and awards that are subject to performance-based vesting conditions will be deemed to vest ratably on the last day of each fiscal year during the portion of the performance period applicable to such awards that occurs following the effective time of the Merger. In addition, holders of Company RSU Awards will receive any additional amounts related to dividend equivalents credited with respect to such Company RSU Awards prior to the effective time, including the special cash dividend of $0.13 per share and the $0.08 per share regular quarterly dividend for the third quarter of the Company's current fiscal year (but which dividend equivalent payments remain subject to vesting of such Company RSU Awards). Notwithstanding the provisions of the Merger Agreement, Mr. Dell's unvested performance-based Company RSU Awards will be canceled and converted into a right to receive a cash amount as described above; however such cash amount will vest and pay out upon the Company RSU Awards' original vesting and payout dates. 
Except as otherwise agreed to in writing prior to the effective time of the Merger by Parent and a holder of any restricted shares of Common Stock (each a “Company Restricted Share”) with respect to any of such holder's Company Restricted Shares, each Company Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, will be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $13.75 less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable tax provisions. In addition, each holder of Company Restricted Shares will remain entitled to receive any additional amounts related to dividends payable on such Company Restricted Shares prior to the effective time, including the special cash dividend of $0.13 per share and the $0.08 per share regular quarterly dividend for the third quarter of the Company's current fiscal year (but which dividends payable remain subject to vesting of such Company Restricted Shares). Payment in respect of Company Restricted Shares (including associated amounts related to dividends) will be made on such date(s) as the Company Restricted Shares would have otherwise vested, but only if the holder of such Company Restricted Shares remains continuously employed with the surviving corporation through such vesting dates. 
As of August 5, 2013, Mr. Dell and certain of his related family trusts beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 274,434,319 shares of Common Stock (including (i) 1,101,948 shares subject to Company stock options exercisable within 60 days and (ii) 33,389 shares held in Mr. Dell's 401(k) plan), or approximately 15.6% of the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, and have agreed with Parent to contribute to Parent, immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, 273,299,383 shares in exchange for common stock of Parent.
