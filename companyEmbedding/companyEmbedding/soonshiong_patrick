Early life and education[edit]
Soon-Shiong was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Chinese immigrant parents who fled from China during the Japanese occupation in World War II.[6][7] His parents were originally from Toisan in Guangdong, China,[7] from among the Hakka people and language group.[6] He graduated from high school at age 16.[8][verification needed]
University and post-graduate training/medicine[edit]
Soon-Shiong studied on scholarship and graduated 4th out of his class of 189 from the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a combined Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh) medical degree at age 23.[8] He completed his medical internship at Johannesburg’s General Hospital.[when?][citation needed] He then studied at the University of British Columbia, where he earned a MSc degree, with research awards from the American College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Association of Academic Surgery (the first resident of the university to do so).[9][dead link] He moved to the United States and began surgical training at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon.[citation needed] Soon-Shiong is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Canada) and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons.[9][dead link][3]Soon-Shiong joined UCLA Medical School in 1983 and served on that faculty until 1991,[3][self-published source?] during which time he was a practicing transplant surgeon.[6] Between 1984 and 1987, he served as an associate investigator at the Center for Ulcer Research and Education.[3][self-published source?] Soon-Shiong performed the first whole-pancreas transplant done at UCLA,[when?][10][11] and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant,[when?] and the "first pig-to-[hu]man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients."[when?][10][better source needed] After a period in industry, he returned to UCLA in 2009,[citation needed] serving as a professor of microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics and bioengineering until this date.[when?][citation needed] Soon-Shiong served as a Visiting Professor at Imperial College, London in 2011.[12][dead link]
Entrepreneurial activities[edit]
In 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm. This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals (APP), of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to Fresenius SE for $4.6 billion in July 2008.[13][dead link] Soon-Shiong later founded Abraxis BioScience (maker of the drug Abraxane he co-discovered),[14] a company he sold to Celgene in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.[15](subscription required)
Soon-Shiong founded NantHealth in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information.[16] Soon-Shiong went on to found NantWorks in September 2011, which mission was "to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live."[17][18] In October, 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth’s supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds. The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.[19] In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, NantOmics, to develop cancer drugs based on protein kinase inhibitors. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks’ vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.[20]
In early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs.[21] He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.[22]
In 2010, with Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a "do-tank".[23][self-published source?] HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance.[2][24][dead link]In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service AccuRadio, investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster. [25]In July 2015, Soon-Shiong initiated an IPO for NantKwest (formerly ConkWest) that represented the highest value biotech IPO in history, at a market value of $2.6 billion.[26] In April 2016, the Los Angeles Times reported that Soon-Shiong received a pay package in 2015 from NantKwest worth almost $148 Million, making him one of the highest paid CEOs.[5] Soon-Shiong is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[27][28]

"The History of Pancreas Transplantation: Past, Present and Future". Acta Chir Belg. 108 (3, May-June): 367–378. PMID 18710120. The first attempt to cure type 1 diabetes by pancreas transplantation was done at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on December 17, 1966… [This] opened the door to a period, between the mid-[1970s] to mid-[1980s] where only segmental pancreatic grafts were used... In the late [1970s] – early [1980s], three major events… boosted the development of pancreas transplantation… [At] the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid-[1980s] and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas. During the modern era of immunosuppression, the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion became the gold standard… [for SPK, PAK, PTA]. CS1 maint: Uses authors parameter (link)

Early life and education[edit]
Soon-Shiong was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Chinese immigrant parents who fled from China during the Japanese occupation in World War II.[6][7] His parents were originally from Toisan in Guangdong, China,[7] from among the Hakka people and language group.[6] He graduated from high school at age 16.[8][verification needed]
University and post-graduate training/medicine[edit]
Soon-Shiong studied on scholarship and graduated 4th out of his class of 189 from the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a combined Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh) medical degree at age 23.[8] He completed his medical internship at Johannesburg’s General Hospital.[when?][citation needed] He then studied at the University of British Columbia, where he earned a MSc degree, with research awards from the American College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Association of Academic Surgery (the first resident of the university to do so).[9][dead link] He moved to the United States and began surgical training at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon.[citation needed] Soon-Shiong is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Canada) and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons.[9][dead link][3]Soon-Shiong joined UCLA Medical School in 1983 and served on that faculty until 1991,[3][self-published source?] during which time he was a practicing transplant surgeon.[6] Between 1984 and 1987, he served as an associate investigator at the Center for Ulcer Research and Education.[3][self-published source?] Soon-Shiong performed the first whole-pancreas transplant done at UCLA,[when?][10][11] and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant,[when?] and the "first pig-to-[hu]man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients."[when?][10][better source needed] After a period in industry, he returned to UCLA in 2009,[citation needed] serving as a professor of microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics and bioengineering until this date.[when?][citation needed] Soon-Shiong served as a Visiting Professor at Imperial College, London in 2011.[12][dead link]
Entrepreneurial activities[edit]
In 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm. This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals (APP), of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to Fresenius SE for $4.6 billion in July 2008.[13][dead link] Soon-Shiong later founded Abraxis BioScience (maker of the drug Abraxane he co-discovered),[14] a company he sold to Celgene in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.[15](subscription required)
Soon-Shiong founded NantHealth in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information.[16] Soon-Shiong went on to found NantWorks in September 2011, which mission was "to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live."[17][18] In October, 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth’s supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds. The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.[19] In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, NantOmics, to develop cancer drugs based on protein kinase inhibitors. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks’ vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.[20]
In early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs.[21] He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.[22]
In 2010, with Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a "do-tank".[23][self-published source?] HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance.[2][24][dead link]In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service AccuRadio, investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster. [25]In July 2015, Soon-Shiong initiated an IPO for NantKwest (formerly ConkWest) that represented the highest value biotech IPO in history, at a market value of $2.6 billion.[26] In April 2016, the Los Angeles Times reported that Soon-Shiong received a pay package in 2015 from NantKwest worth almost $148 Million, making him one of the highest paid CEOs.[5] Soon-Shiong is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[27][28]

"The History of Pancreas Transplantation: Past, Present and Future". Acta Chir Belg. 108 (3, May-June): 367–378. PMID 18710120. The first attempt to cure type 1 diabetes by pancreas transplantation was done at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on December 17, 1966… [This] opened the door to a period, between the mid-[1970s] to mid-[1980s] where only segmental pancreatic grafts were used... In the late [1970s] – early [1980s], three major events… boosted the development of pancreas transplantation… [At] the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid-[1980s] and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas. During the modern era of immunosuppression, the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion became the gold standard… [for SPK, PAK, PTA]. CS1 maint: Uses authors parameter (link)

H
e’s spent years pushing to revolutionize health care, developing software systems for hospitals, a new genetic test for patients, and a slew of experimental cancer drugs.
Now, biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong can run real-life experiments to test his vision. One of his foundations last year took control of a nonprofit hospital in Pennsylvania, and one of his businesses this summer took over six more in California. Last week, he also opened a new cancer center in El Segundo, Calif., down the street from Los Angeles International Airport.
He has made clear that he views his new medical facilities as laboratories for his approach and his products. That’s likely to be good for Soon-Shiong. The key question: Is it also good for patients?
advertisement






Take his new El Segundo cancer center. He appears to be planning to use his pricey diagnostic test, GPS Cancer, routinely there. That would help one of his companies, which has struggled to sell the test nationally. It’s less clear whether patients will benefit: There’s no published data showing if this test works better than — or even as well as — any comparable tool on the market.
His team has also laid out plans to enroll virtually every patient at his cancer center in clinical trials. But the only two trials listed on the center’s website are testing highly experimental therapies being developed through Soon-Shiong’s for-profit businesses.
Another wrinkle: The three doctors running the clinic are also employed by Soon-Shiong’s companies — the very companies that are selling the diagnostic and developing the drugs they will consider using on patients.
This isn’t how drug development normally works. Indeed, Soon-Shiong’s arrangement stands out as highly unusual. Most drug companies don’t have their own employees setting up medical clinics to treat patients with therapies that are still being investigated. Instead, they undertake a painstaking process of introducing their experimental drugs to physician-researchers across the country and seeking permission to set up trial sites at independent hospitals. Asked if Soon-Shiong’s companies will have more traditional clinical trial sites elsewhere, his spokeswoman didn’t answer.

						He vowed to cure cancer. But this billionaire’s moonshot is falling far short of the hype					


The spokeswoman, Jen Hodson, told STAT that there should be no concern about any of the arrangements, saying that Soon-Shiong always puts patients first. But ethics experts say there’s a clear potential for multiple conflicts of interest as he moves aggressively into patient care.
For instance, the small, rural nonprofit hospital in Pennsylvania that’s controlled by Soon-Shiong’s foundation agreed last year to pay $1.2 million over three years to license software marketed by one of Soon-Shiong’s companies, NantHealth. The hospital wouldn’t say whether there was a competitive bidding process. Neither would Soon-Shiong’s team.
‘There are no conflicts’
When STAT first sent Hodson questions about how Soon-Shiong’s team is handling the potential conflicts, she responded quickly with a brief email: “There are no conflicts.”
A few days later, after more questions, Hodson directed STAT to a conflict of interest policy for the El Segundo clinic. It requires the staff to disclose their financial ties to Soon-Shiong’s businesses when they’re enrolling patients in clinical trials of Soon-Shiong’s drugs. It also says independent third parties will monitor the trials.
“We are well aware of the issues you raise, have been proactively and well advised by third parties and taken the appropriate steps to address them,” Hodson said.
Responding to some of STAT’s questions in another email, Hodson said it was “false” to suggest that the medical facilities might be improperly swayed toward using Soon-Shiong’s products. “Dr. Soon-Shiong always puts the best interest of the patient first. His decisions are, and have always been guided by what is in the patients’ best interest,” she said.

On one of the issues STAT raised in its questions, Soon-Shiong has changed course.
One of his companies, NantWorks, now owns a majority stake in the management company operating the six nonprofit hospitals in California. A press release jointly issued two weeks ago by NantWorks and the hospital chain said that Soon-Shiong would take a seat on the chain’s board of directors.
That raised some concern among medical ethics experts consulted by STAT. They noted that the board of directors is generally meant to be an independent advocate for the hospitals’ patients and mission — a body that can challenge the management company when needed. Having Soon-Shiong sit on that board and also control the management company would be atypical in the world of nonprofit hospitals, said James Orlikoff, a consultant who helps hospitals steer clear of conflicts of interest.
“From a good governance perspective, it’s questionable at best,” Orlikoff said.
Following questions from STAT, Hodson said Soon-Shiong’s plans had changed and he would no longer take a seat on the board.
Outside experts see ethical land mines
At STAT’s request, half a dozen experts in fields like hospital governance and medical ethics agreed to review publicly available information about Soon-Shiong’s expanding business interests in patient care.
All of them said they saw potential ethical land mines.
“There needs to be some clarity and transparency about what these relationships actually are,” said Dr. Bernard Lo, an internist and president of the Greenwall Foundation, which funds bioethics research. Without that information, Lo said, “you don’t know whether decisions are being made under undue influence and not in the best interests of the patient.”
The arrangements could spur the “use of services that are not medically indicated,” said Dr. Steven Joffe, a pediatric oncologist who studies medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania. He said he’s also concerned that the nonprofit hospitals could be pressed into “choosing a service provider that is not the best and/or the least expensive.”
Questions about conflicts of interest have swirled around Soon-Shiong before. STAT reported earlier this year that Soon-Shiong’s big moonshot initiative to cure cancer has become an elaborate marketing vehicle for his GPS Cancer diagnostic tool. Another STAT investigation found that a donation from Soon-Shiong to the University of Utah brought him commercial benefit. And Politico has reported on other ways that Soon-Shiong’s philanthropy has advanced his business interests.

To be sure, Soon-Shiong is far from alone in blending business interests with patient care. And such arrangements offer potential benefit, if patients can get access to cutting-edge therapies and technologies that might not otherwise be available to them.
But studies show that such arrangements can also push patients toward expensive and unneeded treatments. For example, when men with prostate cancer get referred to a clinic where their urologist has a financial stake, they’re much more likely to get an expensive treatment known as intensity-modulated radiation therapy, even though it doesn’t work any better than cheaper alternatives, a 2013 study found.
Other studies have shown that physicians with financial interests in laboratories tend to order more tests.
Concern over such conflicts prompted Congress to enact a federal statute known as the Stark Law. First passed in 1989 and amended over the years, it bars physicians from sending patients covered by Medicaid or Medicare to undergo certain services at clinics where the doctor has a financial interest. (There are many exceptions to the Stark Law, and it’s unclear from available information whether Soon-Shiong’s new ventures could be in violation, said Joan Krause, a law professor at the University of North Carolina.)

Soon-Shiong’s first foray into the business of patient care came last year when he took control of a small hospital in the tiny town of Windber in southwestern Pennsylvania. And it’s there that some of the potential conflicts of interests identified by STAT have already surfaced.
Opened by a coal mining company more than a century ago, the hospital is in the heart of mining country — unusual territory for a cosmopolitan billionaire from Los Angeles.
But the hospital is affiliated with a research institute, and it held a treasure that reportedly caught Soon-Shiong’s eye: a repository storing tens of thousands of tissue and blood samples from patients with breast cancer and other conditions. Access to such samples could help Soon-Shiong develop diagnostic products, as well as further his team’s research into cancer therapies.
He soon came to see the local hospital, which has about 54 beds and employs about 450 people, as a showcase for his bigger ideas about reforming health care delivery.

In 2015, the Windber hospital’s board agreed to transfer control to Soon-Shiong’s NantHealth Foundation. The Pennsylvania attorney general’s office approved the transaction at the start of 2016. Soon-Shiong’s foundation now financially backs and controls the hospital. (It does not control the research institute.)
Windber Medical Center was soon renamed the Chan Soon-Shiong Medical Center at Windber — after Soon-Shiong and his wife, the former television actress Michele Chan.
It didn’t take long for Soon-Shiong to start integrating Windber into his empire: The hospital’s CEO was quoted in the press release Soon-Shiong’s team put out in January 2016 saying that Windber’s tissue bank “will be utilized as the tissue repository resource to support” the clinical trial program Soon-Shiong was launching as part of his new cancer moonshot initiative.
Also in the first year, the Windber hospital placed a three-year order for “software-as-a-service solutions” marketed by Soon-Shiong’s company NantHealth. The cost: $200,000 a year plus a one-time fee of $600,000, according to an April filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It’s impossible to tell how much similar software from competitors would cost for a hospital of that size, because the SEC filing didn’t specify exactly what was purchased.
If the deal — which represented just a small chunk of NantHealth’s $58 million in reported revenue last year from that category of software — was made after a competitive bidding process and a review by hospital staffers, it certainly could be ethically sound, said Lo, the internist and bioethics expert. But it’s unclear whether that happened.
Neither Hodson nor the Windber hospital would say how the decision was made. (The hospital’s spokeswoman, Natalie Bombatch, referred nearly all of STAT’s questions to Soon-Shiong’s team.)
Hodson offered only a general statement that transactions between the Windber hospital and Soon-Shiong’s companies “will be reviewed and approved by disinterested directors and officers in accordance with their respective conflict of interest policies.”


“Dr. Soon-Shiong always puts the best interest of the patient first.”

Jen Hodson, spokeswoman for Soon-Shiong




Control of the Windber hospital has also opened a new market for another one of Soon-Shiong’s products, GPS Cancer, which recommends treatments based on the genetics of a patient’s cancer. It’s not clear how many patients at Windber have taken the GPS Cancer test. But at least one patient told the local newspaper, The Tribune-Democrat, that she got it last fall — at a time when there were few other takers for the test, which analysts estimate costs about $11,000.
STAT reached out to several oncologists at the Windber hospital seeking to talk about whether Soon-Shiong’s control affected clinical practice. The only one who responded said she wasn’t in a position to comment.

						Soon-Shiong rails against ‘false reporting’ as he announces lackluster sales					


Soon-Shiong’s team touts GPS Cancer as backed by clinical evidence, but there are no published data comparing it in head-to-head trials with other diagnostic tools. And, in part because the test has only been on the market for about a year, there are no published studies showing whether it extends patients’ lives.
In one study that Soon-Shiong’s team has touted, Indiana University researchers looked at 139 patients who took the GPS Cancer test and found that 83.5 percent of them got clinically useful information — though just 26 percent of that smaller group actually received a therapy matched to their tumor genetics.
The study did not look at whether the test’s unique qualities — it analyzes protein expression as well carrying out more run-of-the-mill genetic sequencing — yielded any actionable information above and beyond what patients could have gotten from cheaper genetic tests on the market.
The Indiana researchers presented the study this spring as a poster at the big annual gathering of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and are now preparing it for publication.
Using hospitals for the poor as ‘an experiment at scale’
Soon-Shiong didn’t hold back earlier this month when describing his plans for the investment that gave him control of the six California hospitals that make up the nonprofit chain known as Verity Health.
“I’ve spent the last decade of my life quietly building this infrastructure,” he told the Los Angeles Times. (He owns a stake in the newspaper’s parent company.) “This [hospital] system will provide an experiment at scale.”
Those words raised alarm bells for Dr. Jeff Smith, the executive of Santa Clara County, which is home to two of the Verity hospitals that, like the rest of the chain, mostly serve low-income patients.
“If Dr. Soon-Shiong is focused on entrepreneurship and profitability and high intervention experimental procedures, there’s no way that that can be done at these two hospitals without basically tossing the poor people out of the queue,” said Smith, who trained as a family practitioner. (His county unsuccessfully tried to buy the two hospitals a few years ago.)
The Verity hospitals are not now using products made by Soon-Shiong’s companies, according to Hodson.
Soon-Shiong has pledged to invest in the hospitals and expand cancer care, as well as orthopedic and cardiology services. He doesn’t like referring to Verity facilities as “safety net hospitals,” he said at an event broadcast online last week, pledging to ensure that the low-income patients have “as much care, and state of the art care, as if they came from Beverly Hills.”

Asked how Verity is handling the potential conflicts of interest associated with Soon-Shiong’s investment, the hospital chain’s spokeswoman, Jane Brust, initially referred all questions to Soon-Shiong’s team.
Later, Brust said the chain has policies in place “to allow our Board of Directors and management to identify and evaluate potential conflicts of interest.” She didn’t respond to STAT’s questions about what those policies entail and how they might be applied in this case, given that the management company making decisions is owned by Soon-Shiong.
Promising treatment so new, it hasn’t even been tested in humans
Ever the showman, Soon-Shiong has set sky-high expectations for his new cancer clinic in El Segundo. He’s said that Los Angeles lacks a world-class cancer center and suggested that his new facility will change that.
And at a ribbon-cutting ceremony last week, Soon-Shiong pronounced the new center “the American Red Cross of cancer” — a reference to his claim that his team can grow an unlimited supply of “natural killer” cells to build the experimental therapies he’s now testing.
For one formulation of the natural killer cell therapy, Soon-Shiong promised his crowd, “the first-in-human studies will be done right here.”
It’s not clear who owns the private clinic, which is named for Soon-Shiong and his wife; Hodson said last month that Soon-Shiong is not the owner. Soon-Shiong has said on Twitter that he’s a co-director; he’s also the only member of the center’s board of trustees listed on its website.

						Soon-Shiong’s top executive steps down at NantHealth					


The three other doctors running the center are all employees of various Soon-Shiong businesses.
Co-directors Dr. John Lee and Dr. Leonard Sender both work for NantKwest, which is developing the natural killer cell therapy. Dr. Sandeep Reddy also holds down a job as NantHealth’s chief medical officer, overseeing clinical trials for GPS Cancer.
The cancer center’s conflict of interest policy, which Hodson said has been in place “from the outset,” allows clinical investigators to have disclosed financial interests with medical companies “only if it furthers and enhances” the cancer center’s mission. The policy also states that clinical trials will be monitored by independent third parties — a clinical research organization and a data and safety review board. Those are routine features of clinical trials.
Lo, the internist and bioethics expert, reviewed the policy at STAT’s request and said it lacks several crucial components that would “considerably strengthen it and provide greater assurance that [conflicts of interest] are being appropriately managed.”
It doesn’t, for example, say who will review financial disclosures to determine if further steps need to be taken. Nor does it say whether clinical trial protocols will be peer reviewed by other scientists beyond the necessary stamps of approval from the Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board.


“There needs to be some clarity and transparency about what these relationships actually are.”

Dr. Bernard Lo, bioethicist




Though Soon-Shiong has suggested the center will be a world-class facility, it’s unclear whether it will offer any routine treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery. Hodson did not answer STAT’s questions about the center’s services.
Sender, one of the cancer center’s co-directors, told the local newspaper, the Daily Breeze, that his goal is to get close to 100 percent of patients enrolled in clinical trials.
That raises a big question of how the clinic plans to make money; it’s uncommon and widely considered unethical to charge patients to participate in clinical trials. Hodson would not answer questions about the clinic’s business model.
Another question: Whether the center will send patients to big hospitals, such as the academic medical centers in Los Angeles, to get access to a broad range of trials, or whether the doctors will focus on enrolling patients just in the two trials listed on the clinic’s website — both of which are sponsored by Soon-Shiong’s companies to test their experimental drugs.

						Who’s the billionaire doctor palling around with Donald Trump?					


One of those trials is a Phase 1 study of natural killer cell therapy; it will test whether the therapy is safe in patients with advanced solid tumors.
The second trial will test combination therapies involving experimental vaccines in patients with pancreatic cancer that has progressed despite first-line treatment. It will start out testing the safety of the combination therapy and then evolve into testing whether it works.
One of the vaccines being used in the trial has shown encouraging early results in patients with advanced colorectal cancer; another vaccine in 2012 failed a mid-stage trial where it was combined with a type of chemotherapy and used in pancreatic cancer patients.
The center’s website doesn’t explicitly mention Soon-Shiong’s GPS Cancer, but it suggests that the product will be central to treatment decisions. The center’s philosophy, after all, is to make “molecularly informed decisions” by analyzing both the genetics and the expressed proteins of a tumor. That’s exactly how GPS Cancer is marketed. The website seems to suggest that the test might be used multiple times in a single patient, to track “spatiotemporal tumor evolution” and to direct treatment decisions.
And a recent press release trumpeting plans for the pancreatic cancer trial stated that GPS Cancer will be used to “molecularly inform” the combination therapy’s design, which will also involve approved chemotherapies, natural killer cells, and another experimental compound.
Whether patients considering seeking care at Soon-Shiong’s cancer center will understand the highly experimental nature of the drugs being tested is not clear.
This past March, Soon-Shiong repeatedly retweeted a video put out by one of his companies that described his natural killer therapy this way: “NEW BREAKTHROUGH HELPS PATIENTS KILL CANCER.” The video appeared to violate federal regulations barring the promotion of drugs that haven’t yet been approved by the FDA.
After STAT raised questions about the video, it was taken down from social media and re-edited multiple times to tone down the banner headline and delete suggestions that the therapy had cured at least one patient.
More recently, Soon-Shiong retweeted his new cancer center’s pledge to deliver “unique Natural Killer cell and immunologically based treatment to our patients.”
He and the center also turned to Twitter to circulate a link to a TV news story about the center’s opening from the local CBS affiliate. Above a chyron referencing “killer cells,” the reporter proclaims that “this state of the art institute” is “the only place in the U.S.” to use this new approach to fighting cancer.
Not mentioned: The approach is nowhere near being approved by the FDA.

If no laws are being violated, why can’t Soon-Shiong, or any one of the handful of new entrants into biopharma, i.e. Amazon, Google, IBM, seek a better alternative to the status quo? 
This article seems to throw a lot of shade, with lines like:
“it’s unclear from available information whether Soon-Shiong’s new ventures could be in violation (of Stark Law),”
“it certainly could be ethically sound, said Lo, the internist and bioethics expert. But it’s unclear whether that happened.”
“That raises a big question of how the clinic plans to make money; it’s uncommon and widely considered unethical to charge patients to participate in clinical trials,” as if there is a controversy there.
This article makes it sound like biopharma and the healthcare industry are pure not-for-profit communities being violated by this one man, conveniently leaving out how unhappy Americans are with the doctor-pharma-Insurance relationships that have led to prices 10-to-1000 times what other OECD countries pay.  Americans want change, so much so, that even against the heavy lobbying of the healthcare industry, Congress and Trump appear ready to enact change.
Responsible journalism should look at the possibilities of revolution, not spread non-factual fears.

This definitely parallels the trick physicians have used to make extra money, sending their patients’ labs to ones they have ownership in and writting ointment scripts (that differ from commercially available ones by a small percent) to be filled by their own compounding pharmacy.  We don’t let docs do this at the small practice level, why should he getaway with doing this at the large hospital level.

Reply 





Rebecca, you and your editors seem to have a very biased view on cancer research and development. It’s unfortunate that someone who doesn’t need to work a day in their life is being brought down by people like you. In any phase 1 trial, its common to have the company run the trial. Phase 2 can be done independently. Look at Roche and foundation medicine, they sell a test and do clinical trials too. If the good doc didn’t buy the hospitals, they would have been run to the ground. Shame on you and your editorial team, I’m going to tell everyone how horrible stat news is. Really disappointed in Stat

I wonder why nobody turned this into a race issue.

This is old new a month ago being rehashed. I am baffled by why a multi-billionaire who signed Buffett’s GivingPledge to give away majority of his wealth suddenly turn into a con artist at age of 65. 
This guys is controversial, no doubt, partly because he is a self-made man and he doesn’t seem to give a damn about what other people think.
https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2014/09/10/medicines-manhattan-project-can-the-worlds-richest-doctor-fix-health-care/#5c32e973ac3f
He could have asked U. of Utah to name 5 buildings with his name for his donation, but instead, he asks U. of Utah to try out his product that will benefit their patients. Gray area, but is it because he wants to make extra couple bucks or does he really believe that his product will one day cure cancer? He is also probably not the first philanthropist or foundation who’s “self-dealing”. The Soon-Shiong bashing (10 articles on STAT) seems excessive. Maybe there is alternative motive as the other commenter pointed out. 
We call guys like Elon Musk (he wants to colonize space!) visionaries, but Soon-Shiong as “showman” because he claims curing cancer is possible. Watching his interviews, he sounded quite down to earth to me. 
Anyway, let’s hope he finds that algorithm.

The question should be asked where Rebecca is getting this information from?  She has no investigative journalism experience, and very little journalism experience and is being fed this information from sources simply trying to malign Soon Shiong.  The likely candidates are Tronc, where he is fighting a nasty battle for control, and short sellers who have made large profits on the declining price of NantKwest and NantHealth.  In the era of email hacks, the integrity of a writer who is being fed stolen emails and cherry-picks snippets of information should be questioned.  But honestly, I have to thank her, as I am buying shares of NantKwest on the cheap and will continue to do so.  So thanks Rebecca for being so naive.  I wonder if this comment will stay up on the site, or if Stat will pull it down since they really dont care about the integrity of their journalism?

Reply 





Not stolen if the emails came from someone who received them.  Which is how this happened in the days before hackers. 
People who had either had concerns about the university and its association with NantHealth or investors concerned they are being sold a false narrative, if I may use a Trumpian term.







Tina – Her article cites emails circulated at the University AND NantHealth.  If she got internal emails from NantHealth, then someone has violated their confidentiality agreement.  But the real interesting point is that she got emails from BOTH sources. This points to an email hack, not a single internal source. And for someone to put that effort into it, there is usually a financial incentive.  But honestly, if that single quote “It will help our product” is the only quote they could find to implicate Soon Shiong in wrong-doing, then she has absolutely nothing.   Will any real news outlet cover this?  I doubt it.   NantHealth’s response with emails from the physicians demonstrated that Rebecca ignores any facts that contradict her story.









I want to thank STAT for its excellent investigative journalism.

For weeks, biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has been taking to social media to portray himself as a valiant warrior against cancer, unfairly maligned by the press.
He and his diagnostics company, NantHealth, have strenuously denied reports that they reaped benefits from a $12 million gift he made to support medical research at the University of Utah.
But emails and documents obtained by STAT make clear that executives at NantHealth and officials at the university viewed the deal through a transactional lens, intended, at least in part, to boost Soon-Shiong’s commercial interests.
The deal with Utah — which gave Soon-Shiong’s team access to genetic and health data on hundreds of patients — “will help us with our product,” Larry Fitzgerald, a NantHealth vice president, wrote in an email.
STAT reported last month that the university sent $10 million of Soon-Shiong’s $12 million gift right back to NantHealth to pay for genetic sequencing of blood, tissue, and tumor samples. Soon-Shiong, a showy entrepreneur who has vowed to “solve cancer,” denied that the contract had been set up to funnel money to his company or that he had benefited from the arrangement.
But those denials are contradicted by more than a dozen documents STAT obtained from critics of the deal, including email chains and internal memos that circulated at the university and at NantHealth as the deal was being planned and executed. They show that the plan to steer business back to Soon-Shiong and give him access to patient data to improve his product was baked into the deal from early on. Among the findings:

A university memorandum from September 2014, days before the donation was made official, stipulates that the genetic analysis to be paid for by Soon-Shiong’s gift would be done by Soon-Shiong’s team.
Another document circulated within the university noted that one of Soon-Shiong’s companies would for a time keep copies of the patient data involved in the sequencing job — and would use it to develop its “sequencing and bioinformatics platform.” Internal emails from NantHealth executives also indicated that they explicitly saw the deal as a means to boost their business.
Though the deal was built around the idea that Soon-Shiong’s lab would do the genetic sequencing, the company was not yet prepared to do that work when the contract was signed. Emails show at least one NantHealth executive was scrambling to try to delay the university from visiting the lab because the company had not yet formally confirmed that its new DNA sequencing machines were working properly.

The documents offer new details about the way Soon-Shiong’s philanthropic and business interests intertwine. They deepen ethical and legal questions surrounding his donation to the University of Utah. And they raise new questions about why the university agreed to accept a gift on the understanding that it would send most of the money back to the donor’s company — especially when that company wasn’t yet ready to do the work.
READ NEXT: Soon-Shiong’s promotion of ‘breakthrough’ cancer therapy raises questions
NantHealth spokeswoman Jen Hodson said the documents in no way proved that the deal was structured to send money back to Soon-Shiong’s company, even though they repeatedly show early evidence of plans to do just that.
Hodson said the university was free to pay any qualified company to do the sequencing — though the university told its own scientists early on that “a bioinformatics team associated with the Donor” would be doing the work. (That memo was dated four and a half months before the university inked its research contract with NantHealth.)
Hodson also denied that Soon-Shiong reaped gains from the deal and said his companies did the work for Utah at a loss.
“There was no commercial benefit,” she wrote in response to STAT’s questions. “However there was a significant benefit to the learning system of mankind.” She referred to a recent paper about early-onset menopause that came out of the scientific research funded by Soon-Shiong’s donation.
Both Hodson and University of Utah spokeswoman Julie Kiefer said that NantHealth was transparent with the university that it was still getting its genetic sequencing machines ready for prime time, though the emails STAT reviewed suggest that at least one executive was worried about how much they still had to do.
“I worked to put them off a bit to later in March—so not to disclose we still have work to do on the validation front of samples,” NantHealth executive Laura Beggrow wrote to the company’s president in February of 2015, referring to the University of Utah team.
A defiant stance on social media
Soon-Shiong, NantHealth’s majority owner and CEO, has repeatedly used Twitter in recent weeks to dismiss his critics and to suggest that they’re out to derail him as he pursues the noble goal of curing cancer.

Nobody should be a target just because they want to help our country. Cancer affects all Americans …Red and Blue https://t.co/LH7eiiEHM0
— Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) April 12, 2017

In his most recent tweets, Soon-Shiong blames the critical coverage on the fact that he met at least twice with President Trump prior to the inauguration. In January he was said to be in talks for a senior role in the administration overseeing the US health care system. That buzz has since quieted.

Politico/STAT attacks anyone who meets @POTUS to serve USA.Important to give back.That’s why I am doing what I do:https://t.co/9hMuYfhXWV
— Dr. Pat Soon-Shiong (@DrPatSoonShiong) April 12, 2017

STAT’s previous coverage of Soon-Shiong included the finding that his ballyhooed moonshot initiative, which aims to cure cancer by 2020, achieved little scientific progress in its first year, and instead became mostly a marketing tool for NantHealth’s pricey new diagnostic test, called GPS Cancer.
The STAT investigation of the Utah deal found that the arrangement could put Soon-Shiong and his foundations in violation of tax rules against indirect self-dealing. Since the publication of that investigation, NantHealth’s stock price has sunk 46 percent, to $3.86 per share, and at least three investors have filed suit against Soon-Shiong and NantHealth, alleging violations of federal securities law.
A Politico investigation last weekend found other examples of Soon-Shiong’s charitable foundations operating in a way that benefited his business interests.
NantHealth lost $184 million last year, the company reported last month.
‘It will help us with our product’
In the days before Soon-Shiong formalized his donation to the University of Utah, the university wrote up the terms in an informal memorandum of understanding, dated early September 2014.
The memo, circulated at the university, said academics could participate in research funded by the donation, so long as they agreed to various stipulations, such as that genetic analysis would be carried out “by a bioinformatics team associated with the Donor.”
The memo also says that “Donor-affiliated Scientists shall have the right to analyze the sequence data for any or all of the Heritage 1K projects,” which was the university’s umbrella term for the research funded by Soon-Shiong’s donation. (The memo indicated Soon-Shiong’s team would be able to keep that data for two years.)
READ NEXT: Soon-Shiong made ‘implicit threat’ to spur investment in NantHealth, media company says
Kiefer, the university spokesperson, said the memorandum did not commit the university to awarding the sequencing contract to NantHealth. She previously told STAT that the university looked around to see whether other facilities could meet the very detailed specifications in Soon-Shiong’s gift contract, but none of them could — except NantHealth and its associated lab, NantOmics.
The deal gave NantHealth access to lots of valuable data associated with the hundreds of samples it sequenced and analyzed for Utah scientists. The company learned which diseases ran in each patient’s family. Whether they were affected by certain medical conditions. And how closely they were related to other people who provided samples for analysis. (The patients’ identities were not disclosed.)
The contract prohibited Soon-Shiong’s team from using the data for purposes beyond the work it had been contracted to do. But it did allow a crucial exception: The owner of any algorithm could retain all improvements made to the algorithm in the course of performing the job.
That was a boon for Soon-Shiong’s business, because the algorithms that sift through large quantities of genetic data to identify patterns for researchers also power his commercial products, like his GPS Cancer diagnostic tool. He was also working on developing a second product, GPS Heritage, meant to assess a patient’s risk of inherited and rare diseases.
Soon-Shiong has denied that the Utah deal had anything to do with the development of GPS Heritage. But a company statement to investors belies that assertion; it explicitly says that the deal with University of Utah “will enable the development” of the new GPS Heritage product.
And the emails reviewed by STAT show that at least two top NantHealth employees saw the deal through a commercial lens.
“I know this research project is taking place with NantOmics and more to refine our algorithms. It will help us with our product,” Fitzgerald, the NantHealth vice president, wrote in an email dated in April 2015 and sent to colleagues.
“Larry is correct,” responded Beggrow, the company’s chief commercial officer.
(Hodson told STAT that, in fact, “the algorithms themselves were not affected or improved by the addition of these data.”)
In the earlier email to NantHealth’s president about the research project, Beggrow had suggested there was room for Soon-Shiong’s team to achieve even greater commercial gain, though she provided few specifics.
“I believe we all need to work collectively with effective communication throughout all of our Nant Families,” she wrote in February 2015, “and to optimize these opportunities for upselling along the way.”
Both Fitzgerald and Beggrow have since left NantHealth and are both now employed at a different biotech company. Neither returned STAT’s repeated requests for comment on their emails.
‘The ethics are messy’
Another University of Utah document, circulated in December 2014, underscored the point that that Soon-Shiong’s team planned to use the research data for commercial gain: “NantOmics will retain the data and DNA sequence for development of their sequencing and bioinformatics platform,” the document reads.
That document gave academics suggestions on revising their research protocols so as to allow Soon-Shiong’s team access to the patient data.

It’s common for scientists to ask their institutional review board to approve changes to their research protocol mid-way through a study. They must generally do so, for instance, any time they want to interrogate a new question.
But two experts who study institutional review boards and reviewed the University of Utah documents at STAT’s request saw potential ethical land mines in the deal.
Karen Maschke of the Hastings Center said it raised questions about what patients were originally told would happen to their samples when they agreed to provide them: Did they know, for instance, that their genetic and health data might be shared with a for-profit business?
Jennifer Miller, founder of the nonprofit Bioethics International, said that while the deal seemed to pose minimal privacy risks to patients, “The optics are bad and the ethics are messy.”
A lab not yet ready to carry out its work
Not long before the University of Utah deal was signed, Soon-Shiong’s team bought a new brand of sequencing machine, called the HiSeq X10 and sold by Illumina.
When a lab buys new machines, it can’t just start performing work for clients right away. There’s an involved process of developing new protocols, ensuring they work robustly, and then validating the performance of machines with a formal test, according to Heidi Rehm, medical director of the clinical sequencing research platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
Soon-Shiong’s team wasn’t using its machines to commercially diagnose patients at that point — they were just for research — so the validation wasn’t as complex. But it likely still would have involved running benchmarked samples through a start-to-finish process to ensure the machines were sequencing the DNA properly, Rehm said.
Beggrow’s February 2015 email indicates that NantOmics was at that time not yet ready to do the sequencing for Utah, even though the university had been planning for at least five months to have Soon-Shiong’s team do the work.
The NantOmics lab “hasn’t yet even begun to do validation work on samples,” Beggrow wrote.
She added that she “did NOT want to disclose this to this account [at the University of Utah] that we aren’t ready to accept their actual 1000 retro samples.”
Kiefer said the university knew “that this was a new state of the art facility and that the new equipment would require validation testing.” She added that the university did not start paying NantHealth “until it had been verified that the sequencing met the high standards documented in the contract.”
Hodson said that “nothing was hidden from the University of Utah.” The validation work Beggrow mentions in her email, Hodson said, “refers specifically to the University’s demand that NantOmics validate the accuracy and quality of the sequencing data against the University of Utah’s own work with other external vendors, by performing analyses of test samples.”
When it came to delaying the University of Utah’s lab visit, Hodson said, “This timing was openly communicated by NantOmics to the University scientists and it may be that NantHealth and NantOmics employee were not communicating the timely information back to one another.”

Dr Soon-Shiong acquires GlowCaps-maker VitalityBy Brian DolanFebruary 02, 2011

Share






 
Pharma entrepreneur and billionaire Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong has acquired Vitality, the company that developed GlowCaps. Vitality CEO David Rose stated in the company press release that while the financial terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed, Vitality's investors achieved a ten-fold return on their investments. In 2009 InformationWeek reported that the company had raised about $4 million, including investments from Dr. Soon-Shiong.
The Boston Globe reports that Dr. Soon-Shiong negotiated the deal with Vitality's co-founders courtside at an LA Lakers game. Dr. Soon-Shiong is partial owner of the team.
Vitality's flagship product, GlowCaps "illuminate, play a melody, and even ring a home phone so patients don't forget to take their medication," according to the company's description. "GlowCaps send weekly emails to remote caregivers, create accountability with physicians through adherence reports, and automatically refill prescriptions."
Dr. Soon-Shiong expects to help Vitality expand it product line up to other wireless health products for consumers. (Dr. Soon-Shiong is also the executive director of UCLA's Wireless Health Institute -- MobiHealthNews interviewed him in May 2009 about his views on wireless health.)
GlowCaps improved adherence rates in a study conducted by Partners Health Care by 27 percent -- leading to adherence rates of 98 percent. AT&T has also been a big supporter of Vitality -- its network provides the connectivity for GlowCaps. Earlier this month AT&T and Vitality announced they would begin selling cellular-enabled GlowCaps through Amazon.com.
“Our country needs a health care system designed to keep people healthy rather than waiting for them to get sick,” Soon-Shiong stated in the release. “As part of this goal, medication adherence is key. However, many people do not take their medications as prescribed which leads to unnecessary sickness and costly hospitalizations. GlowCaps addresses this problem brilliantly making the medication packaging smart.”
Vitality Co-founder and President Joshua Wachman was quoted in an interview with the Boston Globe: "Our roadmap is to create more things that help people make better decisions every day. We think about things like tracking vitamins and pills, the food you eat, your stress level, or your sleep quality. We're really in the behavior-change business."
Both Rose and Wachman will stay on as CEO and President, respectively, according to the company. Vitality will also keeps its management headquarters in Cambridge, MA, but it plans to hire additional local resources. It also already has teams in Los Angeles, San Diego and Toronto.
Read on for the full press release:

“Our country needs a health care system designed to keep people healthy rather than waiting for them to get sick,” said Soon-Shiong. “As part of this goal, medication adherence is key.  However, many people do not take their medications as prescribed which leads to unnecessary sickness and costly hospitalizations. GlowCaps addresses this problem brilliantly making the medication packaging smart.”
AT&T was selected in 2010 to provide the wireless network connection for Vitality GlowCaps.  Earlier this month, AT&T and Vitality announced the availability of GlowCaps on Amazon.  "This is an exciting product for consumers who need a reliable means to establish and maintain a prescription routine," said Glenn Lurie, President, Emerging Devices, AT&T.  "The solution is simple, easy to set up and use and long overdue."
“Vitality’s suite of connected health and wellness products dovetails perfectly with Dr. Soon-Shiong’s vision and expressed goals,” said David Rose, Chief Executive Officer of Vitality.  “This transaction brings together like minds and provides us with an opportunity to embark on the next phase of growth.”  Rose noted that while the terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the acquisition represents a 10-fold return on investment to Vitality’s investors.
“We also are proud of the emerging new business model for connected health that supports giving away GlowCaps to large populations,” said Joshua Wachman, Co-founder and President of Vitality. “Fortune 500 companies desperately need GlowCaps and other tools to control skyrocketing health care costs. Vitality’s acquisition fuels GlowCaps to become the industry standard for medication packaging.”
Vitality’s current management team will continue to work from its Cambridge, MA office and will hire additional local resources, complementing teams in Los Angeles, San Diego and Toronto. Vitality co-founders David Rose and Joshua Wachman will continue to operate Vitality as Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively.

Patrick Soon-Shiong, MD, a physician, surgeon, researcher, philanthropist and scientist, invented and developed the revolutionary drug Abraxane, which has received FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, lung cancer and advanced pancreatic cancer. Abraxane is the only drug of its kind to be approved in first line therapies across this broad spectrum of tumors in both the U.S. and E.U. Over the course of Dr. Soon-Shiong’s career, he has pioneered novel therapies for both diabetes and cancer, published over 100 scientific papers, and has issued over 230 patents worldwide for groundbreaking advancements spanning myriad fields of technology and medicine. As a surgeon, Dr. Soon-Shiong performed the world’s first encapsulated human islet transplant, the first engineered islet cell transplant and the first pig to man islet cell transplant in diabetic patients.
In the early 1990’s, Dr. Soon-Shiong pursued the science of stem cell and nanotechnology at NASA, performing experiments as part of the Shuttle program. Soon-Shiong’s path to cancer research began while doing research for NASA that involved harnessing stem cells to make insulin. In 1991, he founded a biotechnology company to develop a novel nanoparticle anticancer drug with the concept of using “the tumors biology against itself”.
From 1997- 2010, Dr. Soon-Shiong served as Founder, Chairman and CEO of two global pharmaceutical companies: American Pharmaceutical Partners and Abraxis BioScience.

Early life and education[edit]
Soon-Shiong was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Chinese immigrant parents who fled from China during the Japanese occupation in World War II.[6][7] His parents were originally from Toisan in Guangdong, China,[7] from among the Hakka people and language group.[6] He graduated from high school at age 16.[8][verification needed]
University and post-graduate training/medicine[edit]
Soon-Shiong studied on scholarship and graduated 4th out of his class of 189 from the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a combined Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh) medical degree at age 23.[8] He completed his medical internship at Johannesburg’s General Hospital.[when?][citation needed] He then studied at the University of British Columbia, where he earned a MSc degree, with research awards from the American College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Association of Academic Surgery (the first resident of the university to do so).[9][dead link] He moved to the United States and began surgical training at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon.[citation needed] Soon-Shiong is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Canada) and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons.[9][dead link][3]Soon-Shiong joined UCLA Medical School in 1983 and served on that faculty until 1991,[3][self-published source?] during which time he was a practicing transplant surgeon.[6] Between 1984 and 1987, he served as an associate investigator at the Center for Ulcer Research and Education.[3][self-published source?] Soon-Shiong performed the first whole-pancreas transplant done at UCLA,[when?][10][11] and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant,[when?] and the "first pig-to-[hu]man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients."[when?][10][better source needed] After a period in industry, he returned to UCLA in 2009,[citation needed] serving as a professor of microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics and bioengineering until this date.[when?][citation needed] Soon-Shiong served as a Visiting Professor at Imperial College, London in 2011.[12][dead link]
Entrepreneurial activities[edit]
In 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm. This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals (APP), of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to Fresenius SE for $4.6 billion in July 2008.[13][dead link] Soon-Shiong later founded Abraxis BioScience (maker of the drug Abraxane he co-discovered),[14] a company he sold to Celgene in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.[15](subscription required)
Soon-Shiong founded NantHealth in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information.[16] Soon-Shiong went on to found NantWorks in September 2011, which mission was "to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live."[17][18] In October, 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth’s supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds. The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.[19] In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, NantOmics, to develop cancer drugs based on protein kinase inhibitors. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks’ vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.[20]
In early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs.[21] He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.[22]
In 2010, with Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a "do-tank".[23][self-published source?] HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance.[2][24][dead link]In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service AccuRadio, investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster. [25]In July 2015, Soon-Shiong initiated an IPO for NantKwest (formerly ConkWest) that represented the highest value biotech IPO in history, at a market value of $2.6 billion.[26] In April 2016, the Los Angeles Times reported that Soon-Shiong received a pay package in 2015 from NantKwest worth almost $148 Million, making him one of the highest paid CEOs.[5] Soon-Shiong is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[27][28]

^ Whole pancreas transplantation began as a part of multi-organ transplants, in the mid-to-late 1960s, at the University of Minnesota. See Squifflet, J.P.; Gruessner, R.W. & Sutherland, D.E. (2008). "The History of Pancreas Transplantation: Past, Present and Future". Acta Chir Belg. 108 (3, May-June): 367–378. PMID 18710120. The first attempt to cure type 1 diabetes by pancreas transplantation was done at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on December 17, 1966… [This] opened the door to a period, between the mid-[1970s] to mid-[1980s] where only segmental pancreatic grafts were used... In the late [1970s] – early [1980s], three major events… boosted the development of pancreas transplantation… [At] the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid-[1980s] and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas. During the modern era of immunosuppression, the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion became the gold standard… [for SPK, PAK, PTA]. CS1 maint: Uses authors parameter (link)

Early life and education[edit]
Soon-Shiong was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Chinese immigrant parents who fled from China during the Japanese occupation in World War II.[6][7] His parents were originally from Toisan in Guangdong, China,[7] from among the Hakka people and language group.[6] He graduated from high school at age 16.[8][verification needed]
University and post-graduate training/medicine[edit]
Soon-Shiong studied on scholarship and graduated 4th out of his class of 189 from the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a combined Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh) medical degree at age 23.[8] He completed his medical internship at Johannesburg’s General Hospital.[when?][citation needed] He then studied at the University of British Columbia, where he earned a MSc degree, with research awards from the American College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Association of Academic Surgery (the first resident of the university to do so).[9][dead link] He moved to the United States and began surgical training at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon.[citation needed] Soon-Shiong is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Canada) and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons.[9][dead link][3]Soon-Shiong joined UCLA Medical School in 1983 and served on that faculty until 1991,[3][self-published source?] during which time he was a practicing transplant surgeon.[6] Between 1984 and 1987, he served as an associate investigator at the Center for Ulcer Research and Education.[3][self-published source?] Soon-Shiong performed the first whole-pancreas transplant done at UCLA,[when?][10][11] and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant,[when?] and the "first pig-to-[hu]man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients."[when?][10][better source needed] After a period in industry, he returned to UCLA in 2009,[citation needed] serving as a professor of microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics and bioengineering until this date.[when?][citation needed] Soon-Shiong served as a Visiting Professor at Imperial College, London in 2011.[12][dead link]
Entrepreneurial activities[edit]
In 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm. This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals (APP), of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to Fresenius SE for $4.6 billion in July 2008.[13][dead link] Soon-Shiong later founded Abraxis BioScience (maker of the drug Abraxane he co-discovered),[14] a company he sold to Celgene in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.[15](subscription required)
Soon-Shiong founded NantHealth in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information.[16] Soon-Shiong went on to found NantWorks in September 2011, which mission was "to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live."[17][18] In October, 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth’s supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds. The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.[19] In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, NantOmics, to develop cancer drugs based on protein kinase inhibitors. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks’ vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.[20]
In early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs.[21] He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.[22]
In 2010, with Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a "do-tank".[23][self-published source?] HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance.[2][24][dead link]In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service AccuRadio, investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster. [25]In July 2015, Soon-Shiong initiated an IPO for NantKwest (formerly ConkWest) that represented the highest value biotech IPO in history, at a market value of $2.6 billion.[26] In April 2016, the Los Angeles Times reported that Soon-Shiong received a pay package in 2015 from NantKwest worth almost $148 Million, making him one of the highest paid CEOs.[5] Soon-Shiong is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[27][28]

Early life and education[edit]
Soon-Shiong was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa to Chinese immigrant parents who fled from China during the Japanese occupation in World War II.[6][7] His parents were originally from Toisan in Guangdong, China,[7] from among the Hakka people and language group.[6] He graduated from high school at age 16.[8][verification needed]
University and post-graduate training/medicine[edit]
Soon-Shiong studied on scholarship and graduated 4th out of his class of 189 from the University of Witwatersrand, receiving a combined Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBCh) medical degree at age 23.[8] He completed his medical internship at Johannesburg’s General Hospital.[when?][citation needed] He then studied at the University of British Columbia, where he earned a MSc degree, with research awards from the American College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, and the American Association of Academic Surgery (the first resident of the university to do so).[9][dead link] He moved to the United States and began surgical training at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and became a board-certified surgeon.[citation needed] Soon-Shiong is a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (Canada) and a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons.[9][dead link][3]Soon-Shiong joined UCLA Medical School in 1983 and served on that faculty until 1991,[3][self-published source?] during which time he was a practicing transplant surgeon.[6] Between 1984 and 1987, he served as an associate investigator at the Center for Ulcer Research and Education.[3][self-published source?] Soon-Shiong performed the first whole-pancreas transplant done at UCLA,[when?][10][11] and he developed and first performed the experimental Type 1 diabetes-treatment known as encapsulated-human-islet transplant,[when?] and the "first pig-to-[hu]man islet-cell transplant in diabetic patients."[when?][10][better source needed] After a period in industry, he returned to UCLA in 2009,[citation needed] serving as a professor of microbiology, immunology, molecular genetics and bioengineering until this date.[when?][citation needed] Soon-Shiong served as a Visiting Professor at Imperial College, London in 2011.[12][dead link]
Entrepreneurial activities[edit]
In 1991, Soon-Shiong left UCLA to start a diabetes and cancer biotechnology firm. This led to the founding in 1997 of APP Pharmaceuticals (APP), of which he held 80% of outstanding stock and sold to Fresenius SE for $4.6 billion in July 2008.[13][dead link] Soon-Shiong later founded Abraxis BioScience (maker of the drug Abraxane he co-discovered),[14] a company he sold to Celgene in 2010 in cash-and-stock deal, valued at over $3 billion.[15](subscription required)
Soon-Shiong founded NantHealth in 2007 to provide fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to share healthcare information.[16] Soon-Shiong went on to found NantWorks in September 2011, which mission was "to converge ultra-low power semiconductor technology, supercomputing, high performance, secure advanced networks and augmented intelligence to transform how we work, play, and live."[17][18] In October, 2012, Soon-Shiong announced that NantHealth’s supercomputer-based system and network were able to analyze the genetic data from a tumor sample in 47 seconds and transfer the data in 18 seconds. The goal of developing this infrastructure and digital technologies was to share genomic information among sequencing centers, medical research hubs and hospitals, and to advance cancer research and big science endeavors such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.[19] In January 2013, he founded another biotech company, NantOmics, to develop cancer drugs based on protein kinase inhibitors. NantOmics and its sister company, NantHealth, were subsidiaries of NantWorks. Soon-Shiong stated that NantWorks’ vision for the future of cancer treatment was a convergence of multiple technologies that included diagnostics, supercomputing, network modeling of sharing data on tumor genes and personalized cocktails of cancer drugs in multi-target attacks, to achieve a sustained disease-free state.[20]
In early 2016, Soon-Shiong launched the National Immunotherapy Coalition to encourage rival pharmaceutical companies to work together to test combinations of cancer-fighting drugs.[21] He has also met numerous times with former Vice President Joe Biden to discuss more ambitious approaches to fighting cancer, including conducting genomic sequencing of 100,000 patients to create a massive database of potential genetic factors.[22]
In 2010, with Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, Soon-Shiong founded the Healthcare Transformation Institute (HTI), which he dubs a "do-tank".[23][self-published source?] HTI's mission is to promote a paradigm shift in health care in the United States by better integrating the three now separate domains of medical science, health delivery, and healthcare finance.[2][24][dead link]In 2014, Soon-Shiong funded online streaming music service AccuRadio, investing $2.5 million into the first round of funding for America's fastest-growing music webcaster. [25]In July 2015, Soon-Shiong initiated an IPO for NantKwest (formerly ConkWest) that represented the highest value biotech IPO in history, at a market value of $2.6 billion.[26] In April 2016, the Los Angeles Times reported that Soon-Shiong received a pay package in 2015 from NantKwest worth almost $148 Million, making him one of the highest paid CEOs.[5] Soon-Shiong is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council.[27][28]

^ Whole pancreas transplantation began as a part of multi-organ transplants, in the mid-to-late 1960s, at the University of Minnesota. See Squifflet, J.P.; Gruessner, R.W. & Sutherland, D.E. (2008). "The History of Pancreas Transplantation: Past, Present and Future". Acta Chir Belg. 108 (3, May-June): 367–378. PMID 18710120. The first attempt to cure type 1 diabetes by pancreas transplantation was done at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on December 17, 1966… [This] opened the door to a period, between the mid-[1970s] to mid-[1980s] where only segmental pancreatic grafts were used... In the late [1970s] – early [1980s], three major events… boosted the development of pancreas transplantation… [At] the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid-[1980s] and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas. During the modern era of immunosuppression, the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion became the gold standard… [for SPK, PAK, PTA]. CS1 maint: Uses authors parameter (link)

"The History of Pancreas Transplantation: Past, Present and Future". Acta Chir Belg. 108 (3, May-June): 367–378. PMID 18710120. The first attempt to cure type 1 diabetes by pancreas transplantation was done at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis, on December 17, 1966… [This] opened the door to a period, between the mid-[1970s] to mid-[1980s] where only segmental pancreatic grafts were used... In the late [1970s] – early [1980s], three major events… boosted the development of pancreas transplantation… [At] the Spitzingsee meetings, participants had the idea to renew the urinary drainage technique of the exocrine secretion of the pancreatic graft with segmental graft and eventually with whole pancreaticoduodenal transplant. That was clinically achieved during the mid-[1980s] and remained the mainstay technique during the next decade. In parallel, the Swedish group developed the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion. It was the onset of the whole pancreas reign. The enthusiasm for the technique was rather moderated in its early phase due to the rapid development of liver transplantation and the need for sharing vascular structures between both organs, liver and pancreas. During the modern era of immunosuppression, the whole pancreas transplantation technique with enteric diversion became the gold standard… [for SPK, PAK, PTA]. CS1 maint: Uses authors parameter (link)

Verizon invests in NantHealth to deliver mobile clinical dataBy Neil VerselOctober 24, 2012

Share






 
NantHealth, a subsidiary of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong's NantWorks, has received an unspecified equity investment from Verizon Communications, through the telecom's Verizon Investment arm. Verizon will help NantHealth develop a secure fiber-optic, cloud-based data infrastructure to deliver multimedia healthcare information to mobile devices, according to the companies.
"If we can stream a movie into a smartphone today, why can't we do an X-ray or CAT scan result?" Soon-Shiong said to the Los Angeles Business Journal.
This kind of content is supposed to help clinicians provide better care. "We believe that evidence-based medicine will be the cornerstone of future healthcare delivery," Soon-Shiong added in a joint press release. "Partnering with Verizon gives us the national scale to succeed in enhancing patient outcomes and better access to care through secure broadband networks and our mobile platform."
Soon-Shiong, who placed 47th on this year's Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people with an estimated net worth of $7.3 billion, also told the L.A. Business Journal that Verizon will help NantHealth develop "smart home" technology for remotely monitoring patients away from traditional healthcare settings.
Verizon and NantWorks already collaborate on the Cancer Knowledge Action Network, which provides clinicians with mobile access to cancer treatment protocols, and a supercomputing platform that reportedly can analyze a cancer patient's genomic data in less than a minute.
Earlier this year, another Soon-Shiong company, NantPharma, received a $125 million injection of capital from investment firm Blackstone.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

I like to look for patterns in science and life. It's what I do.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Life,
Science,
Look



















If you look upon chronic diseases as an epidemic, and you see that the chronically ill are the poor, then you see that this issue of the uninsured is not really a moral but a financial obligation to change health care.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Change,
Health,

There is no right or wrong way of giving. People in Los Angeles have made major contributions in different ways to the city: Eli Broad to art. David Geffen to hospitals. I'm not judgmental.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Art,
City,
Giving



















The idea would be in my mind - and I know it sounds strange - is that the most important advances in medicine would be made not by new knowledge in molecular biology, because that's exceeding what we can even use. It'll be made by mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, figuring out a way to get all that information together.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Knowledge,
Together,
Mind



















Yes, iD is a machine vision and sensor browser for the physical world. That's what we have been working on with Coca-Cola, Verizon, Bank of America and Disney to launch content when an image is recognised.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Vision,
World,
America



















I am convinced that in order for you, as a patient, to be protected, it has to be transparent, evidence-based, objective information. Not self-serving information. Not pharma-driven information. Not ad-driven information. It is transparent, objective, evidence-based information.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


I Am,
Information,
You



















You'd believe that a patient with hypertension, if you know you have hypertension or diabetes, you would take your drug every day. The compliance rate is more like 30% or 40%. Which means that 60% of patients don't take their drugs, and they actually go into these crises, end up in the hospital.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Day,
End,
Believe



















I want to do transformational work to actually fix the world.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Work,
World,
Want



















I'm a physician. I've been blessed with ideas and resources to use technology to make the world a better place. That's what I would like to leave behind.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Technology,
Blessed,

The foundations and the intent of the Affordable Care Act are laudable. The way it's being implemented is a disaster.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Care,

Act



















The pancreas is by far the most complex organ in the body.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Body,

Complex



















I have an obligation to use what I know to try to bring real, usable medical science to every doctor and bedside and patient.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Science,
Medical,
Doctor



















We need to and must protect privacy. But I think that people will be willing and even eager to share medical information about themselves for the greater good of mankind.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Good,
Medical,
Information



















In South Africa, being Chinese meant I wasn't white and I wasn't black. I trained in Baragwanath Hospital, the largest black hospital in South Africa. That was around 1976, the time of the Soweto Uprising, when police fired on children and students who were protesting. I was part of the group of interns who volunteered to treat them.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Time,
Children,
Black



















I think of L.A. as truly the melting pot. It's basically a mini-country unto itself.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Think,

Pot
























It's unconscionable that cancer patients get the wrong diagnosis 30 percent of the time and that it takes so long to treat them with appropriate drugs for their cancer.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Time,
Treat,
Long



















My commitment is to Los Angeles, so whatever helps this continue to be a great city, that's what I would be focused to do, and the Dodgers are certainly iconic to Los Angeles.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Great,
Commitment,
City



















It took 23 years from Abraxane being conceived to us showing now with conclusiveness that it works in pancreatic cancer. We cannot afford as a society to wait another 23 years to make sure that the patients get the right care, at the right time, at the right place.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Time,
Society,
Care



















What we discovered, counter-intuitively, is that when you start killing a cancer cell, one of the things it does in order to survive is to spread even further. It causes itself to form new blood vessels. We've termed this 'reactionary angiogenesis.'
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Start,
You,
Blood



















We're really going after truly creating sustainability of a disease-free state, creating a complete system for managing cancer patients for life, so that you can manage from onset of disease all the way through.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Life,
You,
Sustainability



















You don't inherit cancer; you actually get it.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


You,
Cancer,
Inherit



















It was really an easy decision for me to be a part of the Lakers. It's priceless. It is one of the few places where I truly get lost in the joy of the moment of that game. All of the stresses and all the responsibilities are gone.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Joy,
Moment,
Lost
























I'm truly passionate about basketball. I'm not as passionate about baseball as I am about basketball, but I watch baseball and I watch football. I love sports in general.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Love,
Sports,
Baseball



















Baseball is like cricket, and I grew up in a country where they had cricket. So I understand cricket, soccer and basketball. I played basketball at the club level and a little bit in college, so that's why I'm a basketball fanatic.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Baseball,
College,
Why



















We need to think of chronic disease, hypertension, cancer, like H1N1. In fact, there's an epidemic of chronic disease.
Patrick Soon-Shiong


Think,
Cancer,
Need



















I love doing a lot of things I'm told I can't do. I think that's what drives me and keeps me awake every day.
Patrick Soon-Shiong
