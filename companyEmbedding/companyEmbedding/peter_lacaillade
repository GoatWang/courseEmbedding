Certified Oil Company aligns with The Nexxus Group

DANVERS, Massachusetts (March 4) – The Certified Oil Company, based in Columbus, OH, is the latest company to partner with The Nexxus Group, an industry-leading Scan Based Trading solutions provider.
The Nexxus Group will employ its proprietary Scan Based Trading tools to manage newspaper sales for 81 branded Certified Oil Company convenience store locations in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. The program takes effect Monday, June 9.
Carlyle Baker opened the first Certified Gasoline Station in 1939 in Piqua, OH. The company grew steadily, meeting the country’s burgeoning post-War transportation appetite, weathering the oil crisis of the 1970s, and evolving and adapting yet again to meet changing consumer lifestyles and the demand for one-stop shopping convenience.
As Certified celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, business practices established by Mr. Baker remain the cornerstone of the company’s success. Throughout this milestone year, customers will be treated with in-store specials and giveaways. The company will continue a long-standing tradition of giving back by continuing to support community projects and events.
The company today is under the direction of President/CEO Peter Lacaillade, Mr. Baker’s son-in-law and COO Keith Cheney and has spent $30million upgrading technology in recent years. The family legacy has extended to a third generation as Mr. Baker’s grandson, Nicholas Lacaillade, came on board in 2013 as the Director of Corporate Development.
“We are very excited about the efficiencies that our program will bring to Certified Oil,” says Mark Landgren, CEO of Nexxus Group. “We look forward to working with such a growth-minded company with such a long and storied history and commitment to the community.”
In addition to its convenience stores, Certified Oil operates or supplies more than 140 fuel locations, maintaining its proprietary brand as well as branding and distributing fuels for Marathon, Sunoco and Valero.

History



Fueling the Midwest since 1939 




In 1939, Carlyle Baker opened the first Certified Gasoline Station in Piqua, Ohio.  The station sold gasoline and offered limited automobile repair to the motoring public.  During the next thirty-five years as the demand for gasoline stations grew so did Certified, reaching a pinnacle of more than three hundred locations throughout the Midwest. Mr. Baker cultivated his vision of expansion through the hiring of Mr. Dean Walcutt who initially operated the second Certified gasoline station located in Columbus, Ohio.  Mr. Walcutt ultimately became President of Certified and served in that position with distinction for five decades, until his passing in 1995. Mr. Baker named the company Certified because of his firm belief of providing “certifiable” quality products and a pleasant shopping experience for all customers.  Long before today’s rewards programs, Certified offered its customers a free gift with the purchase of gasoline.  For many years Certified customers received free items such as laundry baskets, flowers, golf balls, American flags, glassware and Easter chickens for children, setting the standards for rewarding loyal Certified customers. The gasoline crisis of the 1970’s resulted in the closure of many gasoline stations across America and a number of competitors went out of business.  Through the vision, guidance and steadiness of Mr. Baker, Certified was able to weather the storm and remain a strong and viable marketer of gasoline in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. The decade of the 1980’s presented a new challenge to gasoline stations when consumer lifestyles demanded one-stop shopping for gasoline, convenience products and snack foods.  Once again Certified was able to adapt, with the result becoming the present day Certified Convenience Stores. As the founder of Certified, Mr. Baker, set forth the foundation of business practices that still serve as the pillars of principles for Certified Convenience Stores today.  Assuring Certified customers receive quality products and a pleasant shopping experience, and treating both customers and employees as valued members of the Certified family. Mr. Baker passed away in 1998 but his legacy lives on through his family.  Mr. Baker’s son-in-law, Peter Lacaillade, took over the company’s helm in 1998 and continues today serving as President/CEO. In 2013, Nicholas Lacaillade, a third generation family member, joined Certified as VP of Retail and Corporate Development.  Focusing on the company’s core competencies and infusing significant capital provides today’s Certified customers with modern retail facilities, innovative products and great customer service.  Using today’s technology, our Certified Rewards Program is designed to thank our valuable customers the way Mr. Baker did in the past.  Stop in and grab a cup of our great coffee, Carlyle’s Cup, a premium brew in honor of the man who made Certified a household name in Columbus, Ohio and throughout the Midwest.
