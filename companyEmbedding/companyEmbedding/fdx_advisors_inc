Modern technology to optimize advisor productivity and minimize program administration
Governance to ensure the UMA program and associated managers are delivering to expectations
Flexibility to incorporate your own unique value proposition

Basic features of the FDx Advisors UMA program include:

Access to multiple asset allocations
Prescreened investment products that include separate accounts, mutual funds, and ETFs to fund each asset class in a single convenient account
Streamlined registration paperwork
Flexibility to customize asset allocations for accounts from $50K and up

Differentiating features of the FDx Advisors UMA program include:

The ability to select from a broad range of UMA program capabilities
Optional overlay management
Two-way due diligence of money managers and model performance
Active governance to ensure your UMA program is delivering to expectations and that information from money managers is timely and accurate
Active monitoring and resolution of errors
The ability to configure your UMA programs to meet the unique needs of your firm
Turnkey solutions to get you up and running quickly
