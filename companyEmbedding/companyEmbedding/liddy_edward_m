Early life[edit]
Born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Liddy was educated at the Trinity-Pawling School for Boys (Founder's League), located on the hills overlooking Pawling, New York. He graduated high school in 1964 from the Clearwater Central Catholic High School, along with its first graduating class of 27 students. At the time, he and his mother lived near downtown Clearwater, Florida. He holds a B. A. degree from The Catholic University of America (1968)[1] and holds an MBA from George Washington University (1972).
Career[edit]
Liddy worked for Ford Motor Company until 1981 when he joined Searle. From 1986 to 1988. Liddy was executive vice president of ADT, Inc.[2] In 1988 he moved to Sears[3] and then in 1994 to Allstate where he was chief operating officer until 1999 and chairman, chief executive officer and president until 2005.[2]
Liddy was on the board of Goldman Sachs from 2003 to 2008, when he resigned to become CEO of AIG.[4] He was selected by Henry Paulson for both roles.[5]
AIG[edit]
Liddy became CEO of AIG in September 2008, succeeding Robert B. Willumstad.[6] As CEO of AIG, Liddy received a salary of just $1,[7][8][9][10] but also received $460,000 to cover "housing, travel, taxes and legal fees".[11]
Liddy garnered national headlines in October 2008 for defending a controversial $440,000 AIG retreat for top-performing insurance salesmen at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California. The retreat, which was held shortly after the U.S. government rescued AIG from insolvency with $84 billion in loans, included $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa. In testimony before the U.S. House Oversight Committee, Liddy stated that such retreats "are standard practice in our industry."[12] During the U.S. presidential debate on October 7, 2008, Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama mentioned the retreat and said, "The Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired."[13]
In light of the AIG bonus payments controversy, Liddy urged employees to return $165m issued in bonuses to them,[14] suggesting doing the "right thing"[15] and returning at least part of the bonus is preferable to legal action, noting “honoring contractual commitments is at the heart of what we do in the insurance business.”[16] While Liddy called the bonuses “distasteful” in an appearance in the House of Representatives,[17] it later transpired that Liddy had accelerated more than a quarter of AIG Financial Products bonuses by three months, which Jake DeSantis described as “hardly something that one would do if he truly found the contracts ‘distasteful’.”[18]
Liddy owned 27,129 shares in Goldman Sachs, at the time worth just over $3 million.[19] In April 2009 members of Congress called for Liddy to sell these shares, as they created a conflict of interest due to Goldman Sachs' receipt of bailout money.[20]
Liddy announced on May 21, 2009 that he would resign as AIG Chairman and CEO when replacements were found, suggesting that the two roles be split.[21] In August 2009, Robert Benmosche took over as CEO and Harvey Golub as chairman.[22]
After AIG[edit]
As of September 13, 2011, Liddy is on the board of directors for 3M[23] and Boeing.[24] He is chairman of ServiceMaster[25] and a partner of private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.[26][27]

Liddy oversaw the spin-off of Allstate from Sears and was named chief operating officer (COO) of the newly public firm, Allstate Insurance Co., in 1994. He remained at Allstate as COO (1994–98), president (1995–2005), CEO (1999–2006), and chairman of the board (1999–2008) of parent company Allstate Corp. He reengineered the company by laying off much of its sales force and implementing Web-based customer service and sales. Liddy retired from Allstate in April 2008, but he continued to serve on some of the country’s most prestigious corporate boards, including 3M, Boeing, and Goldman Sachs.In September 2008, as the global financial crisis that came to be often called the Great Recession was taking hold, Liddy was appointed CEO of AIG (at an annual salary of $1) as the insurance company was facing trillions of dollars in losses. Deemed “too big to fail,” AIG had received an estimated $170 billion in federal bailout funds and was required by the U.S. government to sell, barter, and broker its way out of its failures. To this end, Liddy sold several businesses as well as stakes in some units. His work also involved managing—and speaking to—the firm’s past failures. In August 2009 he retired from AIG.Sarah Forbes OrwigThe Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica

Edward M. Liddy



Edward M. Liddy is the former CEO of American International Group (AIG). He retired on August 10, 2009.  He succeeded Robert B. Willumstad.
Liddy was installed as AIG’s chief executive when the government effectively nationalized the company in the fall of 2008. He was paid $1 a year.[1]  He left partly because of a barrage of criticism from lawmakers and regulators over AIG's use of billions of dollars of taxpayers' money.[2]
AIG executive vice president in AIG's financial products unit, Jake Desantis, rendered his resignation letter to Liddy on March 24, 2009 in a letter published in The New York Times.[3]
Also in early March of 2009, AIG founder, Hank Greenberg, launched two separate salvos against his former company, accusing it of cheating him out of a fortune and blasting Liddy for trying to lay some of the blame for AIG's woes at Greenberg's feet. Greenberg sued AIG in Manhattan federal court, claiming execs at the insurer kept shares "artificially inflated" by lying about the company's exposure to subprime mortgages. He claimed those "material omissions and misrepresentations" killed the value of 3.7 million shares of AIG stock he got under a deferred-compensation package in January 2008. The lawsuit didn't specify damages, but demanded the $70 million in taxes he paid on the $200 million in stock.[4]

Background
Liddy spent several years as CEO of Allstate Insurance, a domestic automobile and home insurance company.[5]

The following is a letter sent on Tuesday by Jake DeSantis, an executive vice president of the American International Group’s financial products unit, to Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of A.I.G.DEAR Mr. Liddy,It is with deep regret that I submit my notice of resignation from A.I.G. Financial Products. I hope you take the time to read this entire letter. Before describing the details of my decision, I want to offer some context:I am proud of everything I have done for the commodity and equity divisions of A.I.G.-F.P. I was in no way involved in — or responsible for — the credit default swap transactions that have hamstrung A.I.G. Nor were more than a handful of the 400 current employees of A.I.G.-F.P. Most of those responsible have left the company and have conspicuously escaped the public outrage.After 12 months of hard work dismantling the company — during which A.I.G. reassured us many times we would be rewarded in March  2009 — we in the financial products unit have been betrayed by A.I.G. and are being unfairly persecuted by elected officials. In response to this, I will now leave the company and donate my entire post-tax retention payment to those  suffering from the global economic downturn. My intent is to keep none of the money myself.I take this action after 11 years of dedicated, honorable service to A.I.G. I can no longer effectively perform my duties in this dysfunctional environment, nor am I being paid to do so. Like you, I was asked to work for an annual salary of $1, and I agreed out of a sense of duty to the company and to the public officials who have come to its aid. Having now been let down by both, I can no longer justify spending 10, 12, 14 hours a day away from my family for the benefit of those who have let me down.

You and I have never met or spoken to each other, so I’d like to tell you about myself. I was raised by schoolteachers working multiple jobs in a world of closing steel mills. My hard work earned me acceptance to M.I.T., and the institute’s generous financial aid enabled me to attend. I had fulfilled my American dream. Continue reading the main story

I started at this company in 1998 as an equity trader, became the head of equity and commodity trading and, a couple of years before  A.I.G.’s meltdown last September, was named the head of business development for commodities. Over this period the equity and commodity units were consistently profitable — in most years generating net profits of well over $100 million. Most recently, during the dismantling of A.I.G.-F.P., I was an integral player in the pending sale of its well-regarded commodity index business to UBS. As you know, business unit sales like this are crucial to A.I.G.’s effort to repay the American taxpayer.The profitability of the businesses with which I was associated clearly supported my compensation. I never received any pay resulting from the  credit default swaps that are now losing so much money. I did, however, like many others here, lose a significant portion of my life savings in the form of deferred compensation invested in the capital of A.I.G.-F.P. because of those  losses. In this way I have personally suffered from this controversial activity — directly as well as indirectly with the rest of the taxpayers.I have the utmost respect for the civic duty that you are now performing at A.I.G. You are as blameless for these credit default swap losses as I am. You answered your country’s call  and you are taking a tremendous beating for it.But you also are aware that most of the employees of your financial products unit had nothing to do with the large losses. And I am disappointed and frustrated over your lack of support for us. I and many others in the unit feel betrayed that you failed to stand up for us in the face of untrue and unfair accusations from certain members of Congress last Wednesday and from the press over our retention payments, and that you didn’t defend us against the baseless and reckless comments made by the attorneys general of New York and Connecticut.My guess is that in October, when you learned of these retention contracts, you realized that the employees of the financial products unit needed some incentive to stay and that the contracts, being both ethical and useful, should be left to stand. That’s probably why A.I.G. management  assured us on three occasions during that month that the company would “live up to its commitment” to honor the contract guarantees.That may be why you decided to accelerate by three months more than a quarter of the amounts due under the contracts. That action signified to us your support, and was hardly something that one would do if he truly found the contracts “distasteful.”That may also be why you authorized the balance of the payments on March 13.At no time during the past six months that you have been leading A.I.G. did you ask us to revise, renegotiate or break these contracts — until several hours before your appearance last week before Congress.

I think your initial decision to honor the contracts was both ethical and financially astute, but it seems to have been politically unwise. It’s now apparent that you either misunderstood the agreements that you had made — tacit or otherwise — with the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, various members of Congress and  Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York, or were not strong enough to withstand the shifting political winds.

You’ve now asked the current employees of A.I.G.-F.P. to repay these earnings. As you can imagine, there has been a tremendous amount of serious thought and heated discussion about how we should respond to this breach of trust.As most of us have done nothing wrong, guilt is not a motivation to surrender our earnings. We have worked 12 long months under these contracts and now deserve to be paid as promised. None of us should be cheated of our payments  any more than a plumber should be cheated  after he has fixed the pipes but a careless electrician causes a fire that burns down the house.Many of the employees have, in the past six months, turned down job offers from more stable employers, based on A.I.G.’s assurances that the contracts would be honored. They are now angry about having been misled by A.I.G.’s promises and are not inclined to return the money as a favor to you.The only real motivation that anyone at A.I.G.-F.P. now has is fear. Mr. Cuomo has threatened to “name and shame,” and his counterpart in Connecticut,  Richard Blumenthal, has made similar threats — even though attorneys general are supposed to stand for due process, to conduct trials in courts and not the press.So what am I to do? There’s no easy answer. I know that because of hard work I have benefited more than most during the economic boom and have saved enough that my family is unlikely to suffer devastating losses during the current bust. Some might argue that members of my profession have been overpaid, and I wouldn’t disagree.That is why I have decided to donate 100 percent of the effective after-tax proceeds of my retention payment directly to organizations that are helping people who are suffering from the global downturn. This is not a tax-deduction gimmick; I simply believe that I at least deserve to dictate how my earnings are spent, and do not want to see them disappear back into the obscurity of A.I.G.’s or the federal government’s budget. Our earnings have caused such a distraction for so many from the more pressing issues our country faces, and I would like to see my share of it  benefit those truly in need.On  March 16 I received a payment from A.I.G. amounting to $742,006.40, after taxes. In light of the uncertainty over the ultimate taxation and legal status of this payment, the actual amount I donate may be less — in fact, it may end up being far less if the recent House bill raising the tax on the retention payments to 90 percent stands. Once all the money is donated, you will immediately receive a list of all recipients.This choice is right for me. I wish others at A.I.G.-F.P. luck finding peace with their difficult decision, and only hope their judgment is not clouded by fear.

Mr. Liddy, I wish you success in your commitment to return the money extended by the American government, and luck with the continued unwinding of the company’s diverse businesses — especially those remaining credit default swaps. I’ll continue over the short term to help make sure no balls are dropped, but after what’s happened this past week I can’t remain much longer — there is too much bad blood. I’m not sure how you will greet my resignation, but at least Attorney General Blumenthal should be relieved that I’ll leave under my own power and will not need to be “shoved out the door.”
