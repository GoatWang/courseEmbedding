Pirch, Inc. Key Developments

PIRCH Opens Its Tenth Location in Austin, Texas
May 18 17
PIRCH officially opens its concept in Austin, Texas on May 18, 2017. This location is the tenth PIRCH showroom in the United States. The company will be the first showroom in Austin where architects, interior designers, builders and design-loving home owners can discover, explore, and "test-drive" a carefully curated collection of premier appliance brands from around the globe in one interactive environment. Imagine a kitchen, bath, laundry and outdoor showroom where showers and faucets actually run water, and a kitchen with a working range might have cookies baking or the rotisserie turning. The company welcomed both the trade and homeowners planning construction, a remodel, or new ideas to transform their homes. Brands leading innovations in kitchen technology are showcased for clients to experience design trends and see new developments from top vendors. Each PIRCH showroom promises guests an elevated experience that will educate and inform, whether shopping for a single appliance or seeking inspiration for a complete renovation.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Our Story.


Imagine the power to change the way people live, forever.
“We certainly deserve more,” we said to ourselves. After all, this is our life journey. And yet, along the way, an industry that adorns our kitchens with expensive appliances, the shower that starts our day, and the grill that completes our weekend, has been allowed to operate with such indifference—dimly lit spaces, dusty boxes, and thoughtless human interaction. The current state of affairs was broken. Lost.  Dated. It was never forced to evolve. So it didn't. We simply had to live with unguided choices, no chance to try it before we were told to pay, and a 1-800 number to nowhere.
It could be done better. It could be done beautifully. And so began PIRCH.

The PIRCH Manifesto (1 of 5)










CEO Jeffrey Sear’s at the PIRCH Paramus Showroom Opening (2 of 5)










Entryway to PIRCH Support Center (3 of 5)










PIRCH Team Members Enjoying San Diego (4 of 5)










Celebrating the PIRCH Dallas Showroom Opening (5 of 5)








From the beginning, PIRCH has operated with a defiant attitude and audacious objective: To focus on people and life’s precious few moments, rather than stainless steel and porcelain. We wanted inspiration, education and accountability. Our homes serve as the backdrop that connects us to family, kindle our friendships, and create permanence within our community. This is a truth universally acknowledged. As for PIRCH, we are neither retail zealots nor big company movers. Like you, we are fathers, mothers, friends, wives, brothers, builders, cyclists, wannabe chefs, animal lovers, creators, travelers and at least one cheese head.
 
Having just lived through a brief time in history ominously called The Great Recession, we were all given a chance to look back on the senseless acquisition of “things” that slick marketers promised would bring us great happiness and a life fulfilled. They did not. We realized that there was a simple truth missing: Moments.
 
Those moments might take the form of a candle-lit bubble bath celebrating an anniversary.  Or game-day burgers with lifetime friends. Or perhaps, the world’s best mac & cheese, created by a father for his three little girls without a recipe, who will remember that moment for the rest of their lives.
It’s not complicated. Moments are everything. They possess the authority to deliver us joy. We believe this truth so deeply that we wrote a manifesto to guide our actions everyday. You will find it best defines what matters to us. To make moments count. Take a look. You can download our Elements of Joy Manifesto here.

Read Full Story




PIRCH was founded on the idea that creating joyful experiences is more powerful than simply handling business transactions.  Our Manifesto  is our guide and bringing it to life requires exceptional kindness, incredible focus and tireless effort—and we wouldn't have it any other way.
At PIRCH, you will be surrounded by great people who also happen to be talented professionals. From showroom floor to installation, all of our teams are working to do the seemingly impossible—make appliance and plumbing shopping fun and worry-free. At the same time, we are building a culture we can be proud of and a workplace that honors each individual's contribution. We'll be honest—we always are—this is hard work, and should you join the organization you are making an implicit commitment to be accountable for awesome results and how they are achieved.
The good news; hard work pays off, especially here. Your journey with PIRCH will be filled with great opportunity and being a part of a growing company and luxury retail brand means there are endless possibilities when it comes to what you can learn, where you can go, and who you can become.
While our showrooms, distribution centers and support center all offer unique work environments, the way we work, the opportunity, and the joy remain the same.
Are you ready to make the best decision of your professional career? We thought so… please explore our available positions across the country below. We are eagerly awaiting to hear from you.
