Anne Arvia resigns as CEO of ShoreBank


(Crain's) -- Anne L. Arvia is leaving her job as CEO of Chicago-based ShoreBank to become president and CEO of a bank launched three months ago by Columbus, Ohio-based insurer Nationwide Financial Services Inc.
Ms. Arvia, 43, will take over leadership of Nationwide Bank and move to Columbus.
One of Chicago's highest ranking female bankers, her departure from ShoreBank, effective next month, is a blow to the nationally prominent community development bank, which made its reputation lending to apartment rehabbers in low-income communities on the South and West sides.
A 15-year ShoreBank veteran and an accountant by trade, Ms. Arvia became president of ShoreBank's Chicago operation in 2001 and CEO of the entire bank in 2003. ShoreBank has increased net income from $10 million in 2001 to $14 million last year. Assets have grown in that time frame to $1.8 billion from $1.1 billion.
Ms. Arvia has been instrumental in focusing ShoreBank on profitable business lines and shedding unprofitable ones. Under her leadership, the bank exited auto lending and focused on areas of strength like lending to apartment owners and churches.
Just recently, Ms. Arvia engineered ShoreBank's first acquisition in a decade, agreeing to buy Greater Chicago Bank of west suburban Bellwood for $15 million.
Mary Houghton, 65, a co-founder of ShoreBank and currently president of holding company ShoreBank Corp., will assume Ms. Arvia's bank duties on an interim basis. The bank plans to launch a search for candidates.
"The board of directors and the management are saddened by Anne's decision, but recognize that her new position presents an outstanding opportunity for her to broaden her professional and personal experiences," said an internal memo from ShoreBank chairman and co-founder Ron Grzywinski.
Observers expect the bank to find a replacement from outside its ranks. Finding the right person could be a challenge given ShoreBank's unique community development culture. For years, much of the bank's profits have been plowed into environmental projects and community development loans in communities all over the country and countries as far away as Afghanistan.
For ShoreBank, choices will have to be made about future direction, Ms. Arvia said. With profit margins from lending narrowing, the bank is looking for ways to increase its fee income. It will look for new markets to enter. The Bellwood acquisition, which is expected to close in September, is a good example of a first step. That was ShoreBank's first foray into the Chicago suburbs.At Nationwide, Ms. Arvia said she will have free rein to determine how the new Nationwide Bank is run.
Options range from selling bank products through Nationwide's agents or the Internet to building retail branches in certain markets.
"It's truly a clean state at this point," she said.
She also wanted to try her skills at a bigger company. Nationwide had revenue of $4.3 billion last year and has a market capitalization of $6.6 billion.
While her salary will grow, that wasn't the key to her decision, she said. "It's not the driver, I can honestly say that," she said.
The timing is also right to move, she said, with her children not yet in high school.
