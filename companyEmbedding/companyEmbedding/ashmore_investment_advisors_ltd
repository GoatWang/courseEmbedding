What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.

“The difference is approach”









Questions to ask yourself.
Whether you’re starting with a list of recommended advisors or you have a specific advisor in mind, starting with the three questions located in the tabs below can help you make a thoughtful choice.



What are my goals and preferences?
Consider these Factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:

Investment Goals – What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
Risk Tolerance – How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
Time Horizon – When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
Income Needs – Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?
Tax Situation – Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
Other Holdings – Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
Other Needs – Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?



What investment services do I need?

Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

Portfolio design
Discretionary portfolio management
Ongoing investment advice



Cash management

Planning

Business succession
Charitable giving

What is my preferred communication style?
You should also consider the nature of the client relationship that you would like with an investment advisor, including the frequency, level, and form of communication you would like to maintain with the advisor. How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?

Interview questions to ask advisors.
As you begin to talk with advisors, you’ll want to evaluate them objectively. Asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison. 





What are your credentials?




An advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise.


CFP® (Certified Financial Planner™)
CFP professionals have completed university-level financial planning coursework and passed a 10-hour exam covering nearly 90 topics, from group medical insurance to derivatives.
                          More information >



CFA® (Chartered Financial Analyst®)
CFAs must pass three exams, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements.
                          More information >



PFS (Personal Financial Specialist)
Personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning. The credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise.
                          More information >



CIMA® (Certified Investment Management Analyst®)
CIMAs focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, or at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
                          More information >



Suggestion - Visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification.
Common credentials - This is not a complete list of certifications. There is no implied endorsement of one certification over another. Professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.






Do you offer the services I need?




Investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide. In general, they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below.


Money managers
If you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing, consider money managers. They:

Design investment portfolios, generally consisting of stocks, bonds, and other individual securities.
Often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis, meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you.
May not offer general financial planning services.



Financial planners
If you need someone to review your situation and help with big-picture planning, consider financial planners. They:

Help you look to the future and do long-term financial planning in the areas of retirement, college funding, wealth transfer, tax planning, and insurance.
May not offer investing and portfolio management services.



Wealth managers
If you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs, consider wealth managers. They:

Provide highly personalized, comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for high-net-worth clients.
Coordinate with other professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, to serve more complex financial needs, which may include tax minimization, trust management, wealth transfers, real estate management, and portfolio performance analytics.









How are you compensated?




Knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive. Independent advisors generally work on a fee-only or fee-plus-commissions basis.
Types of compensation and what they mean to you:


Fee only
Asset-based, hourly, or flat fees: Many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you (typically 1%–2%). This compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. Hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific, one-time service (e.g., developing a financial plan). The fee may vary by account size and service. In addition to these fees, you may pay commissions and/or other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets.


Fee plus commissions
Along with an advisory or financial planning fee, some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends, such as insurance policies or annuities.


Commissions only
Advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you.


Wrap fees
Sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee, which is typically a single asset-based fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make.








How will we work together?




Good communication between you and your advisor is essential. Asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect.
What to ask:


With whom will I work?
In some cases, the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it. If personal rapport is important to you, ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with.


How often will we communicate?
Regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Typically, your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email.


How will you report performance?
At a minimum, you should expect to receive:

Account statements from the advisor or custodian/brokerage firm where your assets are held.
Quarterly summaries of year-to-date investment performance.
A comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor.



What is the size of your firm?
A firm’s size – including the number of employees, the assets under management, and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive.

Large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services. Small firms may offer more personalized attention.
The average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm.









How do you approach investing for people like me?




Things to consider:


Performance

Ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets1.
Ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&P 500® Index2, during the same time period.
An advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark.



Investment style

Advisors may specialize in certain types of investments (such as mutual funds, stocks, or bonds) and styles (such as growth or value).
You can assess whether the advisor's methodology or style aligns with your objectives.
Asking about an advisor's investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand.



Decision-making

Advisors who have a disciplined approach to decision-making may be more likely to stay focused on your long-term goals.
Many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time. Your strategy should be based on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk.
Knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic, long-term approach or invests in short-term trends.




1Past performance does not guarantee future results.
2The S&P 500® Index is an index of widely traded stocks. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.







Where will my assets be held?




Independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks, mutual funds, and other assets.
Why should you ask this question?
You want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets.

Look for a custodian with important services, such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements, which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio.

Ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity.










Preliminary screening.




You can review pertinent information about an advisor even before you meet
All independent advisors are required to publicly disclose details about their business by filing a Form ADV. You can review the Form ADVs on the SEC website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Find a local advisor


Form ADV, Part 1 describes the advisor’s business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary history.
Form ADV, Part 2 is a narrative brochure that describes in plain English the advisor’s services, fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel. Advisors are required to give you this information before you hire them.

“Get acquainted with independent financial advisors”



Independent Financial Advisors
Understanding fiduciary.
As fiduciaries regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, independent registered investment advisors are held by law to the highest standard of responsibility to their clients, therefore upholding them to always act in their clients’ best interests. This encourages a unique level of personalized service not always found in investor-advisor relationships.






Key benefits of independent registered investment advisors.



Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture
Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. So whether you need help with retirement planning, a tax situation, estate planning, or managing assets at multiple places, independent advisors have the freedom to choose from a wide range of investment options in order to tailor their advice based on what’s best for you.




A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal
To offer advice closely aligned with your goals, independent advisors must first build a strong understanding of your situation. As a result, many independent advisors focus on building deep relationships with their clients. This often takes regular, ongoing interactions. And because many of these advisors are entrepreneurial business owners, they hold themselves personally accountable to their clients.




A fee structure that is simple and transparent
Independent advisors typically charge a fee based on a percentage of assets managed. This fee structure is simple, transparent, and easy to understand. It also gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. When you succeed, your advisor succeeds.




A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs
Independent advisors can help investors address the variety of complex investment needs that arise when you accumulate significant wealth. While specific services vary from firm to firm, they are often described as financial “quarterbacks” focused on your holistic financial picture. Some advisors are specialists in certain investment strategies. Others can assist you with comprehensive services, such as estate planning or borrowing, the sale of a business, complicated tax situations, trusts, and intergenerational wealth transfer.




Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.
Independent advisors use independent custodians, such as Charles Schwab and others, to hold and safeguard clients’ assets. For many investors, this provides a reassuring system of checks and balances – your money is not held by the same person who advises you about how to invest it.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

About ETFs:
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a more diversified investment that trades like a stock but pools the money of many investors to purchase a group of assets such as stocks, bonds, foreign currency or commodities. Some of the most popular
                ETFs offer a type of index investment, where the manager seeks to track the performance of a specific index such as the Dow Jones or S&P 500. There are a few types of high risk ETFs such as leveraged and inverse which are short-term,
                higher-risk investments that should only be implemented by experienced traders.

A bond is a form of debt security in which an investor lends money to an entity in return for interest. The bond acts as an IOU — once it matures, the bond issuer pays you back the money, plus interest.
Each bond has unique characteristics that investors need to understand prior to purchase. Generally, the higher the interest rate, the riskier the investment.

                trading doesn’t take place on one of the formal exchanges. Keep in mind that forex trading involves significant risk and is not suitable for all investors.

Can I transfer my account from another broker?



Yes. You can fund your Ally Invest account by transferring assets from another brokerage firm.
You'll need to submit an asset transfer request form (ACAT form).
We'll also need a recent statement for the account that you want to transfer. You can fax the documents to us at 1-855-880-25591-855-880-2559, or you can send them by mail to one of the following addresses:
Ally Invest Securities

P.O. Box 49050

Charlotte, NC 28277-3432
For overnight deliveries, mail to:
Ally Invest Securities

11605 N Community House Rd

Third Floor

Charlotte, NC 28277
Account transfers normally complete in 5 to 7 business days. Keep in mind, the account at the other broker and account you have with us must be the same kind (such as individual, joint or IRA).
After an account transfer processes, some assets may remain in the account at the carrying firm. This is quite common, for example, with interests that were not yet in the account at the carrying firm when the transfer completed. To make sure your transfer is complete, our clearing firm performs automatic residual sweeps every 2 weeks to transfer what might have not transferred the first time around.
We do not charge for incoming ACAT account transfers. There may be a fee for other types of transfers.

How are my accounts protected?



Ally Invest Securities, LLC, is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides protection for accounts up to $500,000 (including $250,000 for claims of cash) per client as defined by SIPC rules. Visit http://www.sipc.org/for-investors/what-sipc-protects for more information or call 1-202-371-8300.
Our clearing firm, Apex Clearing, has also purchased an additional insurance policy through a group of London Underwriters (with Lloyd's of London Syndicates as the Lead Underwriter) to supplement SIPC protection. This additional insurance policy becomes available to customers in the event that SIPC limits are exhausted and provides protection for securities and cash up to an aggregate of $150 million. This insurance is provided to pay amounts in addition to those returned in a SIPC liquidation proceeding. This additional insurance policy is limited to a combined return to any customer from a Trustee, SIPC and London Underwriters of $37.5 million, including cash of up to $900,000. Like SIPC protection, this additional insurance does not protect against a loss in the market value of securities.

Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Options investors may lose the entire amount of their investment in a relatively short period of time.
Prior to buying or selling options, investors must read a copy of the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options brochure (PDF), also known as the options disclosure document. It explains the characteristics and risks of exchange traded options.

				Fraud warning			




Please be alert to fraudsters claiming to represent the Ashmore Group, one of its subsidiaries or its officers or employees.
Financial fraud is a global issue.
Criminals have become adept at creating plausible identities to defraud prospective investors. This includes the use of similar sounding email addresses, websites and fake profiles on social networking sites.
Please be aware that Ashmore does not cold-call investors to make investment offers, nor does it send unsolicited emails or letters.
If you have received contact from an organisation purporting to be connected to Ashmore or implying that Ashmore is its agent in any way, please contact us using the link to the left.
The Financial Conduct Authority provides advice with respect to investment scams: http://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/scams
Current alerts
"Health Lottery UK" is not affiliated to the Ashmore Group.  We received reports in July and August 2016 that Ashmore Investment Limited was referenced in fraudulent letters informing recipients of a lottery win.
"Ashmore Wealth Funds" is not affiliated to the Ashmore Group.  Ashmore has worked with the relevant investigative authorities and has taken steps to stop the use of the Ashmore trade mark.
The Financial Conduct Authority has added a warning about Ashmore Wealth Funds to their website, which can be found at: http://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/ashmore-wealth-funds-clone
“Ashmore Property Group” is not a part of the Ashmore Group plc group of companies.  We believe that persons representing Ashmore Property Group may be falsely offering investment opportunities and claiming to be a part of the Ashmore Group.  It is our understanding that these attempts may be fraudulent and you may lose your money if you deal with these people.  Ashmore has reported this matter to the Financial Conduct Authority.

What is an independent financial advisor?
Independent Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are professional independent advisory firms that provide personalized financial advice to their clients, many of whom have complex financial needs. Because these advisors are independent, they are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. As fiduciaries, they are held to the highest standard of care – and are required to act in the best interests of their clients at all times. They are registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators1.

Why does Charles Schwab support independent advisors?

Charles Schwab has provided custodial services to independent financial advisors for over 25 years. We are proud to support over 7,000 of these firms and the important work they do for their clients.






Why does it matter if your  advisor is independent?
Many independent advisory firms are owned by the individual advisors who run them, so they forge deep, personal relationships and have a strong sense of accountability to their clients.


Key Benefits:

Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture.
A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal.
A fee structure that is simple and transparent.
A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs.
Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.

Learn more about the key benefits






Choosing the right advisor.
Whether triggered by a life event or evolving goals, many people reach a point where they need more from their financial advisor. You may be asking yourself one of these questions:

Does the financial guidance I’m currently receiving truly reflect my goals?
Could I be getting more personalized attention from my advisor?
Is there a better way?

It can be a challenge to find an advisor that’s right for you. But there are tangible clues that can help you evaluate how responsive and accountable an advisor may be.

“The difference is approach”









Questions to ask yourself.
Whether you’re starting with a list of recommended advisors or you have a specific advisor in mind, starting with the three questions located in the tabs below can help you make a thoughtful choice.



What are my goals and preferences?
Consider these Factors: risk tolerance, time horizon, income, taxes, and holdings.
Being able to clearly articulate your needs and expectations will help you and the advisors you talk with make an informed decision about whether you’re right for each other. If you are an individual investor, your advisor should understand your goals and your particular financial situation and make recommendations that are suitable for you. Some important factors to consider in defining your goals include:

Investment Goals – What are you working toward: A comfortable retirement? Leaving a legacy? Philanthropic goals?
Risk Tolerance – How much fluctuation in value can you tolerate in exchange for the opportunity to earn above-average returns?
Time Horizon – When will you need to withdraw money from your investments?
Income Needs – Do you need current income from your portfolio? How much?
Tax Situation – Does your tax bracket require a tax-sensitive strategy?
Other Holdings – Do you have significant wealth tied up in real estate or other illiquid assets?
Other Needs – Do you have complex planning needs related to wealth transfer, executive compensation, risk management, business succession planning, or philanthropic planning?



What investment services do I need?

Consider what level of investment and advisory services you need. For example, some advisors provide clients with a pure investment management relationship while other advisors provide clients with sophisticated financial planning and advisory services in addition to investment management services.

Portfolio design
Discretionary portfolio management
Ongoing investment advice



Cash management

Planning

What is my preferred communication style?
You should also consider the nature of the client relationship that you would like with an investment advisor, including the frequency, level, and form of communication you would like to maintain with the advisor. How often would you like to communicate with your advisor? Would you like to communicate only by phone and email, or would you prefer to discuss your investments in person?

Interview questions to ask advisors.
As you begin to talk with advisors, you’ll want to evaluate them objectively. Asking each advisor a consistent set of questions will help ensure that you have the information you need to make a good comparison. 





What are your credentials?




An advisor’s professional designations can tell you a great deal about his or her education and areas of expertise.


CFP® (Certified Financial Planner™)
CFP professionals have completed university-level financial planning coursework and passed a 10-hour exam covering nearly 90 topics, from group medical insurance to derivatives.
                          More information >



CFA® (Chartered Financial Analyst®)
CFAs must pass three exams, each of which demands a minimum of 250 hours of study and includes corporate finance and financial statements.
                          More information >



PFS (Personal Financial Specialist)
Personal financial specialists are certified public accountants who specialize in personal financial planning. The credential requires a detailed exam and significant financial planning expertise.
                          More information >



CIMA® (Certified Investment Management Analyst®)
CIMAs focus on asset allocation and typically complete final coursework at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, or at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
                          More information >



Suggestion - Visit the website of the organization that issued an advisor’s credential to verify that the advisor is a member in good standing and to learn about the requirements for certification.
Common credentials - This is not a complete list of certifications. There is no implied endorsement of one certification over another. Professional designations attained by an advisor do not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.






Do you offer the services I need?




Investment advisory practices vary widely in the services they provide. In general, they fall into one or a combination of the categories listed below.


Money managers
If you need someone to manage your portfolio and do your investing, consider money managers. They:

Design investment portfolios, generally consisting of stocks, bonds, and other individual securities.
Often manage the portfolio on a discretionary basis, meaning that you authorize the advisor to trade on your behalf without the need for advance approval from you.
May not offer general financial planning services.



Financial planners
If you need someone to review your situation and help with big-picture planning, consider financial planners. They:

Help you look to the future and do long-term financial planning in the areas of retirement, college funding, wealth transfer, tax planning, and insurance.
May not offer investing and portfolio management services.



Wealth managers
If you need an advisor who can handle both your investing and planning needs, consider wealth managers. They:

Provide highly personalized, comprehensive financial planning as well as investment and portfolio management for high-net-worth clients.
Coordinate with other professional advisors, such as attorneys and accountants, to serve more complex financial needs, which may include tax minimization, trust management, wealth transfers, real estate management, and portfolio performance analytics.









How are you compensated?




Knowing how your advisor is compensated may help you evaluate the relative objectivity of the recommendations you receive. Independent advisors generally work on a fee-only or fee-plus-commissions basis.
Types of compensation and what they mean to you:


Fee only
Asset-based, hourly, or flat fees: Many independent advisors charge a percentage of the assets they manage for you (typically 1%–2%). This compensation method gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. Hourly or flat fees are often associated with a specific, one-time service (e.g., developing a financial plan). The fee may vary by account size and service. In addition to these fees, you may pay commissions and/or other fees for execution of the trades your advisor makes and for custody of your assets.


Fee plus commissions
Along with an advisory or financial planning fee, some advisors may receive a portion of the commissions you pay when you buy or sell certain financial products the advisor recommends, such as insurance policies or annuities.


Commissions only
Advisors sometimes receive compensation only from sales commissions on the investments they buy and sell for you.


Wrap fees
Sometimes advisors charge a wrap fee, which is typically a single asset-based fee for the advice they provide and the execution of the trades they make.








How will we work together?




Good communication between you and your advisor is essential. Asking the questions below can help you judge the amount of attention and regular communication you can expect.
What to ask:


With whom will I work?
In some cases, the firm’s principal may conduct your initial meeting and then turn your portfolio over to an associate or a team that actually manages it. If personal rapport is important to you, ask to meet with the people you’ll be working with.


How often will we communicate?
Regular contact helps ensure that you and your advisor are clear about your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Typically, your advisor meets you in person at least annually – and stays in touch more frequently by phone and email.


How will you report performance?
At a minimum, you should expect to receive:

Account statements from the advisor or custodian/brokerage firm where your assets are held.
Quarterly summaries of year-to-date investment performance.
A comprehensive annual performance report from your advisor.



What is the size of your firm?
A firm’s size – including the number of employees, the assets under management, and the average portfolio size – can have a bearing on the quality of service you receive.

Large firms may have more resources – an important consideration if your needs call for specialized services. Small firms may offer more personalized attention.
The average portfolio size of the advisor’s other clients helps you understand your potential fit with the firm.









How do you approach investing for people like me?




Things to consider:


Performance

Ask to see portfolio performance numbers for up and down markets1.
Ask the advisor to compare the performance with relevant benchmarks, such as the S&P 500® Index2, during the same time period.
An advisor should at least meet – and preferably beat – the benchmark.



Investment style

Advisors may specialize in certain types of investments (such as mutual funds, stocks, or bonds) and styles (such as growth or value).
You can assess whether the advisor's methodology or style aligns with your objectives.
Asking about an advisor's investment style is a good way to make sure that the advisor can explain his or her approach clearly and in a way that you understand.



Decision-making

Advisors who have a disciplined approach to decision-making may be more likely to stay focused on your long-term goals.
Many advisors use an asset allocation strategy that has a history of success over time. Your strategy should be based on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk.
Knowing how often an advisor adjusts portfolios can indicate whether the advisor uses a strategic, long-term approach or invests in short-term trends.




1Past performance does not guarantee future results.
2The S&P 500® Index is an index of widely traded stocks. Indexes are unmanaged, do not incur fees or expenses, and cannot be invested in directly.







Where will my assets be held?




Independent financial advisors typically use independent custodians – generally brokerage firms or banks – to hold and safeguard their clients’ stocks, mutual funds, and other assets.
Why should you ask this question?
You want to be confident that your advisor has chosen a custodian that meets or exceeds the security measures required by industry regulators to help protect your assets.

Look for a custodian with important services, such as trade execution and preparation of monthly brokerage statements, which allow your advisor to concentrate on managing your portfolio.

Ask about the custodian’s policies to help protect personal and financial information from unauthorized activity.










Preliminary screening.




You can review pertinent information about an advisor even before you meet
All independent advisors are required to publicly disclose details about their business by filing a Form ADV. You can review the Form ADVs on the SEC website at www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
Find a local advisor


Form ADV, Part 1 describes the advisor’s business, ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations, and disciplinary history.
Form ADV, Part 2 is a narrative brochure that describes in plain English the advisor’s services, fee schedule, disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the educational and business background of management and key advisory personnel. Advisors are required to give you this information before you hire them.

“Get acquainted with independent financial advisors”



Independent Financial Advisors
Understanding fiduciary.
As fiduciaries regulated under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, independent registered investment advisors are held by law to the highest standard of responsibility to their clients, therefore upholding them to always act in their clients’ best interests. This encourages a unique level of personalized service not always found in investor-advisor relationships.






Key benefits of independent registered investment advisors.



Customized guidance based on your entire financial picture
Independent advisors are not tied to any particular family of funds or investment products. So whether you need help with retirement planning, a tax situation, estate planning, or managing assets at multiple places, independent advisors have the freedom to choose from a wide range of investment options in order to tailor their advice based on what’s best for you.




A relationship that’s responsive, attentive, and personal
To offer advice closely aligned with your goals, independent advisors must first build a strong understanding of your situation. As a result, many independent advisors focus on building deep relationships with their clients. This often takes regular, ongoing interactions. And because many of these advisors are entrepreneurial business owners, they hold themselves personally accountable to their clients.




A fee structure that is simple and transparent
Independent advisors typically charge a fee based on a percentage of assets managed. This fee structure is simple, transparent, and easy to understand. It also gives your advisor an incentive to help grow your assets. When you succeed, your advisor succeeds.




A high level of expertise to support your complex financial needs
Independent advisors can help investors address the variety of complex investment needs that arise when you accumulate significant wealth. While specific services vary from firm to firm, they are often described as financial “quarterbacks” focused on your holistic financial picture. Some advisors are specialists in certain investment strategies. Others can assist you with comprehensive services, such as estate planning or borrowing, the sale of a business, complicated tax situations, trusts, and intergenerational wealth transfer.




Your money is held by an independent custodian, not the advisor firm.
Independent advisors use independent custodians, such as Charles Schwab and others, to hold and safeguard clients’ assets. For many investors, this provides a reassuring system of checks and balances – your money is not held by the same person who advises you about how to invest it.

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.

                            Navigate the money taboo and get together around what really matters—your family.
                        





What’s the hardest thing to talk about? Death, religion, politics? Would it surprise you to know that one of the most difficult things to discuss is money? When polled, 44% of Americans claimed that personal finance was the hardest to discuss – beating out politics and even death.1
Perhaps this is because money represents more than a topic – it can represent control, power, embarrassment, insecurity, fear. For some people, the hesitation stems from a natural reluctance to confront their own mortality or their potential for future disability. For others, avoiding the topic is caused by the perception that planning is associated with complicated—and expensive—legal and tax issues.

Silence Can Be Harmful



Avoiding these sometimes difficult conversations can have detrimental outcomes and unexpected consequences for your family, such as:
Passing On Bad Habits - Talking to your children about money now can help them avoid mistakes in the future. The key is to talk about what money means to you and why you worked hard to achieve your success. It involves being open about the challenges and responsibilities that accompany wealth – including what you might have wished you’d done differently when younger. And, most important, it’s about your values and what you wish for yourself and your children to accomplish with your privilege. The conversation can serve as an empowering first step to forming a healthy relationship with wealth.
Lost Opportunities - It’s never too early for your children to understand the value of creating a wealth plan that takes family members’ needs into account. Family members may not be aligned on priorities, such as long-term health care needs, charitable giving and generational gifting strategies, and taking the time to establish common goals is the first step in understanding how all members can participate in achieving them. 
The reality is that 70% of families lose their wealth by the second generation.[ii] Lack of communication can ultimately lead to misunderstandings and divergent objectives that could jeopardize your legacy and work against your values.
Costly Procrastination - Perhaps the hardest of conversations to have as an adult is with your aging parents. This is where the danger of putting it off grows exponentially. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, 70% of people over 65 will require some long-term care at some point in their lives.[iii] Once a crisis hits, it’s often too late. Now is the time to determine if sufficient long-term health care plans have been made, as well as who will make financial decisions on your parents’ behalf if they lose the ability to safely handle their money. Proper planning gives you time to discuss your decisions with family members. This open communication can help to reduce, if not eliminate, the risk of family discord, resentment or conflict.




Having a hard time starting a conversation about family finances? Here are a few questions to make it easy for you.



 
Is it important to talk about money as a family?




 
At what age do you hope to retire?




 
When is it ok to borrow money?




 
What's your favorite charitable cause and why?




 
How is your generation different from the generations before you?




 
Should children give to charity?

A New Paradigm for Family Wealth Planning











Align Your Goals with Strategies for Reaching Them



Morgan Stanley’s goals-based wealth planning framework strives to guard against more than just market volatility. We believe that a successful planning strategy must meet the following criteria:
1. Your plan should be customized to reflect what you care about most. It should address both the goals you hope to achieve and the risk of outliving your assets.
2. Your plan should address the shifting nature of issues and unknowns you face at different stages of your life and consider risks beyond market volatility, like inflation.
3. Your plan should seek to mitigate judgment and behavioral risks such as panic selling in difficult markets or overspending.





Smash the Taboo



We know it’s hard. Sitting down to discuss your parents’ long-term health needs or checking in with your siblings to see if you are all on the same page relating to any inheritance isn’t easy. What about your children; do they value the same causes that have moved you all your life? Is your spouse prepared should something happen to you?
The tough part is getting started, and that’s where bringing in an objective financial professional can help. We understand that wealth is about much more than just money, and can guide the conversation down those difficult paths to uncover the things that matter most to you and your family. We don’t believe in having a single conversation, but rather a series of talks that shift as your life changes. It’s a road. And you don’t have to travel it alone.
It starts with family, but doesn’t have to end there. We are ready to provide the guidance, tools and information that can help you tackle these difficult topics and transform them into meaningful discussions for your future. Uncover what matters most to you and find a Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to help guide the conversation. Because the road starts here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
