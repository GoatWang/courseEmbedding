Columbus, OH  43219, and Comenity Bank ("Bank"), a Delaware
state bank, with its principal place of business at One Righter
Parkway, Suite 100, Wilmington, DE  19803.

 

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS,
Bank and Servicer entered into that certain Amended and Restated
Service Agreement dated as of June 28, 2013 (the "2013 Amended and
Restated Service Agreement") to outsource certain data processing
activities and certain other administrative and servicing
functions; and

 

WHEREAS,
Bank and Servicer wish to amend and restate the 2013 Amended and
Restated Service Agreement in its entirety and enter into this
Agreement.

THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter
set forth, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, Servicer and
the Bank agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE
1

 

SERVICING
AND COMPENSATION

 

Section
1.1

 

Services
and Service Standards .

 

(a)

 

Covered
Services . 
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Servicer, as an independent
contractor, shall provide to the Bank the services as more fully
described in Appendix A (collectively, the
"Services").  Bank is not obligated to take each of the
Services, nor will Servicer have any right to be Bank's exclusive
provider of any such Services.  Bank may take and pay for any
of such Services at its discretion, or discontinue any Service(s),
in whole or in part, and obtain such Service(s) from a third
party.  The parties will work in good faith to determine an
appropriate reduction in the fee described in Section 1.2 for any
reduction in Services.  If Bank desires to terminate all
Services, such termination will be treated as a termination of this
Agreement and subject to Section 2.2.

 

(b)

 

Servicing
Standards . 
Servicer agrees to perform the Services in accordance with the
Service Standards set forth in Appendix B , or any other
service standards as specifically directed by Bank and agreed to by
Servicer for individual client(s).  To the extent that any
level of service required by Bank is not enumerated in Appendix
B , Servicer agrees to provide at least the same level of
service to Bank that Servicer provides to other clients.

Second
Amended and Restated Service Agreement

Comenity
Bank /Comenity Servicing LLC

  

(c)

 

Reporting
.  In
addition, Servicer shall continue to provide the number, types and
content of reports regarding servicing that it currently provides
Bank under the 2013 Amended and Restated Service Agreement, as well
as any other reports reasonably requested by Bank from time to
time.

 

(d)

 

Designation
of Servicing Representatives .  In
providing the Services, representatives of Servicer may state that
they are calling "on behalf of Comenity Bank" or "for Comenity
Bank" or refer to themselves as "Comenity Servicing" or use other
similar designations approved by Bank from time to time, but shall
not state that they are employees of Comenity Bank.

 

Section
1.2

 

Compensation
by Bank for Services . 
Bank shall pay Servicer for Services performed in accordance with
the fee schedule set forth in Appendix C . The fee set
forth in Appendix C shall become due and payable by Bank not
later than the 15th business day following the end of the preceding
month, provided, however, that if, in the reasonable business
judgment of Bank, Servicer fails to meet any single Product Service
Standard or Other Service Standard for 2 of 3 consecutive months,
then the fee set forth in Appendix C shall be automatically
reduced by 0.5% in the case of Product Service Standards or 0.1% in
the case of Other Service Standards, but in no event more than 0.5%
in total, for the month in which the repeat failure occurred, and
that amount, as reduced, shall be the amount which is due and
payable by the Bank.

 

Section
1.3

 

Bank
Duties . 
Insofar as the performance of Services under this Agreement
requires data, documents, information or materials required to be
furnished by Bank, Bank agrees to furnish the data, documents,
information or materials reasonably necessary and within such time
as may reasonably be necessary in order for Servicer to perform the
Services in a prompt workmanlike manner and within the service
standards set forth herein.

 

ARTICLE

TERM AND
TERMINATION

 

Section
2.1

 

Term
. 
This Agreement shall become effective as of April 1, 2016 (the
"Effective Date") and shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of two (2) years from such date ("Initial Term"), unless
terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
This Agreement shall automatically renew for consecutive one (1)
year terms (each a "Renewal Term"), unless terminated by either
party as specified below.

 

Section
2.2

if Bank fails to make any payment when due, and such failure is not
cured within thirty (30) calendar days; (ii) if either party 
fails to perform any of its material obligations or duties under
this Agreement or commits a material breach of its representations
and warranties and such failure to perform or breach is not cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice is provided to the
defaulting party; (iii) if either party gives at least thirty (30)
days prior written notice of termination to the other party; or
(iv) if either party becomes insolvent or generally unable to pay
its debts as they become due or shall become the subject of a

and Servicer's obligations to pay Bank pursuant to Appendix
B , shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

Section
2.4

 

Step-In
Right .  If
Bank's right to terminate this Agreement arises pursuant to clause
(iv) of Section 2.2, in addition to Bank's termination right and
regardless of whether Bank exercises such right, the following
shall apply:

 

(a)

shall continue to provide the Service in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, including for the one hundred eighty (180)
post-termination transition period referenced in Section 2.2
above.

 

(b)

shall provide Bank such access to the computer systems (hardware
and software) and data used by Servicer to provide the Services
hereunder, including general ledger systems, reporting systems,
network and information systems, records systems, system backup
data, and tax information, as shall be necessary to enable Bank to
ensure the continued availability of Services pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(c)

 

Bank
shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to assume managerial
oversight of all Service personnel involved in the provision of the
Services to Bank for the sole purpose of ensuring the continued
availability of Services pursuant to this Agreement.

extent permitted by applicable law, Servicer shall, at Bank's sole

ARTICLE II CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES

SECTION 2.1. CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES. (a) By execution of this    
Agreement, Transferor transfers, assigns, sets over and otherwise conveys to the
Trustee, for the benefit of the Investor Holders, all of its right, title and   
interest in, to and under (i) the Receivables existing at the close of business 
on the Trust Cut Off Date and thereafter arising from time to time in the       
Initial Accounts and the Receivables existing on each applicable Addition Date  
and thereafter arising from time to time in the Accounts in the Restatement Date
Portfolios identified in the Account Schedule delivered on August 20, 2001 and  
the Automatic Additional Accounts, all Recoveries allocable to the Trust as     
provided herein, all moneys due or to become due and all amounts received with  
respect to, and proceeds of, any of the foregoing, (ii) all of its rights,      
remedies, powers and privileges under the Receivables Purchase Agreement and    
(iii) without limiting the generality of the foregoing or the following, all of 
Transferor's rights pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement to receive   
from the RPA Seller payments made by any Merchant under any Credit Card         
Processing Agreement on account of amounts received by such Merchant in payment 
of Receivables ("IN-STORE PAYMENTS") and all proceeds of such rights. Such      
property, together with all moneys on deposit in the Collection Account, the    
Excess Funding Account and the Series Accounts and any Enhancement shall        
constitute the assets of the Trust (the "TRUST ASSETS"). The foregoing does not 
constitute and is not intended to result in the creation or assumption by the   
Trust, Trustee, any Investor Holders or any Enhancement Provider of any         
obligation of the Credit Card Originator, Servicer, Transferor or any other     
Person in connection with the Accounts or the Receivables or under any agreement
or instrument relating thereto, including any obligation to obligors, merchant  
banks, merchants clearance systems or insurers. The parties hereto intend that  
each transfer of Receivables and other property pursuant to the Agreement or any
Assignment constitute a sale, and not a secured borrowing, for accounting       
purposes. If the foregoing transfer, assignment, setover and conveyance is not  
deemed to be an absolute assignment of the subject property to the Trustee, for 
the benefit of the Investor Holders, then it shall be deemed to constitute a    
grant of a security interest in such property to the Trustee, for the benefit of
the Investor Holders, and the Transferor Interest shall be deemed to represent  
Transferor's equity in the collateral granted.                                  

   (b) Transferor agrees to record and file, at its own expense, financing
statements (and continuation statements when applicable) with respect to the    
Receivables now existing and

hereafter created in Accounts owned by the Credit Card Originator and other     
Trust Assets meeting the requirements of applicable state law in such manner and
in such jurisdictions as are necessary to perfect, and maintain the perfection  
of, the assignment of such Receivables to the Trust, and to deliver a file      
stamped copy of each such financing statement or other evidence of such filing  
(which may, for purposes of this SECTION 2.1 consist of telephone confirmation  
of such filing promptly followed by delivery to Trustee of a file-stamped copy) 
to Trustee on or prior to the Initial Closing Date, in the case of such         
Receivables arising in the Initial Accounts and Automatic Additional Accounts   
included in the Identified Portfolio, and (if any additional filing is so       
necessary) the applicable Addition Date, in the case of such Receivables arising
in Supplemental Accounts and any related Automatic Additional Accounts. Trustee 
shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file or maintain such financing or   
continuation statements or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection 
with such assignment.                                                           

     (c) Transferor further agrees, at its own expense, (i) on or prior to (A)
the Automatic Addition Termination Date or any Automatic Addition Suspension    
Date, or subsequent to a Restart Date, in the case of the Initial Accounts and  
any Additional Accounts designated pursuant hereto prior to such date, (B) the  
applicable Addition Date, in the case of Supplemental Accounts and (C) the      
applicable Removal Date, in the case of Removed Accounts, to cause to be        
indicated in the appropriate computer files that Receivables created in         
connection with the Accounts owned by the Credit Card Originator (other than    
Removed Accounts) have been conveyed to the Trust pursuant to this Agreement for
the benefit of the Holders (or conveyed to Transferor or its designee in        
accordance with SECTION 2.9, in the case of Removed Accounts) by including in   
such computer files the code identifying each such Account (or, in the case of  
Removed Accounts, either including such a code identifying the Removed Accounts 
only if the removal occurs prior to the Automatic Addition Termination Date or  
an Automatic Addition Suspension Date, or subsequent to a Restart Date, or      
deleting such code thereafter) and (ii) on or prior to the date referred to in  
CLAUSES (i)(A), (B) or (C), as applicable, to deliver to Trustee an Account     
Schedule (PROVIDED that such Account Schedule shall be provided in respect of   
Automatic Additional Accounts on or prior to the Determination Date relating to 
the Monthly Period during which their respective Addition Dates occur),         
specifying for each such Account, as of the Automatic Addition Termination Date 
or Automatic Addition Suspension Date, in the case of CLAUSE (i)(B), the        
applicable Addition Cut Off Date, in the case of Supplemental Accounts, and the 
Removal Date, in the case of Removed Accounts, its account number, the aggregate
amount outstanding in such Account and the aggregate amount of Principal        
Receivables outstanding in such Account. Such Account Schedule shall be         
supplemented from time to time to reflect Supplemental Accounts and Removed     
Accounts. Once the code referenced in CLAUSE (i) of this paragraph has been     
included with respect to any Account, Transferor further agrees not to permit   
such code to be altered during the remaining term of this Agreement unless and  
until (x) such Account becomes a Removed Account, (y) a Restart Date has        
occurred on which the Transferor starts including Automatic Additional Accounts 
as Accounts or (z) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee at least 30 days' 
prior written notice of its intention to do so and has taken such action as is  
necessary or advisable to cause the interest of Trustee in the Receivables and  
other Trust Assets to continue to be perfected with the priority required by    
this Agreement.                                                                 

   (d) By executing this Agreement and the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
the parties hereto and thereto do not intend to cancel, release or in any way   
impair the conveyance made by

Transaction Document and the Certificates, the performance by Transferor of the

consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by any Transaction Document

reasonable judgment of Transferor, would materially and adversely affect the    
performance by Transferor of its obligations under any Transaction Document,

Affiliates (other than Liens permitted under SECTION 2.7(b)) and in 
compliance, in all material respects, with all Requirements of Law

financing statements pursuant to SECTION 2.1 and, in the case of    
     Receivables hereafter created and the proceeds thereof, upon the creation
    thereof, the Trust shall have a first priority security interest in such
  property and proceeds except for Liens permitted under SECTION 2.7(b);

            (vi) except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any
   Supplement, neither Transferor nor any Person claiming through or under
  Transferor has any claim to or interest in the Collection Account, the
Excess Funding Account, any Series Account or any Enhancement;      

     (vii) on the Trust Cut Off Date, with respect to each Initial
    Account, on the date of its creation or the date it otherwise becomes an
   Automatic Additional Account, with respect to each Automatic Additional
      Account and, on the applicable Addition Cut Off Date, with respect to each
   related Supplemental Account, each such Account is an Eligible Account;

          (viii) on the Trust Cut Off Date, each Receivable then existing is
an Eligible Receivable, on the date of creation of each Automatic   
Additional Account or the date the                                  

26

   related account otherwise becomes an Automatic Additional Account, each
    Receivable contained in such Automatic Additional Account is an Eligible
    Receivable and, on the applicable Addition Cut Off Date, each Receivable
    contained in any related Supplemental Account is an Eligible Receivable;
and                                                                 

       (ix) as of the date of the creation of any new Receivable, such
Receivable is an Eligible Receivable.                               

      (b) PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Transferor hereby makes the
Perfection Representations and Warranties to the Trust. The rights and remedies 
with respect to any breach of the Perfection Representations and Warranties made
under this SECTION 2.4(b) shall be continuing and shall survive any termination 
of this Agreement. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee shall waive a breach of any
Perfection Representation and Warranty. In order to evidence the interests of   
the Transferor and the Trust under this Agreement, the Transferor and Servicer  
shall, from time to time take such action, and execute and deliver such         
instruments (including, without limitation, such actions or filings as are      
requested by the Trustee and financing statements under the UCC as enacted and  
then in effect in any other jurisdiction in which the Transferor is organized,  
has its principal place of business or maintains any books, records, files, or  
other information concerning the Receivables) in order to maintain and perfect, 
as a first priority interest, the security interest in the Receivables. The     
Transferor hereby authorizes Servicer to file financing statements under the UCC
without the Transferor's signature where allowed by applicable law.             

      (c) NOTICE OF BREACH. The representations and warranties of Transferor set
forth in this SECTION 2.4 shall survive the transfer and assignment by          
Transferor of Receivables to the Trust. Upon discovery by Transferor, Servicer  
or Trustee of a breach of any of the representations and warranties by          
Transferor set forth in this SECTION 2.4, the party discovering such breach     
shall give prompt written notice to the others and to each Enhancement Provider,
if any, entitled thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement. Transferor agrees 
to cooperate with Servicer and Trustee in attempting to cure any such breach.   
For purposes of the representations and warranties set forth in this SECTION    
2.4, each reference to a Supplement shall be deemed to refer only to those      
Supplements in effect as of the date of the relevant representations or         
warranties.                                                                     

 SECTION 2.5. REASSIGNMENT OF INELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES. (a) REASSIGNMENT OF
RECEIVABLES. If (i) any representation or warranty of Transferor contained in   
SECTION 2.4(a)(ii), (iii), (iv), (vii), (viii) or (ix) is not true and correct  
in any material respect as of the date specified therein with respect to any    
Receivable transferred to the Trust by Transferor or any Account and as a result
of such breach any Receivables in the related Account become Defaulted          
Receivables or the Trust's rights in, to or under such Receivables or the       
proceeds of such Receivables are impaired or such proceeds are not available for
any reason to the Trust free and clear of any Lien, unless cured within 60 days 
(or such longer period, not in excess of 150 days, as may be agreed to by       
Trustee) after the earlier to occur of the discovery thereof by Transferor or   
receipt by Transferor or a designee of Transferor of notice thereof given by    
Trustee, or (ii) it is so provided in SECTION 2.7(a) with respect to any        
Receivables transferred to the Trust by Transferor, then such Receivable shall  
be designated an "INELIGIBLE RECEIVABLE" and shall be assigned a principal      
balance of zero for the purpose of determining the aggregate amount of Principal
Receivables on any day; PROVIDED that such Receivables will not be deemed to be 
Ineligible                                                                      

27

P-->EX-4.634th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 34th
Receivables but will be deemed Eligible Receivables and such Principal          
Receivables shall be included in determining the aggregate Principal Receivables
in the Trust if, on any day prior to the end of such 60-day or longer period,   
(x) either (A) in the case of an event described in CLAUSE (i), the relevant    
representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects  
as if made on such day or (B) in the case of an event described in CLAUSE (ii), 
the circumstances causing such Receivable to become an Ineligible Receivable    
shall no longer exist and (y) Transferor shall have delivered an Officer's      
Certificate describing the nature of such breach and the manner in which the    
relevant representation and warranty became true and correct.                   

     (b) PRICE OF REASSIGNMENT. On and after the date of its designation as an
Ineligible Receivable, each Ineligible Receivable shall not be given credit in  
determining the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables used to calculate the 
Transferor Amount or the Investor Percentages applicable to any Series. If,     
following the exclusion of such Principal Receivables from the calculation of   
the Transferor Amount, the Transferor Amount would be less than the Specified   
Transferor Amount, Transferor shall make a deposit into the Excess Funding      
Account in immediately available funds prior to the next succeeding Business Day
in an amount equal to the amount by which the Transferor Amount would be less   
than the Specified Transferor Amount (up to the amount of such Principal        
Receivables). The payment of such deposit amount in immediately available funds 
shall otherwise be considered payment in full of all of the Ineligible          
Receivables.                                                                    

     The obligation of Transferor to make the deposits, if any, required to be
made to the Excess Funding Account as provided in this Section, shall constitute
the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to such obligation available to
Holders (or Trustee on behalf of the Holders) or any Enhancement Provider.      

SECTION 2.6. REASSIGNMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN TRUST PORTFOLIO. If any 
representation or warranty of Transferor set forth in SECTION 2.3(a), (b) or (c)
or SECTION 2.4(a)(i), (v) or (vi) is not true and correct in any material       
respect and such breach has a material adverse effect on the Investor Interest  
in the Receivables transferred to the Trust by Transferor, then either Trustee  
or the Majority Holders, by notice then given to Transferor and Servicer (and to
Trustee if given by the Investor Holders), may direct Transferor to accept a    
reassignment of the Receivables transferred to the Trust by Transferor if such  
breach and any material adverse effect caused by such breach is not cured within
60 days of such notice (or within such longer period, not in excess of 150 days,
as may be specified in such notice), and upon those conditions Transferor shall 
be obligated to accept such reassignment on the terms set forth below; PROVIDED 
that such Receivables will not be reassigned to Transferor if, on any day prior 
to the end of such 60-day or longer period (i) the relevant representation and  
warranty shall be true and correct in all material respects as if made on such  
day and (ii) Transferor shall have delivered an Officer's Certificate describing
the nature of such breach and the manner in which the relevant representation   
and warranty became true and correct.                                           

Transferor shall deposit in the Collection Account in immediately   
available funds not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the first     
Distribution Date following the Monthly Period in which such reassignment       
obligation arises, in payment for such reassignment, an amount equal to the sum 
of the amounts specified therefor with respect to each outstanding Series in the
related Supplement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, 

28

P-->EX-4.635th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 35th
such amounts shall be distributed on such Distribution Date in accordance with  
ARTICLE IV and each Supplement. The payment of such deposit amount in           
immediately available funds shall otherwise be considered payment in full of all
of the Receivables.                                                             

      Upon the deposit, if any, required to be made to the Collection Account as
provided in this Section or SECTION 2.5, Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, shall 
automatically and without further action be deemed to transfer, assign, set over
and otherwise convey to Transferor or its designee, without recourse,           
representation or warranty (except for the warranty that since the date of      
transfer by Transferor, Trustee has not sold, transferred or encumbered any such
Receivables or interest therein), all the right, title and interest of the Trust
in and to the applicable Receivables, all moneys due or to become due and all   
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof. Trustee shall   
execute such documents and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such  
other actions as shall reasonably be requested by Transferor to effect the      
conveyance of such Receivables pursuant to this Section. The obligation of      
Transferor to accept reassignment of any Receivables, and to make the deposits, 
if any, required to be made to the Collection Account as provided in this       
Section, shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to   
such obligation available to Holders (or Trustee on behalf of the Holders).     

SECTION 2.7. Covenants of Transferor. Transferor covenants as follows:

     (a) RECEIVABLES TO BE ACCOUNTS. Except in connection with the enforcement
or collection of an Account, Transferor will take no action to cause any        
Receivable transferred by it to the Trust to be evidenced by any instrument and,
if any such Receivable is so evidenced (whether or not in connection with the   
enforcement or collection of an Account), it shall be deemed to be an Ineligible
Receivable in accordance with SECTION 2.5(a) and shall be reassigned to         
Transferor in accordance with SECTION 2.5(b).                                   

    (b) SECURITY INTERESTS. Except for the conveyances hereunder, Transferor
will not sell, pledge, assign or transfer or otherwise convey to any other      
Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any      
Receivable, whether now existing or hereafter created, or any interest therein; 
Transferor will immediately notify Trustee of the existence of any Lien on any  
Receivable of which Transferor has knowledge; and Transferor shall defend the   
right, title and interest of the Trust in, to and under the Receivables, whether
now existing or hereafter created, against all claims of third parties claiming 
through or under Transferor or RPA Seller; PROVIDED that nothing in this SECTION
2.7(b) shall prevent or be deemed to prohibit Transferor from suffering to exist
upon any of the Receivables any Liens for taxes if such taxes shall not at the  
time be due and payable or if Transferor or RPA Seller, as applicable, shall    
currently be contesting the validity thereof in good faith by appropriate       
proceedings and shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this SECTION 2.7(b) shall be 
construed to prevent or be deemed to prohibit the transfer of the Transferor    
Interest and certain other rights of Transferor in accordance with this         
Agreement and any related Supplement.                                           

    (c) TRANSFEROR INTEREST. Except as otherwise permitted herein, including
in SECTIONS 2.11, 6.3 and 7.2, Transferor agrees not to transfer, assign,       
exchange or otherwise convey or pledge, hypothecate or otherwise grant a        
security interest in the Transferor Interest (or any interest therein) or any   
Supplemental Interest (or any interest                                          

29

P-->EX-4.636th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 36th
therein) and any such attempted transfer, assignment, exchange, conveyance,     
pledge, hypothecation or grant shall be void.                                   

(d) DELIVERY OF COLLECTIONS OR RECOVERIES. If Transferor receives   
Collections or Recoveries, then Transferor agrees to pay Servicer all such      
Collections and Recoveries as soon as practicable after receipt thereof but in  
no event later than two Business Days after the Date of Processing by           
Transferor.                                                                     

     (e) NOTICE OF LIENS. Transferor shall notify Trustee and each Enhancement
Provider, if any, entitled to such notice pursuant to the relevant Supplement   
promptly after becoming aware of any Lien on any Receivable other than the      
conveyances hereunder or Liens permitted under SECTION 2.7(b).                  

     (f) CONTINUOUS PERFECTION. Transferor shall not change its name, identity
or structure in any manner that might cause any financing or continuation       
statement filed pursuant to this Agreement to be misleading within the meaning  
of Section 9-402(7) of the UCC (or any other then applicable provision of the   
UCC) unless Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee at least 30 days prior   
written notice thereof and, no later than 30 days after making such change,     
shall have taken all action necessary or advisable to amend such financing      
statement or continuation statement so that it is not misleading. Transferor    
shall not change its chief executive office, jurisdiction of organization or    
change the location of its principal records concerning the Receivables, the    
Trust Assets or the Collections unless it has delivered to Trustee at least 30  
days prior written notice of its intention to do so and has taken such action as
is necessary or advisable to cause the interest of Trustee in the Receivables   
and other Trust Assets to continue to be perfected with the priority required by
this Agreement.                                                                 

  (g) CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT AND GUIDELINES. Transferor shall enforce the
covenant in the Receivables Purchase Agreement requiring the Credit Card        
Originator to comply with and perform its obligations under the Credit Card     
Agreements relating to the Accounts and the Credit Card Guidelines except       
insofar as any failure to comply or perform would not materially or adversely   
affect the rights of the Trust or the Holders under any Transaction Document or 
the Certificates. Transferor may permit the Credit Card Originator to change the
terms and provisions of the Credit Card Agreements or the Credit Card Guidelines
in any respect (including the reduction of the required minimum monthly payment,
the calculation of the amount, or the timing, of charge offs and Periodic       
Finance Charges and other fees assessed thereon), but only if such change is    
made applicable to any comparable segment of the revolving credit card accounts 
owned and serviced by the Credit Card Originator which have characteristics the 
same as, or substantially similar to, the Accounts that are the subject of such 
change, except as otherwise restricted by an endorsement, sponsorship or other  
agreement between Transferor and an unrelated third party or by the terms of the
Credit Card Agreements.                                                         

(h) RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT. Transferor, in its capacity as  
purchaser of Receivables from RPA Seller under the Receivables Purchase         
Agreement, shall enforce the covenants and agreement of RPA Seller as set forth 
in the Receivables Purchase Agreement if the failure of RPA Seller to comply    
with such covenants and agreements would (i) result in the occurrence of an     
Early Amortization Event or (b) materially and adversely effect the amount or   

30

P-->EX-4.637th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 37th
timing of distributions to be made to the Investor Certificateholders of any    
Series or Class pursuant to the Transaction Documents.                          

    (i) OFFICIAL RECORDS. The resolutions of Transferor's Board of Directors
approving each of the Transaction Documents and all documents relating thereto  
are and shall be continuously reflected in the minutes of Transferor's Board of 
Directors. Each of the Transaction Documents and all documents relating thereto 
are and shall, continuously from the time of their respective execution by      
Transferor, be official records of Transferor.                                  

(j) ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS. If Transferor is unable for any reason to  
transfer Receivables to the Trust in accordance with the provisions of this     
Agreement (including by reason of the application of the provisions of SECTION  
9.2 or an order by any Federal governmental agency having regulatory authority  
over Transferor or any court of competent jurisdiction that Transferor not      
transfer any additional Principal Receivables to the Trust) then, in any such   
event: (A) Transferor agrees to allocate and pay to the Trust, after the date of
such inability, all Collections with respect to Principal Receivables, all      
Discount Option Receivables Collections, and all amounts which would have       
constituted Collections with respect to Principal Receivables and all Discount  
Option Receivables Collections but for Transferor's inability to transfer such  
Receivables (up to an aggregate amount equal to the amount of Principal         
Receivables and the Discount Option Receivables Amount in the Trust on such     
date); (B) Transferor agrees to have such amounts applied as Collections in     
accordance with ARTICLE IV; and (C) for only so long as all Collections and all 
amounts which would have constituted Collections are allocated and applied in   
accordance with CLAUSES (A) and (B), Principal Receivables and Discount Option  
Receivables (and all amounts which would have constituted Principal Receivables 
or Discount Option Receivables, as the case may be, but for Transferor's        
inability to transfer Receivables to the Trust) that are charged off as         
uncollectible in accordance with this Agreement shall continue to be allocated  
in accordance with ARTICLE IV, and all amounts that would have constituted      
Principal Receivables or Discount Option Receivables, as the case may be, but   
for Transferor's inability to transfer Receivables to the Trust shall be deemed 
to be Principal Receivables or Discount Option Receivables, as the case may be, 
for the purpose of calculating the applicable Investor Percentage with respect  
to any Series. If Transferor is unable pursuant to any Requirement of Law to    
allocate Collections as described above, Transferor agrees that it shall in any 
such event allocate, after the occurrence of such event, payments on each       
Account with respect to the principal balance of such Account first to the      
oldest principal balance of such Account and to have such payments applied as   
Collections in accordance with ARTICLE IV. The parties hereto agree that Finance
Charge Receivables, whenever created, accrued in respect of Principal           
Receivables that have been conveyed to the Trust, or that would have been       
conveyed to the Trust but for the above described inability to transfer such    
Receivables, shall continue to be a part of the Trust notwithstanding any       
cessation of the transfer of additional Principal Receivables and Discount      
Option Receivables to the Trust, and Collections with respect thereto shall     
continue to be allocated and paid in accordance with ARTICLE IV.                

 (k) PERIODIC FINANCE CHARGES AND OTHER FEES. Transferor hereby agrees
that, except as otherwise required by any Requirement of Law, or as is deemed by
the Credit Card Originator to be necessary in order for it to maintain its      
credit card business, based upon a good faith assessment by the Credit Card     
Originator, in its sole discretion, of the nature of the competition in the     
credit card business, it shall not at any time permit the Credit Card Originator
to reduce the                                                                   

31

P-->EX-4.638th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 38th
Periodic Finance Charges assessed on any Receivable or other fees on any Account
if, as a result of such reduction, Transferor's reasonable expectation of the   
Portfolio Yield for any Series as of such date would be less than the then Base 
Rate for that Series.                                                           

(l) NOTICES OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Transferor shall promptly notify each
Rating Agency after Transferor obtains knowledge that: (i) the Welsh, Carson,   
Anderson & Stowe Partnerships and The Limited and its Affiliates (in the        
aggregate) fail to own a majority of the outstanding common stock of Holding    
(PROVIDED that common stock owned by employees, either individually or through  
employee stock ownership or other stock based benefit plans, shall not be       
included in the calculation of ownership interests for this purpose); (ii) any  
Merchant whose program gives rise to more than 10% of the Principal Receivables 
(measured as of the end of the most recent Monthly Period) terminates its       
private label credit card program with the Bank; (iii) the Trustee gives a      
resignation notice pursuant to SECTION 11.7; or (iv) an Additional Limitation   
Event or an Automatic Addition Limitation Event occurs.                         

    (m) AMENDMENT OF ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS. Transferor shall not amend in
any material respect its certificate of formation or its limited liability      
company agreement without providing the Rating Agencies with notice no later    
than the fifth Business Day prior to such amendment (unless the right to such   
notice is waived by the Rating Agency) and satisfying the Rating Agency         
Condition.                                                                      

      (n) OTHER INDEBTEDNESS. Except as contemplated by the Receivables Purchase
Agreement, the Transferor shall not incur any additional debt, unless (i) such  
debt is contemplated by the Transaction Documents or (ii) the Rating Agencies   
are provided with notice no later than the fifth Business Day prior to the      
incurrence of such additional debt (unless the right to such notice is waived by
the Rating Agency) and the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied with respect to 
the incurrence of such debt.                                                    

(o) SEPARATE CORPORATE EXISTENCE. The Transferor shall:             

           (i) Maintain in full effect its existence, rights and franchises as
a limited liability company under the laws of the state of its      
      organization and will obtain and preserve its qualification to do business
     in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall be necessary
to protect the validity and enforceability of this Agreement and the
 Receivables Purchase Agreement and each other instrument or agreement
   necessary or appropriate to proper administration hereof and permit and
effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby.                    

            (ii) Except as provided herein, maintain its own deposit, securities
      and other account or accounts, separate from those of any Affiliate of the
      Transferor, with financial institutions. The funds of the Transferor shall
      not be diverted to any other Person or for other than the corporate use of
the Transferor, and, except as may be expressly permitted by this   
Agreement or the Receivables Purchase Agreement, the funds of the   
Transferor shall not be commingled with those of any other person or
entity.                                                             

            (iii) Ensure that, to the extent that it shares the same officers or
     other employees as any of its stockholders or Affiliates, the salaries of
and the expenses related to                                         

32

P-->EX-4.639th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 39th
   providing benefits to such officers and other employees shall be fairly
   allocated among such entities, and each such entity shall bear its fair
 share of the salary and benefit costs associated with all such common
officers and employees.                                             

          (iv) Ensure that, to the extent that it jointly contracts with any
    of its stockholders or Affiliates to do business with vendors or service
   providers or to share overhead expenses, the costs incurred in so doing
     shall be allocated fairly among entities, and each such entity shall bear
     its fair share of such costs. To the extent that the Transferor contracts
  or does business with vendors or service providers where the goods and
    services provided are partially for the benefit of any other Person, the
 costs incurred in so doing shall be fairly allocated to or among such
    entities for whose benefit the goods and services are provided, and each
such entity shall bear its fair share of such costs. All material   
  transactions between the Transferor and any of its Affiliates shall be
only on an arm's-length basis and shall receive the approval of the 
Transferor's Board of Directors including at least one Independent  
Director (defined below).                                           

            (v) Maintain a principal executive and administrative office through
      which its business is conducted and a telephone number separate from those
     of its stockholders and Affiliates. To the extent that the Transferor and
    any of its members or Affiliates have offices in contiguous space, there
 shall be fair and appropriate allocation of overhead costs (including
    rent) among them, and each such entity shall bear its fair share of such
expenses.                                                           

            (vi) Conduct its affairs strictly in accordance with its certificate
of formation and observe all necessary, appropriate and customary   
    corporate formalities including, but not limited to, holding all regular
and special directors' meetings appropriate to authorize all limited
   liability company action, keeping separate and accurate minutes of such
meetings, passing all resolutions or consents necessary to authorize
      actions taken or to be taken, and maintaining accurate and separate books,
records and accounts, including, but not limited to, intercompany   
    transaction accounts. Regular directors' meetings shall be held at least
annually.                                                           

          (vii) Ensure that decisions with respect to its business and daily
  operations shall be independently made by the Transferor (although the
     officer making any particular decision may also be an officer or director
of an Affiliate of the Transferor) and shall not be dictated by any 
Affiliate of the Transferor.                                        

   (viii) Act solely in its own legal name and through its own
authorized officers and agents, and, except as contemplated by the  
    Transaction Documents, no Affiliate of the Transferor shall be appointed
    to act as agent of the Transferor. The Transferor shall at all times use
   its own stationery and business forms and describe itself as a separate
legal entity.                                                       

          (ix) Except as contemplated by the Receivables Purchase Agreement,
ensure that none of its Affiliates shall advance funds to it, and no
Affiliate of the Transferor will otherwise guaranty its debts.      

33

P-->EX-4.640th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 40th
        (x) Other than organizational expenses and as expressly provided
    herein, pay all expenses, indebtedness and other obligations incurred by
it using its own funds.                                             

          (xi) Not enter into any guaranty, or otherwise become liable, with
    respect to or hold its assets or creditworthiness out as being available
for the payment of any obligation of any of its Affiliates.         

          (xii) Ensure that any financial reports required of the Transferor
  shall comply with GAAP and shall be issued separately from, but may be
     consolidated with, any reports prepared for any of its Affiliates so long
   as such consolidated reports contain footnotes describing the effect of
     the transactions between the Transferor and such Affiliate and also state
   that the assets of the Transferor are not available to pay creditors of
the Affiliate.                                                      

       (xiii) Ensure that at all times it is adequately capitalized to
   engage in the transactions contemplated in its certificate of formation
and limited liability company agreement.                            

 SECTION 2.8. ADDITION OF ACCOUNTS. (a) AUTOMATIC ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTS.
Subject to the limitations specified below in this SECTION 2.8(a) and to any    
further limitations specified in any Supplement, Automatic Additional Accounts  
shall be included as Accounts from and after the date upon which they are       
created, and all Receivables in Automatic Additional Accounts, whether such     
Receivables are then existing or thereafter created, shall be transferred       
automatically to the Trust upon their creation. For all purposes of this        
Agreement, all receivables relating to Automatic Additional Accounts shall be   
treated as Receivables upon their creation and shall be subject to the          
eligibility criteria specified in the definitions of "Eligible Receivable" and  
"Eligible Account." Transferor may elect at any time to terminate the inclusion 
in Accounts of new accounts which would otherwise be Automatic Additional       
Accounts as of any Business Day (the "AUTOMATIC ADDITION TERMINATION DATE"), or 
suspend any such inclusion as of any Business Day (an "AUTOMATIC ADDITION       
SUSPENSION DATE") until a date (the "RESTART DATE") to be notified in writing by
Transferor to Trustee by delivering to Trustee, Servicer and each Rating Agency 
ten days prior written notice of such election at least 10 days prior to such   
Automatic Addition Termination Date, Automatic Addition Suspension Date or      
Restart Date, as the case may be. Promptly after each of an Automatic Addition  
Termination Date, an Automatic Addition Suspension Date and a Restart Date,     
Transferor and Trustee agree to execute, and Transferor agrees to record and    
file at its own expense, an amendment to the financing statements referred to in
SECTION 2.1 to specify the accounts then subject to this Agreement (which       
specification may incorporate a list of accounts by reference) and, except in   
connection with any such filing made after a Restart Date, to release any       
security interest in any accounts created after the Automatic Addition          
Termination Date or Automatic Addition Suspension Date. Notwithstanding the     
foregoing, during any period after an Automatic Addition Limitation Event has   
occurred and before the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied as to the    
resumption of treating new accounts as Automatic Additional Accounts, no new    
accounts that would otherwise be Automatic Additional Accounts shall be treated 
as such on any Addition Date if the number of such Automatic Additional Accounts
would exceed an amount equal to the greater of:                                 

34

P-->EX-4.641st Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 41st
     (i) the excess (if any) of (1) 20% of the aggregate number of
    Accounts determined as of the first day of the fiscal year of Transferor
in which the Addition Date occurs OVER (2) the aggregate amount of  
     Automatic Additional Accounts and Supplemental Accounts the Addition Date
for which has occurred since the first day of such fiscal year; and 

      (ii) the excess (if any) of (1) 15% of the aggregate number of
Accounts determined as of the first day of the fiscal quarter of    
      Transferor in which the Addition Date occurs OVER (2) the aggregate amount
   of Automatic Additional Accounts and Supplemental Accounts the Addition
   Date for which has occurred since the first day of such fiscal quarter.

    In addition, no new account arising in a Restatement Date Portfolio will
be treated as an Automatic Additional Account if, as a result of doing so, the  
aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in Accounts in the Restatement Date   
Portfolios would exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Principal Receivables in 
the Trust; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, such limitation shall no longer apply after S&P   
shall have confirmed in writing that additions of such Accounts in excess of the
10% limitation shall not cause a reduction or withdrawal of the rating on any   
then outstanding Series or Class rated by S&P.                                  

   In addition, during any period after an Additional Limitation Event has
occurred and before the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied as to the    
resumption of treating new accounts as Automatic Additional Accounts, no new    
accounts that would otherwise be Automatic Additional Accounts shall be treated 
as such on any Addition Date if:                                                

        (i) the aggregate balance of Receivables in Automatic Additional
   Accounts and Supplemental Accounts designated during a twelve month (or
shorter) period beginning on the Additional Limitation Event (or any
    anniversary thereof) would exceed an amount equal to the excess (if any)
     of 20% of the aggregate balance of Receivables determined as of the first
day after the Additional Limitation Event (or such anniversary); or 

         (ii) the aggregate balance of Receivables in Automatic Additional
  Accounts and Supplemental Accounts designated during a three month (or
      shorter) period beginning on the Additional Limitation Event (or the first
day of the third month commencing thereafter or of any ensuing third
      month) would exceed 15% of the aggregate balance of Receivables determined
 as of the first day after the occurrence of the Additional Limitation
Event (or the first day of such third month or ensuing third month).

    (b) REQUIRED ADDITIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL ACCOUNTS. If during any period of
thirty consecutive days, the Transferor Amount averaged over that period is less
than the Minimum Transferor Amount for that period, Transferor shall designate  
additional Eligible Accounts ("SUPPLEMENTAL ACCOUNTS") to be included as        
Accounts in a sufficient amount such that the average of the Transferor Amount, 
computed by assuming that the amount of the Principal Receivables of such       
Supplemental Accounts shall be deemed to be outstanding in the Trust during each
day of such 30-day period, is at least equal to the Minimum Transferor Amount.  
In addition, if on any Business Day the aggregate amount of Principal           
Receivables plus amounts on deposit in the Excess Funding Account is less than  
the Required Principal Balance, Transferor                                      

35

P-->EX-4.642nd Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 42nd
shall designate Supplemental Accounts from any Approved Portfolio to be included
as Accounts in a sufficient amount such that the aggregate amount of Principal  
Receivables plus amounts on deposit in the Excess Funding Account will be equal 
to or greater than the Required Principal Balance. Receivables from all such    
Supplemental Accounts shall be transferred to the Trust on or before the fifth  
Business Day following such thirty-day period or Business Day, as the case may  
be. In lieu of, or in addition to, designating Supplemental Accounts as required
above, Transferor may convey to the Trust participations or trust certificates  
representing undivided legal or beneficial interests in a pool of assets        
primarily consisting of receivables arising under revolving credit card accounts
or other revolving credit accounts owned by Transferor or any of its Affiliates 
and collections thereon ("PARTICIPATION INTERESTS"). Any addition of            
Participation Interests to the Trust (whether pursuant to this PARAGRAPH (b) or 
PARAGRAPH (c) below) shall be effected by an amendment hereto, dated the        
applicable Addition Date, pursuant to SUBSECTION 13.1(a).                       

  (c) PERMITTED ADDITIONS. In addition to its obligation under PARAGRAPH
(b), Transferor may, but shall not be obligated to, from time to time designate 
Supplemental Accounts or Participation Interests to be included as Trust Assets,
in either case as of the applicable Addition Date, so long as after giving      
effect to such addition no more than 20% of the Receivables by outstanding      
balance, will be 30 or more days delinquent.                                    

(d) CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR ADDITIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL ACCOUNTS AND   
PARTICIPATION INTERESTS. Transferor agrees that any transfer of Receivables from
Supplemental Accounts or Participation Interests under PARAGRAPHS (b) or (c)    
shall occur only upon satisfaction of the following conditions (to the extent   
applicable):                                                                    

          (i) on or before the tenth Business Day prior to the Addition Date
      (the "NOTICE DATE"), Transferor shall give Trustee, each Rating Agency and
    Servicer written notice that such Supplemental Accounts or Participation
  Interests will be included, which notice shall specify the approximate
aggregate amount of the Receivables or Participation Interests to be
    transferred; and, in the case of any transfer pursuant to PARAGRAPH (c),
the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied;              

            (ii) on or before the Addition Date, Transferor shall have delivered
  to Trustee a written assignment (including an acceptance by Trustee on
behalf of the Trust for the benefit of the Investor Holders) in     
      substantially the form of EXHIBIT A (the "ASSIGNMENT") and the Credit Card
      Originator shall have indicated in its computer files that the Receivables
      created in connection with the Supplemental Accounts have been transferred
    to the Trust and, within five Business Days thereafter, Transferor shall
   have delivered to Trustee an Account Schedule listing such Supplemental
Accounts, which as of the date of such Assignment, shall be deemed  
    incorporated into and made a part of such Assignment and this Agreement;

  (iii) Transferor shall represent and warrant that (x) each
      Supplemental Account is, as of the Addition Date, an Eligible Account, and
     each Receivable in such Supplemental Account is, as of the Addition Date,
      an Eligible Receivable, (y) no selection procedures believed by Transferor
  to be materially adverse to the interests of the Investor Holders were
utilized in selecting the Additional Accounts from the available    

36

  Eligible Accounts in an Approved Portfolio, and (z) as of the Addition
Date, Transferor is not insolvent;                                  

            (iv) Transferor shall represent and warrant that, as of the Addition
Date, the Assignment constitutes either (x) a valid transfer and    
     assignment to the Trust of all right, title and interest of Transferor in
and to the Receivables then existing and thereafter created in the  
     Supplemental Accounts, and all proceeds of such Receivables and Insurance
   Proceeds relating thereto and such Receivables and all proceeds thereof
      and Insurance Proceeds and Recoveries relating thereto will be held by the
    Trust free and clear of any Lien of any Person claiming through or under
     Transferor or any of its Affiliates, except for (i) Liens permitted under
SECTION 2.7(b), (ii) the interest of Transferor as Holder of the    
Transferor Interest and (iii) Transferor's right to receive interest
  accruing on, and investment earnings in respect of, the Excess Funding
Account, or any Series Account as provided in this Agreement and any
     related Supplement or (y) a grant of a security interest in such property
to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Investor Holders, which is   
     enforceable with respect to then existing Receivables in the Supplemental
Accounts, the proceeds thereof and Insurance Proceeds and Recoveries
      relating thereto upon the conveyance of such Receivables to the Trust, and
which will be enforceable with respect to the Receivables thereafter
 created in respect of Supplemental Accounts conveyed on such Addition
     Date, the proceeds thereof and Insurance Proceeds and Recoveries relating
 thereto upon such creation; and (z) if the Assignment constitutes the
  grant of a security interest to the Trustee in such property, upon the
    filing of a financing statement as described in SECTION 2.1 with respect
to such Supplemental Accounts and in the case of the Receivables    
      thereafter created in such Supplemental Accounts and the proceeds thereof,
and Insurance Proceeds and Recoveries relating thereto, upon such   
creation, the Trust shall have a first priority perfected security  
   interest in such property (subject to Section 9-306 of the UCC), except
for Liens permitted under SECTION 2.7(b);                           

        (v) Transferor shall deliver an Officer's Certificate to Trustee
confirming the items set forth in CLAUSE (ii); and                  

           (vi) Transferor shall deliver an Opinion of Counsel with respect to
   the Receivables in the Supplemental Accounts to Trustee (with a copy to
each Rating Agency) substantially in the form of EXHIBIT E-2.       

  (e) ADDITIONAL APPROVED PORTFOLIOS. As of August 21, 2001, each of the
Restatement Date Portfolios is designated as an Approved Portfolio. The         
Transferor may also from time to time designate additional portfolios of        
accounts as "Approved Portfolios" if the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied   
with respect to that designation (except as to any Series or Class that         
expressly waives this requirement in the applicable Supplement). Transferor     
agrees that prior to any transfer of Receivables from Automatic Additional      
Accounts arising in a portfolio that is designated as an Approved Portfolio     
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence Transferor shall satisfy the     
following requirements:

SECTION 2.9. REMOVAL OF ACCOUNTS. (a) On any day of any Monthly Period
Transferor shall have the right to require the reassignment to it or its        
designee of all the Trust's right, title and interest in, to and under the      
Receivables then existing and thereafter created, all moneys due or to become   
due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof in or
with respect to the Accounts then owned by the Credit Card Originator and       
designated by Transferor (the "REMOVED ACCOUNTS") or Participation Interests    
(unless otherwise set forth in the applicable Supplement), upon satisfaction of 
the following conditions:                                                       

         (i) on or before the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the
Removal Date (the "REMOVAL NOTICE DATE") Transferor shall have given
Trustee, Servicer, each Rating Agency and any Enhancement Provider  
  entitled thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement written notice of
    such removal and specifying the date for removal of the Removed Accounts
      and Participation Interests (the "REMOVAL DATE"); Transferor shall provide
each Rating Agency with such additional information relating to such
removal as the Rating Agency shall reasonably request;              

           (ii) with respect to Removed Accounts, on or prior to the date that
is 10 Business Days after the Removal Date, Transferor shall have   
     delivered to Trustee an Account Schedule listing the Removed Accounts and
specifying for each such Account, as of the Removal Notice Date, its
      account number, the aggregate amount outstanding, and the aggregate amount
of Principal Receivables outstanding in such Account;               

     (iii) with respect to Removed Accounts, Transferor shall have
     represented and warranted as of the Removal Date that the list of Removed
     Accounts delivered pursuant to PARAGRAPH (ii), as of the Removal Date, is
true and complete in all material respects;                         

           (iv) with respect to any removal pursuant to SECTION 2.9(b) that is
   being made as a result of the applicable Merchant exercising a purchase
   right as to which Transferor has no reasonable control (an "INVOLUNTARY
    REMOVAL"), Transferor shall use reasonable efforts to satisfy the Rating
      Agency Condition; and as to any other removal, the Rating Agency Condition
shall have been satisfied;                                          

          (v) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee and any Enhancement
      Provider entitled thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement an Officer's
    Certificate, dated as of the Removal Date, to the effect that Transferor
 reasonably believes that (A) in the case of any removal other than an
   Involuntary Removal, such removal will not, based on the facts known to
    such officer at the time of such certification, then or thereafter cause
   an Early Amortization Event to occur with respect to any Series, (B) in
the case of any Involuntary Removal, Transferor has used reasonable 
efforts to avoid having such removal result in an Early Amortization
    Event, (C) in either case, no selection procedure believed by Transferor
      to be materially adverse to the interests of the Investor Holders has been
used in removing Removed Accounts from among any pool of Accounts or
Participation Interests of a similar type (it being understood that 
Transferor will not be                                              

39

P-->EX-4.646th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 46th
      deemed to have used such an adverse selection procedure in connection with
     any Involuntary Removal) and (D) in the case of any Removal other than an
   Involuntary Removal, Accounts (or administratively convenient groups of
 Accounts, such as billing cycles) were chosen for removal on a random
  basis or another basis that the Transferor believes is consistent with
achieving derecognition of the Receivables under generally accepted 
     accounting principles in the United States of America in effect from time
to time;                                                            

       (vi) in the case of any removal pursuant to SECTION 2.9(a), the
    aggregate Principal Receivables in the Removed Accounts shall not exceed
  the lesser of (A) the excess of the Transferor Amount over the Minimum
    Transferor Amount or (B) the excess of the aggregate amount of Principal
      Receivables plus amounts on deposit in the Excess Funding Account over the
Required Principal Balance, all measured as of the end of the most  
recently ended Monthly Period;                                      

        (vii) in the case of any removal pursuant to SECTION 2.9(b), the
     removal shall not cause the Transferor Amount to be less than the Minimum
     Transferor Amount or cause the sum of the aggregate Principal Receivables
plus the Excess Funding Account balance to be less than the Required
Principal Balance; and                                              

        (viii) such removal shall not cause a decrease in the sum of the
Invested Amounts for all outstanding Series.                        

Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, Trustee shall execute and
deliver to Transferor or its designee a written reassignment in substantially   
the form of EXHIBIT B (the "REASSIGNMENT") and shall, without further action, be
deemed to transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to Transferor or its  
designee, effective as of the Removal Date, without recourse, representation or 
warranty, all the right, title and interest of the Trust in and to the          
Receivables arising in the Removed Accounts or the Participation Interests, all 
moneys due and to become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and  
all proceeds thereof. In addition, Trustee shall execute such other documents   
and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such other actions as shall  
reasonably be requested by Transferor to effect the conveyance of Receivables   
pursuant to this Section.                                                       

  (b) Transferor may from time to time designate as Removed Accounts any
Accounts designated for purchase by a Merchant pursuant to the terms of the     
related Credit Card Processing Agreement, PROVIDED THAT no Account included in  
the Identified Portfolio may be designated a Removed Account until the Series   
1996-A and Series 1996-B Certificates have been paid in full pursuant to this   
SECTION 2.9(b). Any Trust's repurchase of the Receivables in Removed Accounts   
designated pursuant to this SECTION 2.9(b) shall be effected in the manner and  
at a price determined in accordance with SECTION 2.5(b), as if the Receivables  
being repurchased were Ineligible Receivables. Amounts deposited in the         
Collection Account in connection therewith shall be deemed to be Collections of 
Principal Receivables and shall be applied in accordance with the terms of      
ARTICLE IV and each Supplement.                                                 

SECTION 2.10. DISCOUNT OPTION. (a) Transferor shall have the option to
designate at any time a fixed or floating percentage (the "DISCOUNT PERCENTAGE")
of the amount of

Receivables arising in the Accounts on or after the date such designation       
becomes effective that would otherwise constitute Principal Receivables (prior  
to subtracting from Principal Receivables, Finance Charge Receivables that are  
Discount Option Receivables) to be treated as Finance Charge Receivables.       
Transferor may from time to time increase (subject to the limitations described 
below), reduce or eliminate the Discount Percentage for Discount Option         
Receivables arising in the Accounts on and after the date of such change.       
Transferor must provide 30 days' prior written notice to Servicer, Trustee and  
each Rating Agency of any such increase, reduction or elimination, and such     
increase, reduction or elimination shall become effective on the date specified 
therein only if (i) Transferor has delivered to Trustee an Officer's Certificate
to the effect that, based on the facts known to such officer at the time,       
Transferor reasonably believes that such increase, reduction or elimination will
not at the time of its occurrence cause an Early Amortization Event, or an event
which with notice or the lapse of time would constitute an Early Amortization   
Event, to occur with respect to any Series and (ii) in the case of any increase,
the Discount Percentage shall not exceed 3% after giving effect to that         
increase, unless the Rating Agency Condition has been satisfied with respect to 
the increase.                                                                   

   (b) On each Date of Processing after the date on which the Transferor's
exercise of its discount option takes effect, the Transferor shall treat        
Discount Option Receivables Collections as Collections of Finance Charge        
Receivables.                                                                    

SECTION 2.11. ADDITIONAL TRANSFERORS. Transferor may designate additional
or substitute Persons to be included as Transferors under this Agreement by an  
amendment to this Agreement (which amendment shall be subject to SECTION 13.1   
and to any applicable restrictions in the Supplement for any outstanding Series)
and, in connection with such designation, the initial Transferor shall transfer 
a portion of the Transferor Interest to such additional Transferor reflecting   
such additional Transferor's interest in the Transferor Interest; PROVIDED THAT 
prior to any such designation and issuance the conditions set forth in SECTION  
6.3(d) shall have been satisfied.                                               

SECTION 2.12. ADDITIONAL CREDIT CARD ORIGINATORS. Transferor may designate
additional Persons as Credit Card Originators under this Agreement by an        
amendment to this Agreement (which amendment shall be subject to SECTION 13.1   
and to any applicable restrictions in the Supplement for any outstanding        
Series).

     (c) Servicer shall not be obligated to use separate servicing procedures,
offices, employees or accounts for servicing the Receivables from the

     (d) Servicer shall comply with and perform its servicing obligations with

coverage insuring against losses through wrongdoing of its officers and

SECTION 3.2. SERVICING COMPENSATION. As full compensation for its   
servicing activities hereunder and as reimbursement for any expense incurred by 
it in connection therewith, Servicer shall be entitled to receive a servicing   
fee (the "SERVICING FEE") with respect to each Monthly Period, payable monthly  
on the related Distribution Date, in an amount equal to one-twelfth of the      
product of (a) the weighted average of the Series Servicing Fee Percentages with
respect to each outstanding Series (based upon the Series Servicing Fee         
Percentage for each Series and the Invested Amount (or such other amount as     
specified in the related Supplement) of such Series, in each case as of the last
day of the prior Monthly Period) and (b) the amount of Principal Receivables on

to the Investor Interest of each Series with respect to any Monthly Period (the 
"INVESTOR SERVICING FEE") will be determined in accordance with the relevant    
Supplement. The portion of the Servicing Fee with respect to any Monthly Period 
not so allocated to the Investor Interest of a particular Series, or otherwise  
allocated in any Supplement, shall be paid from Finance Charge Collections      
allocable to Transferor on the related Distribution Date. In no event shall the 
Trust, Trustee, the Investor Holders of any Series or any Enhancement Provider  
be liable for the share of the Servicing Fee with respect to any Monthly Period 
to be paid by Transferor.                                                       

 SECTION 3.3. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF SERVICER. WFN,
in its capacity as initial Servicer, hereby makes, and any Successor Servicer by
its appointment hereunder shall make, on each Closing Date (and on the date of  
any such appointment), the following representations, warranties and covenants  
to the Trust:                                                                   

(a) ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. Servicer is a national banking  
association (or with respect to such Successor Servicer, such other corporate   
entity as may be applicable) duly organized, validly existing and in good       
standing under the laws of the United States, and has full corporate power,     
authority and legal right to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under 
this Agreement and each Supplement and, in all material respects, to own its    
properties and conduct its business as such properties are presently owned and  
as such business is presently conducted.                                        

      (b) DUE QUALIFICATION. Servicer is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation (or is exempt from such requirements),   
and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction in   
which failure to so qualify or to obtain such licenses and approvals would have 
a material adverse effect on the interests of the Investor Holders hereunder or 
under any Supplement.                                                           

   (c) DUE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery, and performance of this
Agreement and each Supplement have been duly authorized by Servicer by all      
necessary corporate action on the part of Servicer.                             

    (d) BINDING OBLIGATION. This Agreement and each Supplement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Servicer, enforceable in accordance with 
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,    
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereinafter 
in effect, affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights in general (or with   
respect to such Successor Servicer, such other corporate entity as may be       
applicable) and except as such enforceability may be limited by general         
principles of equity (whether considered in a suit at law or in equity).        

   (e) NO VIOLATION. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each
Supplement by Servicer, the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each Supplement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof and       
thereof applicable to Servicer, will not conflict with, violate, result in any  
breach of any of the material terms and provisions of, or constitute (with or   
without notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under, any          
Requirement of Law applicable to Servicer or any indenture, contract, agreement,
mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument to which Servicer is a party or by  
which it or any of its properties are bound.                                    

43

P-->EX-4.650th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 50th
      (f) NO PROCEEDINGS. There are no proceedings or investigations pending or,
to the best knowledge of Servicer, threatened against Servicer before any court,
regulatory body, administrative agency or other tribunal or governmental        
instrumentality seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates or the      
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any   
Supplement, seeking any determination or ruling that, in the reasonable judgment
of Servicer, would materially and adversely affect the performance by Servicer  
of its obligations under this Agreement or any Supplement, or seeking any       
determination or ruling that would materially and adversely affect the validity 
or enforceability of this Agreement or any Supplement.                          

    (g) COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. Servicer shall duly satisfy all
obligations on its part to be fulfilled under or in connection with the         
Receivables and the related Accounts, will maintain in effect all qualifications
required under Requirements of Law in order to properly service the Receivables 
and the related Accounts and will comply in all material respects with all other
Requirements of Law in connection with servicing the Receivables and the related
Accounts, the failure to comply with which would have a material adverse effect 
on the interests of the Investor Holders.                                       

(h) NO RESCISSION OR CANCELLATION. Servicer shall not permit any    
rescission or cancellation of a Receivable except as ordered by a court of      
competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority or in the ordinary course
of its business and in accordance with the Credit Card Guidelines. Servicer     
shall reflect any such rescission or cancellation in its computer file of       
revolving credit card accounts. In addition, Servicer may waive the accrual     
and/or payment of certain Finance Charge Receivables in respect of certain past 
due Accounts, the Obligors of which have enrolled with a consumer credit        
counseling service, and the Receivables in such Accounts shall not fail to be   
Eligible Receivables solely as a result of such waiver.                         

   (i) PROTECTION OF HOLDERS' RIGHTS. Servicer shall take no action which,
nor omit to take any action the omission of which, would materially impair the  
rights of Holders in any Receivable or Account, nor shall it, except in the     
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with the Credit Card          
Guidelines, reschedule, revise or defer Collections due on the Receivables.     

(j) RECEIVABLES NOT TO BE EVIDENCED BY PROMISSORY NOTES. Except in  
connection with its enforcement or collection of an Account, Servicer will take 
no action to cause any Receivable to be evidenced by any instrument, other than 
an instrument that, taken together with one or more other writings, constitutes 
chattel paper and, if any Receivable is so evidenced (whether or not in         
connection with the enforcement or collection of an Account), it shall be       
reassigned or assigned to Servicer as provided in this Section.                 

      (k) ALL CONSENTS REQUIRED. All approvals, authorizations, consents, orders
or other actions of any Person or of any governmental body or official required 
in connection with the execution and delivery by Servicer of this Agreement and 
each Supplement, the performance by Servicer of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each Supplement and the fulfillment by Servicer of the terms 
hereof and thereof, have been obtained; PROVIDED that Servicer makes no         
representation or warranty as to state securities or "blue sky" laws.           

44

P-->EX-4.651st Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 51st
    (l) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS AND BOOKS OF ACCOUNT. Servicer shall maintain
and implement administrative and operating procedures (including the ability to 
recreate records evidencing the Receivables in the event of the destruction of  
the originals thereof), and keep and maintain all documents, books, computer    
records and other information, reasonably necessary or advisable for the        
collection of all the Receivables. Such documents, books and computer records   
shall reflect all facts giving rise to the Receivables, all payments and credits
with respect thereto, and, to the extent required pursuant to SECTION 2.1, such 
documents, books and computer records shall indicate the interests of the Trust 
in the Receivables.                                                             

For purposes of the representations and warranties set forth in this
SECTION 3.3, each reference to a Supplement shall be deemed to refer only to    
those Supplements in effect as of the relevant Closing Date or the date of      
appointment of a Successor Servicer, as applicable.                             

If any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Servicer  
contained in PARAGRAPH (g), (h), (i) or (j) with respect to any Receivable or   
the related Account is breached, and as a result of such breach the Trust's     
rights in, to or under any Receivables in the related Account or the proceeds of
such Receivables are materially impaired or such proceeds are not available for 
any reason to the Trust free and clear of any Lien, then no later than the      
expiration of 60 days (or such longer period, not in excess of 150 days, as may 
be agreed to by Trustee) from the earlier to occur of the discovery of such     
event by Servicer, or receipt by Servicer of notice of such event given by      
Trustee, all Receivables in the Account or Accounts to which such event relates 
shall be reassigned or assigned to Servicer as set forth below; PROVIDED that   
such Receivables will not be reassigned or assigned to Servicer if, on any day  
prior to the end of such 60-day or longer period, (i) the relevant              
representation and warranty shall be true and correct, or the relevant covenant 
shall have been complied with, in all material respects and (ii) Servicer shall 
have delivered an Officer's Certificate describing the nature of such breach and
the manner in which such breach was cured.                                      

Servicer shall effect such assignment by making a deposit into the  
Collection Account in immediately available funds prior to the next succeeding  
Business Day in an amount equal to the amount of such Receivables, which deposit
shall be considered a Collection with respect to such Receivables and shall be  
applied in accordance with ARTICLE IV and each Supplement.                      

   Upon each such assignment to Servicer, Trustee, on behalf of the Trust,
shall automatically and without further action be deemed to transfer, assign,   
set over and otherwise convey to Servicer, without recourse, representation or  
warranty (except for the warranty that since the date of transfer by Transferor,
Trustee has not sold, transferred or encumbered any such Receivables or interest
therein), all right, title and interest of the Trust in and to such Receivables,
all moneys due or to become due and all amounts received with respect thereto   
and all proceeds thereof. Trustee shall execute such documents and instruments  
of transfer or assignment and take such other actions as shall be reasonably    
requested by Servicer to effect the conveyance of any such Receivables pursuant 
to this Section. The obligation of Servicer to accept assignment of such        
Receivables, and to make the deposits, if any, required to be made to the Excess
Funding Account or the Collection Account as provided in the preceding          
paragraph, shall constitute the sole remedy respecting the event giving rise to 
such obligation available to Holders (or Trustee on behalf of Holders) or any   
Enhancement Provider.

applied certain procedures agreed upon with Servicer to compare the mathematical
calculations of certain amounts set forth in Servicer's Certificates delivered  
pursuant to SECTION 3.4(c) during the period covered by such report with        
Servicer's computer reports which were the source of such amounts and that on   
the basis of such agreed upon procedures and comparison, such amounts are in    
agreement, except for such exceptions as they believe to be immaterial and such 
other exceptions as shall be set forth in such statement. A copy of such report 
shall be delivered to each Enhancement Provider, if any, entitled thereto       
pursuant to the relevant Supplement.                                            

  (c) A copy of each certificate and report provided pursuant to SECTION
3.4(c), 3.5 or 3.6 may be obtained by any Investor Holder or Certificate Owner  
by a request to Trustee addressed to the Corporate Trust Office.                

(d) In the event such firm rendering a report under this Section 3.6
requires the Trustee to agree to the procedures performed by such firm, the     
Servicer shall direct the Trustee in writing to so agree; it being understood   
and agreed that the Trustee will deliver such letter of agreement in conclusive 
reliance upon the direction of the Servicer, and the Trustee makes no           
independent inquiry or investigation as to, and shall have no obligation or     
liability in respect of, the sufficiency, validity or correctness of such       
procedures.                                                                     

SECTION 3.7. TAX TREATMENT. Transferor has entered into this Agreement,
and the Certificates will be issued, with the intention that for Federal, state 
and local income and franchise tax purposes, the Investor Certificates (except  
Transferor Retained Certificates which are held by Transferor) of each Series   
will qualify as debt secured by the Receivables. Transferor, by entering into   
this Agreement, each Holder, by the acceptance of its Certificate (and each     
Certificate Owner, by its acceptance of an interest in the applicable           
Certificate), agree to treat such Investor Certificates for Federal, state and  
local income and franchise tax purposes as debt. Each Holder of such Investor   
Certificate agrees that it will cause any Certificate owner acquiring an        
interest in a Certificate through it to comply with this Agreement as to        
treatment as debt under applicable tax law, as described in this SECTION 3.7.   
Furthermore, subject to SECTION 11.11, or unless Transferor shall determine that
the filing of returns is appropriate, Trustee shall                             

47

P-->EX-4.654th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 54th
treat the Trust solely as a security device and not as an entity separate from  
the Transferor and shall not file tax returns or obtain an employer             
identification number on behalf of the Trust.                                   

SECTION 3.8. NOTICES TO TRANSFEROR. If WFN is no longer acting as   
Servicer, any Successor Servicer shall deliver to Transferor each certificate   
and report required to be provided thereafter pursuant to SECTION 3.4(c), 3.5 or
3.6.                                                                            

SECTION 3.9. ADJUSTMENTS. (a) If Servicer adjusts downward the amount of
any Receivable because of a rebate, refund, unauthorized charge or billing error
to an accountholder, or because such Receivable was created in respect of       
merchandise which was refused or returned by an accountholder, or if Servicer   
otherwise adjusts downward the amount of any Receivable without receiving       
Collections therefor or charging off such amount as uncollectible ("MERCHANT    
ADJUSTMENT PAYMENTS"), then, in any such case, the amount of Principal          
Receivables used to calculate the Transferor Interest or the Investor           
Percentages applicable to any Series will be reduced by the amount of the       
adjustment. Similarly, the amount of Principal Receivables used to calculate the
Transferor Amount and the Investor Percentages applicable to any Series will be 
reduced by the amount of any Principal Receivable which was discovered as having
been created through a fraudulent or counterfeit charge or with respect to which
the covenant of Transferor contained in SECTION 2.7(b) has been breached. Any   
adjustment required pursuant to either of the two preceding sentences shall be  
made on the first Business Day after the Date of Processing for the event giving
rise to such adjustment. If, following the exclusion of such Principal          
Receivables from the calculation of the Transferor Amount, the Transferor Amount
would be less than the Specified Transferor Amount, not later than the close of 
business on such first Business Day, Transferor shall make a deposit into the   
Excess Funding Account in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the 
amount by which the Transferor Amount would be less than the Specified          
Transferor Amount (up to the amount of such Principal Receivables). Any amount  
deposited into the Excess Funding Account pursuant to the preceding sentence    
shall be considered Collections of Principal Receivables and shall be applied in
accordance with ARTICLE IV and each Supplement.                                 

      (b) If (i) Servicer makes a deposit into the Collection Account in respect
of a Collection of a Receivable and such Collection was received by Servicer in 
the form of a check which is not honored for any reason or (ii) Servicer makes a
mistake with respect to the amount of any Collection and deposits an amount that
is less than or more than the actual amount of such Collection, Servicer shall  
appropriately adjust the amount subsequently deposited into the Collection      
Account to reflect such dishonored check or mistake. Any Receivable in respect  
of which a dishonored check is received shall be deemed not to have been paid.  
Notwithstanding the first two sentences of this paragraph, any adjustments made 
pursuant to this paragraph will be reflected in a current report but will not   
change any amount of Collections previously reported pursuant to SECTION 3.4(c).

ARTICLE IV RIGHTS OF HOLDERS; ALLOCATIONS 

SECTION 4.1. RIGHTS OF HOLDERS. The Investor Certificates shall represent
fractional undivided interests in the Trust, which, with respect to each Series,
shall consist of the right to receive, to the extent necessary to make the      
required payments with respect to the Investor Certificates of such Series at   
the times and in the amounts specified in the related Supplement,               

48

P-->EX-4.655th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 55th
the portion of Collections allocable to Investor Holders of such Series pursuant
to this Agreement and such Supplement, funds on deposit in the Collection       
Account allocable to Holders of such Series pursuant to this Agreement and such 
Supplement, funds on deposit in any related Series Account and funds available  
pursuant to any related Enhancement (the "INVESTOR INTEREST"), it being         
understood that, unless otherwise specified in the Supplements with respect to  
each affected Series, the Investor Certificates of any Series or Class shall not
represent any interest in any Series Account or Enhancement for the benefit of  
any other Series or Class. The Transferor shall own the remaining interest in   
the Trust Assets not allocated pursuant to this Agreement or any Supplement to  
the Investor Interest (the "TRANSFEROR INTEREST"), including the right to       
receive Collections with respect to the Receivables and other amounts at the    
times and in the amounts specified in this Agreement or any Supplement to be    
paid on account of the Transferor Interest; PROVIDED that (x) the Transferor    
Interest shall not represent any interest in the Collection Account, any Series 
Account or any Enhancement, except as specifically provided in this Agreement or
any Supplement and (y) if this Agreement or, in the case of Supplemental        
Accounts, the related Assignment is deemed to constitute a grant to the Trustee,
for the benefit of the Investor Holders, of a security interest in the          
Receivables and other Trust Assets, then the Transferor Interest shall be deemed
to represent Transferor's equity in the collateral granted.                     

SECTION 4.2. ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLECTION ACCOUNT AND EXCESS FUNDING 
ACCOUNT. Servicer, for the benefit of the Holders, shall establish and maintain 
in the name of Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, two Eligible Deposit Accounts   
(the "COLLECTION ACCOUNT" and the "EXCESS FUNDING ACCOUNT"), each bearing a     
designation clearly indicating that the funds deposited therein are held for the
benefit of the Holders. The Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account   
shall initially be established with Trustee. Trustee shall possess all right,   
title and interest in all funds on deposit from time to time in the Collection  
Account and the Excess Funding Account and in all proceeds thereof for the      
benefit of the Holders. The Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account   
shall be under the sole dominion and control of Trustee for the benefit of the  
Holders. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Trustee agrees that it 
shall have no right of set-off or banker's lien against, and no right to        
otherwise deduct from, any funds held in the Collection Account or the Excess   
Funding Account for any amount owed to it by the Trust, any Holder or any       
Enhancement Provider. If at any time the Collection Account or the Excess       
Funding Account ceases to be an Eligible Deposit Account, Trustee (or Servicer  
on its behalf) shall within 10 Business Days (or such longer period, not to     
exceed 30 calendar days, as to which the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied)  
establish a new Eligible Deposit Account meeting the conditions specified above 
and transfer any cash or any investments from the affected account to such new  
account, and from the date such new account is established, it shall be the     
"Collection Account" or the "Excess Funding Account," as the case may be.       

     Funds on deposit in the Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account
shall, at the direction of Servicer, be invested by Trustee in Eligible         
Investments selected by Servicer, except that funds on deposit in either such   
account on any Transfer Date need not be invested through the immediately       
following Distribution Date. All such Eligible Investments shall be held by     
Trustee for the benefit of the Holders. Trustee shall maintain for the benefit  
of the Holders possession of the negotiable instruments or securities, if any,  
evidencing such Eligible Investments. Investments of funds representing         
Collections collected during any Monthly Period shall be invested in Eligible   
Investments that will mature so that all funds will be available at the         

49

P-->EX-4.656th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 56th
close of business on the Transfer Date following such Monthly Period. No        
Eligible Investment shall be disposed of prior to its maturity unless Servicer  
so directs and either (i) such disposal will not result in a loss of all or part
of the principal portion of such Eligible Investment or (ii) prior to the       
maturity of such Eligible Investment, a default occurs in the payment of        
principal, interest or any other amount with respect to such Eligible           
Investment. On each Distribution Date, all interest and other investment        
earnings (net of losses and investment expenses) on funds on deposit in the     
Collection Account and the Excess Funding Account shall be treated as           
Collections of Finance Charge Receivables with respect to the last day of the   
related Monthly Period, except as otherwise specified in any Supplement. For    
purposes of determining the availability of funds or the balances in the        
Collection Account or the Excess Funding Account for any reason under this      
Agreement, all investment earnings net of investment expenses and losses on such
funds shall be deemed not to be available or on deposit. In no event shall the  
Trustee be liable for the selection of investments or for investment losses     
incurred thereon. The Trustee shall have no liability in respect of losses      
incurred as a result of the liquidation of any such investment prior to its     
stated maturity or the failure of the party directing such investment to provide
timely written investment direction. The Trustee shall have no obligation to    
invest or reinvest any amounts held hereunder in the absence of such written    
investment direction.                                                           

 Unless otherwise directed by Servicer, funds on deposit in the Excess
Funding Account will be withdrawn and paid to Transferor on any day to the      
extent that the Transferor Amount exceeds the Specified Transferor Amount on    
such day. On any Transfer Date on which one or more Series is in an Amortization
Period, Servicer shall determine the aggregate amounts of Principal Shortfalls, 
if any, with respect to each such Series that is a Principal Sharing Series     
(after giving effect to the allocation and payment provisions in the Supplement 
with respect to each such Series), and Servicer shall instruct Trustee to       
withdraw such amount from the Excess Funding Account (up to an amount equal to  
the lesser of (x) the amount on deposit in the Excess Funding Account after     
application of the preceding sentence on that day and (y) the amount, if any, by
which the Transferor Amount would be less than zero if there were no funds on   
deposit in the Excess Funding Account on that day) on such Transfer Date and    
allocate such amount among each such Series as specified in each related        
Supplement.                                                                     

SECTION 4.3. COLLECTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS. (a) Servicer shall apply, or
instruct Trustee to apply, all funds on deposit in the Collection Account as    
described in this ARTICLE IV and in each Supplement. Except as otherwise        
provided below and in each Supplement, Servicer shall deposit Collections into  
the Collection Account no later than the second Business Day following the Date 
of Processing of such Collections. Except as otherwise required by any          
Supplement, Transferor may permit or require payments owed by any Merchant with 
respect to In-Store Payments to be netted against amounts owed by the Credit    
Card Originator to that Merchant, and Transferor shall require the Credit Card  
Originator to deposit into the Collection Account on each Business Day an amount
equal to the aggregate amount of In-Store Payments netted against amounts owed  
by the Credit Card Originator to the various Merchants on that Business Day.    

Subject to the express terms of any Supplement, but notwithstanding 
anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, if WFN remains Servicer and (x)
for so long as WFN maintains a short term debt rating of A-1 or better by S&P,  
P-1 or better by Moody's, if rated by Fitch, F1 or better by Fitch, and, if     
rated by any other Rating Agency, the equivalent rating by that Rating Agency   
(or such other rating below A-1, P-1 or such equivalent rating, as the case may 
be, which                                                                       

50

P-->EX-4.657th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 57th
is satisfactory to each Rating Agency, if any), (y) with respect to Collections 
allocable to any Series, any other conditions specified in the related          
Supplement are satisfied or (z) WFN has provided to Trustee a letter of credit, 
surety bond or other similar arrangement covering collection risk of Servicer   
and in each case acceptable to each Rating Agency (as evidenced by a letter from
each Rating Agency to the effect that the Rating Agency Condition has been      
satisfied), if any, Servicer need not make the daily deposits of Collections    
into the Collection Account as provided in the preceding paragraph, but may make
a single deposit in the Collection Account in immediately available funds not   
later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the related Transfer Date.        

     (b) On each Date of Processing, Collections of Finance Charge Receivables
and of Principal Receivables shall be allocated to the Investor Interest of each
Series in accordance with the related Supplement. On each Determination Date,   
Defaulted Receivables will be allocated to the Investor Interest of each Series 
in accordance with the related Supplement.                                      

     (c) Throughout the existence of the Trust, unless otherwise stated in any
Supplement, on each Date of Processing Servicer shall allocate to Transferor an 
amount equal to the product of (A) the Transferor Percentage and (B) the        
aggregate amount of Collections allocated to Principal Receivables and Finance  
Charge Receivables, respectively, on that Date of Processing; PROVIDED that, if 
the Transferor Amount (determined after giving effect to any transfer of        
Principal Receivables to the Trust on such date), is less than or equal to the  
Specified Transferor Amount, Servicer shall not allocate to Transferor any such 
amounts that otherwise would be allocated to Transferor, but shall instead      
deposit such funds in the Excess Funding Account. Unless otherwise stated in any
Supplement, neither Servicer nor Transferor need deposit any amounts allocated  
to the Transferor pursuant to the foregoing into the Collection Account and     
shall pay, or be deemed to pay, such amounts as collected to Transferor.        

     The payments to be made to Transferor, pursuant to this SECTION 4.3(c) do
not apply to deposits to the Collection Account or other amounts that do not    
represent Collections, including payment of the purchase price for Receivables  
pursuant to SECTION 2.6 or 10.1, proceeds from the sale, disposition or         
liquidation of Receivables pursuant to SECTION 9.2 or 12.2 or payment of the    
purchase price for the Investor Interest of a specific Series pursuant to the   
related Supplement.                                                             

SECTION 4.4. SHARED PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS. On each Business Day, Shared
Principal Collections may, at the option of Transferor, be applied (or held in  
the Collection Account for later application) as principal with respect to any  
Variable Interest or, so long as either no Series is in an Amortization Period  
or no Series that is in an Amortization Period will have a Principal Shortfall  
on the related Transfer Date (assuming no Early Amortization Event occurs),     
withdrawn from the Collection Account and paid to Transferor; and on each       
Transfer Date, (a) Servicer shall allocate Shared Principal Collections not     
previously so applied or paid to each applicable Principal Sharing Series, pro  
rata, in proportion to the Principal Shortfalls, if any, with respect to each   
such Series, and any remainder may, at the option of Transferor, be applied as  
principal with respect to any Variable Interest and (b) Servicer shall withdraw 
from the Collection Account and pay to Transferor any amounts representing      
Shared Principal Collections remaining after the allocations and applications   
referred to in CLAUSE (a); PROVIDED that, if, on any day the Transferor Amount  
(determined after giving effect to any transfer of Principal Receivables to the 
Trust on such day), is less than or equal to the Specified Transferor Amount,   

51

P-->EX-4.658th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 58th
Servicer shall not distribute to Transferor any Shared Principal Collections    
that otherwise would be distributed to Transferor, but shall deposit such funds 
in the Excess Funding Account to the extent required so that the Transferor     
Amount equals the Specified Transferor Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,   
during any Amortization Period for any Series (other than a Variable Interest), 
Transferor may not apply Shared Principal Collections as principal with respect 
to any Variable Interest, unless such application of principal is made on any   
Transfer Date or related Distribution Date after the application of Shared      
Principal Collections pursuant to the various Supplements.                      

SECTION 4.5. EXCESS FINANCE CHARGE COLLECTIONS. On each Transfer Date, (a)
for each Group, Servicer shall allocate the aggregate amount for all outstanding
Series in such Group of the amounts which the related Supplements specify are to
be treated as "Excess Finance Charge Collections" for such Transfer Date to each
Series in such Group, pro rata, in proportion to the Finance Charge Shortfalls, 
if any, with respect to each such Series, and (b) Servicer shall on the related 
Distribution Date withdraw (or shall instruct Trustee in writing to withdraw)   
from the Collection Account and pay to Transferor an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (x) the aggregate amount for all outstanding Series in a Group of the
amounts which the related Supplements specify are to be treated as "Excess      
Finance Charge Collections" for such Distribution Date over (y) the aggregate   
amount for all outstanding Series in such Group which the related Supplements   
specify are "Finance Charge Shortfalls", for such Distribution Date.            

 THE REMAINDER OF ARTICLE IV IS RESERVED AND SHALL BE SPECIFIED IN ANY
SUPPLEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY SERIES                                           

ARTICLE V DISTRIBUTIONS AND REPORTS 
     DISTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE MADE TO, AND REPORTS SHALL BE PROVIDED TO, HOLDERS
AS SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE SUPPLEMENT.                                      

ARTICLE VI THE CERTIFICATES 

SECTION 6.1. THE CERTIFICATES. The Investor Certificates of any Series or
Class may be issued in bearer form ("BEARER CERTIFICATES") with attached        
interest coupons and any other applicable coupon (collectively, the "COUPONS")  
or in fully registered form ("REGISTERED CERTIFICATES") and shall be            
substantially in the form of the exhibits with respect thereto attached to the  
applicable Supplement. Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 6.3 or in any    
Supplement, Bearer Certificates shall be issued in minimum denominations of

any Supplement, the Investor Certificates of any Series or Class shall be issued
upon initial issuance as a single certificate evidencing the aggregate original 
principal amount of such Series or Class as described in SECTION 6.13. Each     
Certificate shall be executed by manual or facsimile signature on behalf of     
Transferor by its President, Treasurer or any Vice President. Certificates      
bearing the manual or facsimile signature of an individual who was, at the time 
when such signature was affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of Transferor     
shall not be rendered invalid, notwithstanding that such individual ceased to be
so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or  
does not hold such office at the date of such Certificates. No Certificates     
shall be entitled to any benefit under this                                     

52

Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such Certificate
a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein   
executed by or on behalf of Trustee by the manual or facsimile signature of a   
duly authorized signatory, and such certificate of authentication upon any      
Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such      
Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Bearer         
Certificates shall be dated the applicable Closing Date. All Registered         
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication.                   

SECTION 6.2. AUTHENTICATION OF CERTIFICATES. Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver the Investor Certificates of each Series and Class that are issued  
upon original issuance to or upon the order of Transferor against payment to    
Transferor of the purchase price therefor. If specified in the related          
Supplement for any Series or Class, Trustee shall authenticate and deliver      
outside the United States the Global Certificate that is issued upon original   
issuance thereof.                                                               

SECTION 6.3. NEW ISSUANCES. (a) Transferor may from time to time direct
Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, to authenticate one or more new Series of      
Investor Certificates. The Investor Certificates of all outstanding Series shall
be equally and ratably entitled as provided herein to the benefits of this      
Agreement without preference, priority or distinction, all in accordance with   
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the applicable Supplement except,
with respect to any Series or Class, as provided in the related Supplement.     

    (b) On or before the Closing Date for any new Series, the parties hereto
will execute and deliver a Supplement specifying the Principal Terms of the new 
Series. Such Supplement may modify or amend the terms of this Agreement solely  
as applied to the new Series and may grant the Holders of the Investor          
Certificates in that Series, or an agent or other representative of such        
Holders, notice and consultation rights with respect to any rights or actions of
Trustee. Trustee's obligation to authenticate the Investor Certificates of a new
Series and to execute and deliver the related Supplement is subject to the      
satisfaction of the following conditions (except that the conditions set forth  
in CLAUSES (i), (iii), (iv) and (v) shall not be applicable to the issuance of  
the first Series):                                                              

         (i) on or before the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the
    Closing Date, Transferor shall have given Trustee, Servicer, each Rating
Agency and any Enhancement Provider entitled thereto pursuant to the
relevant Supplement notice of such issuance and the Closing Date;   

   (ii) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee the related
Supplement, executed by each party hereto other than Trustee;       

    (iii) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee any related
     Enhancement Agreement executed by each of the parties thereto, other than
Trustee;                                                            

       (iv) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with
respect to such issuance;                                           

          (v) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee and any Enhancement
      Provider entitled thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement an Officer's
Certificate, dated the                                              

53

      applicable Closing Date, to the effect that Transferor reasonably believes
    that such issuance will not, based on the facts known to such officer at
the time of such certification, then or thereafter cause an Early   
Amortization Event to occur with respect to any Series;             

       (vi) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee and each Rating
Agency a Tax Opinion, dated the Closing Date, with respect to such  
issuance; and                                                       

     (vii) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee an Officer's
     Certificate stating that (A) the Transferor Amount shall not be less than
     the Minimum Transferor Amount and (B) the aggregate Principal Receivables
plus the Excess Funding Account balance shall not be less than the  
     Required Principal Balance, in each case as of the Closing Date and after
giving effect to such issuance.                                     

Upon satisfaction of the above conditions, Trustee shall execute the Supplement 
and authenticate the Investor Certificates of such Series upon execution thereof
by Transferor.                                                                  

     (c) Transferor may from time to time transfer a portion of the Transferor
Interest by causing the issuance of one or more additional interests (each a    
"SUPPLEMENTAL INTEREST"), which may be in certificated or uncertificated form.  
The form and terms of any Supplemental Interest shall be defined in a Supplement
(which Supplement shall be subject to SECTION 13.1(a) to the extent that it     
amends any of the terms of this Agreement), to be delivered to or upon the order
of Transferor (or the Holder of a Supplemental Interest, in the case of the     
transfer or exchange thereof, as provided below), upon satisfaction of the      
following conditions:                                                           

      (i) the Rating Agency Condition shall have been satisfied with
respect to such action; and                                         

       (ii) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee and each Rating
      Agency a Tax Opinion, dated the date of such action (or transfer, exchange
or other disposition as provided below), with respect thereto and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such action, assignment,      
    participation, pledge or other disposition does not require registration
of the interest under the Securities Act or any state securities law
    except for any such registration that has been duly completed and become
effective.                                                          

Any Supplemental Interest may be transferred or exchanged, and the Transferor   
Interest may be pledged, only upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  
CLAUSE (ii).                                                                    

      (d) The Transferor Interest may be transferred in its entirety to a Person
which is a member of the "affiliated group" as defined in Section 1504(a) of the
Code which WFN is a member without the consent or approval of the Holders of the
Investor Certificates, provided that (i) the Rating Agency Condition shall have 
been satisfied with respect to such transfer, (ii) Transferor shall have        
delivered to Trustee and each Rating Agency Opinions of Counsel of the type     
described in SECTION 6.3(c)(ii), dated the date of such transfer, with respect  
thereto and (iii) Transferor shall have delivered to Trustee an Officer's       
Certificate stating that the Transferor Amount shall not be less than the       
Minimum Transferor Amount. In connection with any such transfer, the Person to  
whom the Transferor Interest is transferred will, by its acquisition and        

54

holding of its interest in the Transferor Interest, assume all of the rights and
obligations of Transferor as described in this Agreement and in any Supplement  
or amendment thereto (including the right under this PARAGRAPH (d) with respect 
to subsequent transfers the Transferor Interest).                               

 SECTION 6.4. REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a)
Trustee shall cause to be kept at the office or agency to be maintained in      
accordance with the provisions of SECTION 11.16 a register (the "CERTIFICATE    
REGISTER") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
a transfer agent and registrar (which may be Trustee) (the "TRANSFER AGENT AND  
REGISTRAR") shall provide for the registration of the Registered Certificates   
and of transfers and exchanges of the Registered Certificates as herein         
provided. The Transfer Agent and Registrar on the Effective Date shall be BNY   
Midwest Trust Company and any co-transfer agent and co-registrar chosen by      
Transferor and acceptable to Trustee, including, if and so long as any Series or
Class is listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and such exchange shall so     
require, a co-transfer agent and co-registrar in Luxembourg. So long as any     
Investor Certificates are outstanding, Transferor shall maintain a Transfer     
Agent and Registrar in New York City. Any reference in this Agreement to the    
Transfer Agent and Registrar shall include any co-transfer agent and            
co-registrar unless the context requires otherwise.                             

 Trustee may revoke such appointment and remove any Transfer Agent and
Registrar if Trustee determines in its sole discretion that such Transfer Agent 
and Registrar failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any     
material respect. Any Transfer Agent and Registrar shall be permitted to resign 
as Transfer Agent and Registrar upon 30 days' notice to Transferor, Trustee and 
Servicer; PROVIDED that such resignation shall not be effective and such        
Transfer Agent and Registrar shall continue to perform its duties as Transfer   
Agent and Registrar until Trustee has appointed a successor Transfer Agent and  
Registrar reasonably acceptable to Transferor.                                  

    Subject to PARAGRAPH (c), upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Registered Certificate at any office or agency of the Transfer Agent and    
Registrar maintained for such purpose, one or more new Registered Certificates  
(of the same Series and Class) in authorized denominations of like aggregate    
fractional undivided interests in the Investor Interest shall be executed,      
authenticated and delivered, in the name of the designated transferee or        
transferees.                                                                    

      At the option of a Registered Holder, Registered Certificates (of the same
Series and Class) may be exchanged for other Registered Certificates of         
authorized denominations of like aggregate fractional undivided interests in the
Investor Interest, upon surrender of the Registered Certificates to be exchanged
at any such office or agency; Registered Certificates, including Registered     
Certificates received in exchange for Bearer Certificates, may not be exchanged 
for Bearer Certificates. At the option of the Holder of a Bearer Certificate,   
subject to applicable laws and regulations, Bearer Certificates may be exchanged
for other Bearer Certificates or Registered Certificates (of the same Series and
Class) of authorized denominations of like aggregate fractional undivided       
interests in the Investor Interest, upon surrender of the Bearer Certificates to
be exchanged at an office or agency of the Transfer Agent and Registrar located 
outside the United States. Each Bearer Certificate surrendered pursuant to this 
Section shall have attached thereto all unmatured Coupons; PROVIDED that any    
Bearer Certificate, so surrendered after the close of business on the Record    
Date preceding the relevant payment date or distribution date                   

55

P-->EX-4.662nd Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 62nd
after the expected final payment date need not have attached the Coupon relating
to such payment date or distribution date (in each case, as specified in the    
applicable Supplement).                                                         

Whenever any Investor Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, 
Transferor shall execute, Trustee shall authenticate and the Transfer Agent and 
Registrar shall deliver (in the case of Bearer Certificates, outside the United 
States) the Investor Certificates which the Investor Holder making the exchange 
is entitled to receive. Every Investor Certificate presented or surrendered for 
registration of transfer or exchange shall be accompanied by a written          
instrument of transfer in a form satisfactory to Trustee or the Transfer Agent  
and Registrar duly executed by the Investor Holder or the attorney-in-fact      
thereof duly authorized in writing.                                             

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or 
exchange of Investor Certificates, but the Transfer Agent and Registrar may     
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any such transfer or exchange.                

 All Investor Certificates (together with any Coupons) surrendered for
registration of transfer and exchange or for payment shall be canceled and      
disposed of in a manner satisfactory to Trustee. Trustee shall cancel and       
destroy any Global Certificate upon its exchange in full for Definitive         
Euro-Certificates and shall deliver a certificate of destruction to Transferor. 
Such certificate shall also state that a certificate or certificates of a       
foreign Clearing Agency to the effect required by the applicable Supplement was 
received with respect to each portion of the Global Certificate exchanged for   
Definitive Euro-Certificates.                                                   

   Transferor shall execute and deliver to Trustee Bearer Certificates and
Registered Certificates in such amounts and at such times as are necessary to   
enable Trustee to fulfill its responsibilities under this Agreement, each       
Supplement and the Certificates.                                                

    (b) The Transfer Agent and Registrar will maintain at its expense in the
City of New York and an office or agency where Investor Certificates may be     
surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange (except that Bearer        
Certificates may not be surrendered for exchange at any such office or agency in
the United States). If and so long as any Series or Class is listed on the      
Luxembourg Stock Exchange an agent shall be appointed, at the Servicer's        
expense, in Luxembourg.                                                         

      (c) (i) Registration of transfer of Investor Certificates containing (x) a
legend substantially to the effect set forth on EXHIBIT D-1 shall be effected   
only if such transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement   
under the Securities Act or is exempt from the registration requirements under  
the Securities Act and (y) a legend substantially to the effect set forth on    
EXHIBIT D-3 shall be effected only if such transfer is made to a Person that is 
not (1) an employee benefit plan or other plan, trust or account (including an  
individual retirement account) within the meaning of Section 3.3 of ERISA,      
whether or not subject to ERISA (including, without limitation, Foreign and     
governmental plans) or described by Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue  
Code or (2) any collective investment fund, insurance company separate or       
general account or other entity whose underlying assets include "plan assets" of
the foregoing by reason of an employee benefit plan's or other plan's investment
in such entity (each, a "BENEFIT PLAN") unless it is an insurance company using 
the assets of its general account and, at the time                              

56

P-->EX-4.663rd Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 63rd
of acquisition and throughout its holding of the certificate (a) it is not a    
service provider to the trust or an affiliate of the foregoing, and would not   
otherwise be excluded under 29 C.F.R. 2510.3-101(f)(1), and (b) each of the     
accounts to which such certificate is allocated is an insurance company general 
account (1) that is eligible for and meets the requirements of Department of    
Labor Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 95-60 and (2) of which less than   
25% of the assets are (or represent) assets of a Benefit Plan. If registration  
of a transfer is to be made in reliance upon an exemption from the registration 
requirements under the Securities Act, the transferor or the transferee shall   
deliver, at its expense, to Transferor, Servicer and Trustee, an investment     
letter from the transferee, substantially in the form of the investment         
representation letter attached hereto as EXHIBIT D-2, and no registration of    
transfer shall be made until such letter is so delivered.                       

      Investor Certificates issued upon registration or transfer of, or Investor
Certificates issued in exchange for, Investor Certificates bearing a legend     
referred to above shall also bear such legend unless Transferor, Servicer,      
Trustee and the Transfer Agent and Registrar receive an Opinion of Counsel,     
satisfactory to each of them, to the effect that such legend may be removed.    

     Whenever an Investor Certificate containing a legend referred to above is
presented to the Transfer Agent and Registrar for registration of transfer, the 
Transfer Agent and Registrar shall promptly seek instructions from Servicer     
regarding such transfer and shall be entitled to receive instructions signed by 
a Servicing Officer prior to registering any such transfer. Transferor hereby   
agrees to indemnify the Transfer Agent and Registrar and Trustee and their      
respective officers, directors, agents and employees and to hold each of them   
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or  
bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or   
omitted by them in relation to any such instructions furnished pursuant to this 
paragraph. The preceding sentence shall survive the termination of this         
Agreement and the earlier removal or resignation of the Trustee.                

           (ii) Registration of transfer of Investor Certificates containing a
   legend to the effect set forth on EXHIBIT D-3 shall be effected only if
      such transfer is made to a Person which is not a Benefit Plan, unless such
      Person is an insurance company meeting the specific requirements set forth
  in subsection (i) immediately above. By accepting and holding any such
Investor Certificate, an Investor Holder shall be deemed to have    
represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit Plan, unless such
      Person is an insurance company meeting the specific requirements set forth
in subsection (i) immediately above. By acquiring any interest in a 
  Book-Entry Certificate which contains such legend, a Certificate Owner
      shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not a Benefit
 Plan, unless such Person is an insurance company meeting the specific
requirements set forth in subsection (i) immediately above.         

           (iii) If so requested by Transferor, Trustee will make available to
      any prospective purchaser of Investor Certificates who so requests, a copy
     of a letter provided to Trustee by or on behalf of Transferor relating to
the transferability of any Series or Class to a Benefit Plan.       

      (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any Certificate
for which an Opinion of Counsel has not been issued opining on the treatment of 
such Certificates as debt for

Federal income tax purposes (each, a "SUBJECT CERTIFICATE") shall be subject to 
the following. No transfer (or purported transfer) of all or any part of a      
Subject Certificate (or any economic interest therein), whether to another      
Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder, shall be       
effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer) shall be void AB       
INITIO, and no Person shall otherwise become a Holder of a Subject Certificate  
if (i) at the time of such transfer (or purported transfer) any Subject         
Certificates are traded on an established securities market or readily tradable 
on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof or (ii) after such  
transfer (or purported transfer) (A) the Trust would have more than 95 Holders  
of Subject Certificates and any other interests in the Trust for which an       
Opinion of Counsel is not rendered in connection with the issuance of such      
interest to the effect that such interest will be characterized as debt for     
federal income tax purposes and (B) the Subject Certificates have been issued in
a transaction or transactions that were not required to be registered under the 
Securities Act, and to the extent such offerings or sales were not required to  
be registered under the Securities Act by reason of Regulation S (17 CFR 230.901
through 230.904 or any successor thereto) such offerings or sales would not have
been required to be registered under the Securities Act if the interests so     
offered or sold had been offered and sold within the United States. For purposes
of CLAUSE (i) of the preceding sentence, an established securities market is a  
national securities exchange that is either registered under Section 6 of the   
Exchange Act or exempt from registration because of the limited volume of       
transactions, a foreign securities exchange that, under the law of the          
jurisdiction where it is organized, satisfies regulatory requirements that are  
analogous to the regulatory requirements of the Exchange Act, a regional or     
local exchange, or an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates  
firm buy or sell quotations by identified brokers or dealers by electronic means
or otherwise. For purposes of such CLAUSE (i), Subject Certificates are readily 
tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof if (1)     
Subject Certificates (or interests therein) are regularly quoted by any person, 
such as a broker or dealer, making a market in the interests; (2) any person    
regularly makes available to the public (including customers or subscribers) bid
or offer quotes with respect to Subject Certificates (or interests therein) and 
stands ready to effect buy or sell transactions at the quoted prices for itself 
or on behalf of others; (3) the holders of Subject Certificates have a readily  
available, regular, and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange the Subject     
Certificates (or interests therein) through a public means of obtaining or      
providing information of offers to buy, sell, or exchange such interests; or (4)
prospective buyers and sellers otherwise have the opportunity to buy, sell, or  
exchange Subject Certificates (or interests therein) in a time frame and with   
the regularity and continuity that is comparable to that described in CLAUSES   
(1), (2) and (3) of this sentence. For purposes of determining whether the Trust
will have more than 95 Holders of Subject Certificates, each Person indirectly  
owning an interest in the Trust through a partnership (including any entity     
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes), a grantor trust or an
S corporation (each such entity a "FLOW-THROUGH ENTITY") shall be treated as a  
Holder of a Subject Certificate unless Servicer determines in its sole          
discretion, after consulting with qualified tax counsel, that less than         
substantially all of the value of the beneficial owner's interest in the        
flow-through entity is attributable to the flow-through entity's interest       
(direct or indirect) in the Trust.                                              

SECTION 6.5. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES. If (a) any
mutilated Certificate (together, in the case of Bearer Certificates, with all   
unmatured Coupons (if any) appertaining thereto) is surrendered to the Transfer 
Agent and Registrar, or the Transfer Agent                                      

58

P-->EX-4.665th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 65th
and Registrar receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or 
theft of any Certificate and (b) there is delivered to the Transfer Agent and   
Registrar and Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to  
save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to Trustee that such 
Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, Transferor shall        
execute, Trustee shall authenticate and the Transfer Agent and Registrar shall  
deliver (in the case of Bearer Certificates, outside the United States), in     
exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen        
Certificate, a new Certificate of like tenor and aggregate fractional undivided 
interest. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this     
Section, Trustee or the Transfer Agent and Registrar may require the payment by 
the Holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge    
that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the   
fees and expenses of Trustee and Transfer Agent and Registrar) connected        
therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall      
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust, as if  
originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate     
shall be found at any time.                                                     

SECTION 6.6. PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. Trustee, the Paying Agent, the  
Transfer Agent and Registrar and any agent of any of these may (a) prior to due 
presentation of a Registered Certificate for registration of transfer, treat the
Person in whose name any Registered Certificate is registered as the owner of   
such Registered Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant 
to the applicable Supplement and for all other purposes whatsoever, and (b)     
treat the bearer of a Bearer Certificate or Coupon as the owner of such Bearer  
Certificate or Coupon for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to the
applicable Supplement and for all other purposes whatsoever; and, in any such   
case, neither Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and Registrar nor   
any agent of any of these shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.      
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in determining whether the Holders of the        
requisite Investor Certificates have given any request, demand, authorization,  
direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Certificates owned by           
Transferor, Servicer, any Holder of the Transferor Interest, Trustee or any     
Affiliate thereof, shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding, except
that, in determining whether Trustee shall be protected in relying upon any such
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver, only      
Certificates which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows to be so 
owned shall be so disregarded. Certificates so owned which have been pledged in 
good faith shall not be disregarded and may be regarded as outstanding if the   
pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of Trustee the pledgee's right so to act
with respect to such Certificates and that the pledgee is not Transferor,       
Servicer, any other Holder of the Transferor Interest or any Affiliate thereof. 

SECTION 6.7. APPOINTMENT OF PAYING AGENT. The Paying Agent shall make
distributions to Investor Holders from the Collection Account or any applicable 
Series Account pursuant to the provisions of the applicable Supplement and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to Trustee. Any Paying Agent shall have
the revocable power to withdraw funds from the Collection Account or any        
applicable Series Account for the purpose of making the distributions referred  
to above. Trustee may revoke such power and remove the Paying Agent if Trustee  
determines in its sole discretion that the Paying Agent shall have failed to    
perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Supplement in any material  
respect. The Paying Agent shall initially be Trustee, and any co-paying agent   
chosen by Transferor and acceptable to Trustee,                                 

59

P-->EX-4.666th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 66th
including, if and so long as any Series or Class is listed on the Luxembourg    
Stock Exchange and such exchange so requires, a co-paying agent in Luxembourg or
another western European city. Any Paying Agent shall be permitted to resign as 
Paying Agent upon 30 days' notice to Trustee. If any Paying Agent shall resign, 
Trustee shall appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent. Trustee shall cause   
each successor or additional Paying Agent to execute and deliver to Trustee an  
instrument in which such successor or additional Paying Agent shall agree with  
Trustee that it will hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the       
Investor Holders in trust for the benefit of the Investor Holders entitled      
thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Investor Holders. The Paying Agent
shall return all unclaimed funds to Trustee and upon removal shall also return  
all funds in its possession to Trustee. The provisions of SECTIONS 11.1, 11.2,  
11.3 and 11.5 shall apply to Trustee also in its role as Paying Agent, for so   
long as Trustee shall act as Paying Agent. Any reference in this Agreement to   
the Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless the context requires  
otherwise.                                                                      

 SECTION 6.8. ACCESS TO LIST OF REGISTERED HOLDERS' NAMES AND ADDRESSES.
Trustee will furnish or cause to be furnished by the Transfer Agent and         
Registrar to Servicer or the Paying Agent, within five Business Days after      
receipt by Trustee of a request therefor, a list in such form as Servicer or the
Paying Agent may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of the          
Registered Holders. If any Holder or group of Holders of Investor Certificates  
of any Series or all outstanding Series, as the case may be, evidencing not less
than 10% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Series or all         
outstanding Series, as applicable (the "APPLICANTS"), apply to Trustee, and such
application states that the Applicants desire to communicate with other Investor
Holders with respect to their rights under this Agreement or any Supplement or  
under the Investor Certificates and is accompanied by a copy of the             
communication which such Applicants propose to transmit, then Trustee, after    
having been indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by such Applicants for   
its costs and expenses shall afford or shall cause the Transfer Agent and       
Registrar to afford such Applicants access during normal business hours to the  
most recent list of Registered Holders of such Series or all outstanding Series,
as applicable, held by Trustee, within five Business Days after the receipt of  
such application. Such list shall be as of a date no more than 45 days prior to 
the date of receipt of such Applicants' request.                                

Every Registered Holder, by receiving and holding a Registered      
Certificate, agrees with Trustee that neither Trustee, the Transfer Agent and   
Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, shall be held accountable by     
reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses  
of the Registered Holders hereunder, regardless of the sources from which such  
information was derived.                                                        

SECTION 6.9. AUTHENTICATING AGENT. (a) Trustee may appoint one or more
authenticating agents with respect to the Certificates which shall be authorized
to act on behalf of Trustee in authenticating the Certificates in connection    
with the issuance, delivery, registration of transfer, exchange or repayment of 
the Certificates. Whenever reference is made in this Agreement to the           
authentication of Certificates by Trustee or Trustee's certificate of           
authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication on     
behalf of Trustee by an authenticating agent and certificate of authentication  
executed on behalf of Trustee by an authenticating agent. Each authenticating   
agent must be acceptable to Transferor and Servicer.

 (b) Any institution succeeding to the corporate agency business of an
authenticating agent shall continue to be an authenticating agent without the   
execution or filing of any power or any further act on the part of Trustee or   
such authenticating agent. An authenticating agent may at any time resign by    
giving notice of resignation to Trustee and to Transferor. Trustee may at any   
time terminate the agency of an authenticating agent by giving notice of        
termination to such authenticating agent and to Transferor. Upon receiving such 
a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time an   
authenticating agent shall cease to be acceptable to Trustee or Transferor,     
Trustee promptly may appoint a successor authenticating agent. Any successor    
authenticating agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become  
vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with
like effect as if originally named as an authenticating agent. No successor     
authenticating agent shall be appointed unless acceptable to Trustee and        
Transferor. Transferor agrees to pay to each authenticating agent from time to  
time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section. The provisions
of SECTIONS 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3 shall be applicable to any authenticating agent.

    (c) Pursuant to an appointment made under this Section, the Certificates
may have endorsed thereon, in lieu of Trustee's certificate of authentication,  
an alternate certificate of authentication in substantially the following form: 

  This is one of the Certificates described in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.                                                                      

                                 _________________________________

                                 _________________________________

                       as Authenticating Agent
                                  for Trustee,

                                        By: ____________________________________

SECTION 6.10. BOOK-ENTRY CERTIFICATES. Unless otherwise specified in
the related Supplement for any Series or Class, the Investor Certificates, upon 
original issuance, shall be issued in the form of one or more typewritten       
Investor Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates, to be delivered 
to the Clearing Agency, by, or on behalf of, Transferor. The Investor           
Certificates shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the   
name of the Clearing Agency or its nominee, and no Certificate Owner will       
receive a definitive certificate representing such Certificate Owner's interest 
in the Investor Certificates, except as provided in SECTION 6.12. Unless and    
until definitive, fully registered Investor Certificates ("DEFINITIVE           
CERTIFICATES") have been issued to the applicable Certificate Owners pursuant to
SECTION 6.12 or as otherwise specified in any such Supplement:                  

 (a) the provisions of this Section shall be in full force and effect;

61

      (b) Transferor, Servicer and Trustee may deal with the Clearing Agency and
the Clearing Agency Participants for all purposes (including the making of      
distributions) as the authorized representatives of the respective Certificate  
Owners;                                                                         

   (c) to the extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any
other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall        
control; and                                                                    

  (d) the rights of the respective Certificate Owners shall be exercised
only through the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants and shall 
be limited to those established by law and agreements between such Certificate  
Owners and the Clearing Agency or the Clearing Agency Participants. Pursuant to 
the Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive Certificates are issued   
pursuant to SECTION 6.12, the Clearing Agency will make book-entry transfers    
among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and transmit distributions of
principal and interest on the related Investor Certificates to such Clearing    
Agency Participants.                                                            

   For purposes of any provision of this Agreement requiring or permitting
actions with the consent of, or at the direction of, Investor Holders evidencing
a specified percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Investor     
Certificates, such direction or consent may be given by Certificate Owners      
(acting through the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants) owning
Investor Certificates evidencing the requisite percentage of principal amount of
Investor Certificates.                                                          

SECTION 6.11. NOTICES TO CLEARING AGENCY. Whenever any notice or other
communication is required to be given to Investor Holders of any Series or Class
with respect to which Book-Entry Certificates have been issued, unless and until
Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to the related Certificate       
Owners, Trustee shall give all such notices and communications to the applicable
Clearing Agency.                                                                

SECTION 6.12. DEFINITIVE CERTIFICATES. If Book-Entry Certificates have
been issued with respect to any Series or Class and (a) Transferor advises      
Trustee that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to discharge      
properly its responsibilities under the Depository Agreement with respect to    
such Series or Class and Trustee or Transferor is unable to engage a qualified  
successor, (b) Transferor, at its option, advises Trustee that it elects to     
terminate the book-entry system with respect to such Series or Class through the
Clearing Agency or (c) after the occurrence of a Servicer Default, Certificate  
Owners of such Series or Class evidencing not less than 50% of the aggregate    
unpaid principal amount of such Series or Class advise Trustee and the Clearing 
Agency through the Clearing Agency Participants that the continuation of a      
book-entry system with respect to the Investor Certificates of such Series or   
Class through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interests of the     
Certificate Owners with respect to such Certificates, then Trustee shall notify 
all Certificate Owners of such Certificates, through the Clearing Agency, of the
occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive Certificates 
to Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to Trustee of any such
Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions   
from the Clearing Agency for registration, Transferor shall execute and Trustee 
shall authenticate and deliver such Definitive Certificates. Neither Transferor 
nor Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and  
may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such      
instructions. Upon the issuance of such Definitive Certificates all references  
herein to obligations                                                           

62

imposed upon or to be performed by the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to be    
imposed upon and performed by Trustee, to the extent applicable with respect to 
such Definitive Certificates and Trustee shall recognize the Holders of such    
Definitive Certificates as Investor Holders hereunder.                          

SECTION 6.13. GLOBAL CERTIFICATE. If specified in the related Supplement
for any Series, or Class, the Investor Certificates for such Series or Class    
will initially be issued in the form of a single temporary global Certificate   
(the "GLOBAL CERTIFICATE") in bearer form, without interest coupons, in the     
denomination of the aggregate principal amount of such Series or Class and      
substantially in the form set forth in the exhibit with respect thereto attached
to the related Supplement. The Global Certificate will be executed by Transferor
and authenticated by Trustee upon the same conditions, in substantially the same
manner and with the same effect as the Definitive Certificates. The Global      
Certificate may be exchanged for Bearer or Registered Certificates in definitive
form (the "DEFINITIVE EURO-CERTIFICATES") pursuant to any applicable Supplement.

SECTION 6.14. UNCERTIFICATED CLASSES. Unless otherwise specified in any
Supplement, the provisions of this ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE XII relating to the   
registration, form, execution, authentication, delivery, presentation,          
cancellation and surrender of Certificates shall not apply to any uncertificated
Certificates.                                                                   

SECTION 6.15. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Transferor in issuing the Certificates
may use "CUSIP" or "private placement" numbers (if then generally in use), and, 
if so, the Trustee shall indicate the "CUSIP" or "private placement" numbers of 
the Certificates in notices of redemption and related materials as a convenience
to Holders; PROVIDED that any such notice may state that no representation is   
made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Certificates
or as contained in any notice of redemption and related materials. The          
Transferor shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

Trust, Trustee, the Holders, any Enhancement Provider or any other Person for   
any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good faith

provision shall not protect Transferor, any Holder of the Transferor Interest or
any such Person against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason
of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or 
by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. Transferor

Providers or any other person for any action taken or for refraining from the

Agreement; PROVIDED that this provision shall not protect Servicer or any such  
Person against any liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of

SECTION 8.5. SERVICER NOT TO RESIGN. Servicer shall not resign from the

that (i) the performance of its duties hereunder is no longer permissible under 
Requirements of Law (other than the charter and by-laws of Servicer) and (ii)

business includes the servicing of credit card accounts as the Successor        
Servicer hereunder. Trustee shall give prompt notice to each Rating Agency and

being afforded without charge but only (a) upon reasonable request, (b) during  
normal business hours, (c) subject to Servicer's normal security and            
confidentiality procedures and (d) at reasonably accessible offices in the      
continental United States designated by

Servicer. Nothing in this Section shall derogate from the obligation of each    
Credit Card Originator, Transferor, Trustee and Servicer to observe any         
applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information regarding the Obligors, and
the failure of Servicer to provide access as provided in this Section as a      
result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this Section.        

SECTION 8.7. DELEGATION OF DUTIES. In the ordinary course of business,
Servicer may at any time delegate any duties hereunder to any Person who agrees 
to conduct such duties in accordance with the Credit Card Guidelines and this   
Agreement. Any such delegations shall not relieve Servicer of its liability and 
responsibility with respect to such duties, and shall not constitute a          
resignation within the meaning of SECTION 8.5, and Servicer shall remain jointly
and severally liable with such Person for any amounts which would otherwise be  
payable pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII as if Servicer had performed such duty;   
PROVIDED that in the case of any significant delegation to a Person other than  
an Affiliate of WFN, at least 30 days' prior written notice shall be given to   
Trustee, each Rating Agency and each Enhancement Provider, if any, entitled     
thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement, of such delegation to any entity   
that is not an Affiliate of Servicer.                                           

ARTICLE IX EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENTS

SECTION 9.1. EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENTS. Each of the following shall 
constitute an "EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT" with respect to each Series:           

(a) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event relating to WFN or the    
Transferor;                                                                     

    (b) the Trust shall become an "investment company" within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act; or                                                  

     (c) WFN shall become unable for any reason to transfer Receivables to the
Transferor pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Agreement or Transferor shall   
become unable for any reason to transfer Receivables to the Trust pursuant to   
this Agreement.                                                                 

SECTION 9.2. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UPON CERTAIN EVENTS. (a) If an Insolvency
Event occurs with respect to Transferor or any Holder of the Transferor Interest
(excluding any Supplemental Interest), Transferor shall on the day any such     
event occurs (the "APPOINTMENT DATE"), immediately cease to transfer Principal  
Receivables, or interests in Principal Receivables represented by any           
Participation Interests to the Trust and shall promptly give notice to Trustee  
thereof. Notwithstanding any cessation of the transfer to the Trust of          
additional Principal Receivables or any Participation Interests, Principal      
Receivables or any Participation Interests transferred to the Trust prior to the
occurrence of such Insolvency Event and Collections in respect of such Principal
Receivables and Participation Interests, and Finance Charge Receivables whenever
created accrued in respect of such Principal Receivables, shall continue to be a
part of the Trust. Upon the Appointment Date, this Agreement and the Trust shall
be deemed to have terminated, subject to the liquidation, winding up and        
dissolution procedures described below. Within 15 days of the Appointment Date, 
Trustee shall (i) publish a notice in an Authorized Newspaper that an Insolvency
Event has occurred, that the Trust has terminated, and that Trustee intends to  
sell, dispose of or otherwise liquidate the Receivables and any Participation   
Interests on commercially reasonable terms and in a commercially reasonable     

68

P-->EX-4.675th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 75th
manner and (ii) give notice to Investor Holders and each Enhancement Provider,  
if any, or other Person entitled thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement    
describing the provisions of this Section. Trustee shall then promptly sell,    
dispose of or otherwise liquidate the Receivables and any Participation         
Interests in a commercially reasonable manner and on commercially reasonable    
terms, which shall include the solicitation of competitive bids. The Trustee    
shall be entitled to hire and consult with financial advisors and agents in     
connection with such sale, disposition or liquidation, at the expense of the    
Servicer and/or the Trust. Trustee may obtain a prior determination from any    
conservator, receiver or liquidator that the terms and manner of any proposed   
sale, disposition or liquidation are commercially reasonable and may            
conclusively rely on such determination. The provisions of SECTIONS 9.1 and 9.2 
shall not be deemed to be mutually exclusive.                                   

(b) The proceeds from the sale, disposition or liquidation of the   
Receivables and any Participation Interests pursuant to PARAGRAPH (a)           
("INSOLVENCY PROCEEDS") shall be immediately deposited in the Collection        
Account. Insolvency Proceeds shall be allocated to Finance Charge Receivables   
and Principal Receivables in the same proportion such Receivables bore to one   
another on the prior Determination Date, although Trustee shall, in consultation
with the Servicer, determine conclusively the amount of the Insolvency Proceeds 
which are deemed to be Finance Charge Receivables and Principal Receivables. The
Insolvency Proceeds shall be allocated and distributed to Investor Holders in   
accordance with ARTICLE IV and each such Supplement.                            

ARTICLE X SERVICER DEFAULTS 

SECTION 10.1. SERVICER DEFAULTS. If any one of the following events (a
"SERVICER DEFAULT") shall occur and be continuing:                              

      (a) any failure by Servicer to make any payment, transfer or deposit or to
give instructions or notice to Trustee pursuant to this Agreement or any        
Supplement on or before the date occurring five Business Days after the date    
such payment, transfer or deposit or such instruction or notice is required to  
be made or given, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any Supplement;   

 (b) failure on the part of Servicer to duly observe or perform in any
material respect any other covenants or agreements of Servicer set forth in this
Agreement or any Supplement which has a material adverse effect on the interests
hereunder of the Investor Holders of any Series or Class (which determination   
shall be made without regard to whether funds are then available pursuant to any
Enhancement) and which continues unremedied for a period of 60 days after the   
date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied,
shall have been given to Servicer by Trustee, or to Servicer and Trustee by     
Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate  
unpaid principal amount of all Investor Certificates (or, with respect to any   
such failure that does not relate to all Series, 25% of the aggregate unpaid    
principal amount of all Series to which such failure relates); or Servicer shall
delegate its duties under this Agreement, except as permitted by SECTIONS 8.2   
and 8.7, a Responsible Officer of Trustee has actual knowledge of such          
delegation and such delegation continues unremedied for 15 days after the date  
on which written notice thereof, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have  
been given to Servicer by Trustee, or to Servicer and Trustee by                

69

P-->EX-4.676th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 76th
Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate  
unpaid principal amount of all Investor Certificates;                           

      (c) any representation, warranty or certification made by Servicer in this
Agreement or any Supplement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this    
Agreement or any Supplement shall prove to have been incorrect when made, which 
has a material adverse effect on the rights of the Investor Holders of any      
Series or Class (which determination shall be made without regard to whether    
funds are then available pursuant to any Enhancement) and which continues to be 
incorrect in any material respect for a period of 60 days after the date on     
which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall  
have been given to Servicer by Trustee, or to Servicer and Trustee by the       
Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate  
unpaid principal amount of all Investor Certificates (or, with respect to any   
such representation, warranty or certification that does not relate to all      
Series, 25% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Series to which such
representation, warranty or certification relates); or                          

   (d) Servicer shall fail generally to, or admit in writing its inability
to, pay its debts as they become due; or a proceeding shall have been instituted
in a court having jurisdiction in the premises seeking a decree or order for    
relief in respect of Servicer in an involuntary case under any Debtor Relief    
Law, or for the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee,       
custodian, sequestrator, conservator or other similar official of such Person or
for any substantial part of its property, or for the winding-up or liquidation  
of its affairs and, if instituted against Servicer, any such proceeding shall   
continue undismissed or unstayed and in effect, for a period of 60 consecutive  
days, or any of the actions sought in such proceeding shall occur; or the       
commencement by Servicer, of a voluntary case under any Debtor Relief Law, or   
such Person's consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case
under any Debtor Relief Law, or consent to the appointment of or taking         
possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian,             
sequestrator, conservator or other similar official of such Person or for any   
substantial part of its property, or any general assignment for the benefit of  
creditors; or such Person or any Subsidiary of such Person shall have taken any 
corporate action in furtherance of any of the foregoing actions;                

then, in the event of any Servicer Default, so long as the Servicer Default     
shall not have been remedied, either Trustee or the Holders of Investor         
Certificates evidencing more than 50% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount  
of all Investor Certificates, by notice given to Servicer (and to Trustee and   
any Enhancement Provider entitled thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement if
given by the Investor Holders) (a "TERMINATION NOTICE"), may terminate all but  
not less than all the rights and obligations of Servicer, as Servicer, under    
this Agreement and in and to the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.          

      After receipt by Servicer of such Termination Notice, and on the date that
a Successor Servicer shall have been appointed by Trustee pursuant to SECTION   
10.2, all authority and power of Servicer under this Agreement shall pass to and
be vested in the Successor Servicer (a "SERVICE TRANSFER"); and, without        
limitation, Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered (upon the failure of     
Servicer to cooperate) to execute and deliver, on behalf of Servicer, as        
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, all documents and other instruments upon the     
failure of Servicer to execute or deliver such documents or instruments, and to 
do and accomplish all other acts or things                                      

70

P-->EX-4.677th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 77th
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of servicing   
rights. Servicer agrees to cooperate with Trustee and the Successor Servicer in 
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of Servicer to     
conduct servicing hereunder including the transfer to the Successor Servicer of 
all authority of Servicer to service the Receivables provided for under this    
Agreement, including all authority over all Collections which shall on the date 
of transfer be held by Servicer for deposit, or which have been deposited by    
Servicer, in the Collection Account, or which shall thereafter be received with 
respect to the Receivables, and in assisting the Successor Servicer and in      
enforcing all rights to Insurance Proceeds. Servicer shall promptly transfer its
electronic records relating to the Receivables to the Successor Servicer in such
electronic form as the Successor Servicer may reasonably request and shall      
promptly transfer to the Successor Servicer all other records, correspondence   
and documents necessary for the continued servicing of the Receivables in the   
manner and at such times as the Successor Servicer shall reasonably request. To 
the extent that compliance with this SECTION 10.1 shall require Servicer to     
disclose to the Successor Servicer information of any kind which Servicer       
reasonably deems to be confidential, the Successor Servicer shall be required to
enter into such customary licensing and confidentiality agreements as Servicer  
shall deem appropriate to protect its interests.                                

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, any delay in or failure of performance
under SECTION 10.1(a) for a period of five Business Days or under SECTION       
10.1(b) or (c) for a period of 60 days (in addition to any period provided in   
SECTION 10.1(a), (b) or (c)) shall not constitute a Servicer Default until the  
expiration of such additional five Business Days or 60 days, respectively, if   
such delay or failure could not be prevented by the exercise of reasonable      
diligence by Servicer and such delay or failure was caused by an act of God or  
the public enemy, acts of declared or undeclared war, public disorder, rebellion
or sabotage, epidemics, landslides, lightning, fire, hurricanes, earthquakes,   
floods or similar causes. The preceding sentence shall not relieve Servicer from
the obligation to use its best efforts to perform its obligations in a timely   
manner in accordance with this Agreement and any Supplement and Servicer shall  
provide Trustee, each Rating Agency, any Enhancement Provider entitled thereto  
pursuant to the relevant Supplement, Transferor and the Investor Holders with an
Officer's Certificate giving immediate notice of such failure or delay by it,   
together with a description of its efforts to so perform its obligations.       

SECTION 10.2. TRUSTEE TO ACT; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) On and after
the receipt by Servicer of a Termination Notice pursuant to SECTION 10.1,       
Servicer shall continue to perform all servicing functions under this Agreement 
until the date specified in the Termination Notice or otherwise specified by    
Trustee or until a date mutually agreed upon by Servicer and Trustee. Trustee   
shall, as promptly as possible after the giving of a Termination Notice, appoint
an Eligible Servicer as a successor servicer (the "SUCCESSOR SERVICER"), and    
such Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in 
a form acceptable to Trustee. If a Successor Servicer has not been appointed or 
has not accepted its appointment at the time when Servicer ceases to act as     
Servicer, Trustee without further action shall automatically be appointed the   
Successor Servicer. Trustee may delegate any of its servicing obligations to an 
Affiliate of Trustee or agent in accordance with SECTION 3.1(b) and 8.7.        
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Trustee shall, if it is legally unable so to act,
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint any established           
institution having a net worth of not less than $50,000,000 and whose regular   
business includes the servicing of credit card receivables as the Successor     
Servicer hereunder. Trustee shall give prompt notice to each Rating Agency and  
each Enhancement Provider, if any,                                              

71

entitled thereto pursuant to the applicable Supplement upon the appointment of a
Successor Servicer.                                                             

      (b) Upon its appointment, the Successor Servicer shall be the successor in
all respects to Servicer with respect to servicing functions under this         
Agreement and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and          
liabilities (except for liabilities arising during the period of time when the  
prior Servicer was performing and acting as Servicer) relating thereto placed on
Servicer by the terms and provisions hereof, and all references in this         
Agreement to Servicer shall be deemed to refer to the Successor Servicer.       

  (c) In connection with any Termination Notice, Trustee will review any
bids which it obtains from Eligible Servicers and shall be permitted to appoint 
any Eligible Servicer submitting such a bid as a Successor Servicer for         
servicing compensation not in excess of the aggregate Servicing Fees for all    
Series; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Holder of the Transferor Interest shall be  
responsible for payment of the portion of such aggregate Servicing Fees         
allocable to the Holder of the Transferor Interest and that no such monthly     
compensation paid out of Collections shall be in excess of such aggregate       
Servicing Fees. Each Holder of the Transferor Interest agrees that, if WFN (or  
any Successor Servicer) is terminated as Servicer hereunder, the portion of the 
Collections in respect of Finance Charge Receivables that Transferor is entitled
to receive pursuant to this Agreement or any Supplement shall be reduced by an  
amount sufficient to pay Transferor's share (determined by reference to the     
Supplements with respect to any outstanding Series) of the compensation of the  
Successor Servicer.                                                             

    (d) All authority and power granted to the Successor Servicer under this
Agreement shall automatically cease and terminate upon termination of the Trust 
pursuant to SECTION 12.1 and shall pass to and be vested in Transferor and,     
without limitation, Transferor is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and
deliver, on behalf of the Successor Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, 
all documents and other instruments, and to do and accomplish all other acts or 
things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such transfer of      
servicing rights. The Successor Servicer agrees to cooperate with Transferor in 
effecting the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the Successor   
Servicer to conduct servicing on the Receivables. The Successor Servicer shall  
transfer its electronic records relating to the Receivables to Transferor in    
such electronic form as Transferor may reasonably request and shall transfer all
other records, correspondence and documents to Transferor in the manner and at  
such times as Transferor shall reasonably request. To the extent that compliance
with this SECTION 10.2 shall require the Successor Servicer to disclose to      
Transferor information of any kind which the Successor Servicer deems to be     
confidential, Transferor shall be required to enter into such customary         
licensing and confidentiality agreements as the Successor Servicer shall deem   
appropriate to protect its interests.                                           

SECTION 10.3. NOTIFICATION TO HOLDERS. Within two Business Days after
Servicer becomes aware of any Servicer Default, Servicer shall give notice      
thereof to Trustee, each Rating Agency and any Enhancement Provider entitled    
thereto pursuant to the relevant Supplement and Trustee shall give notice to the
Investor Holders. Upon any termination or appointment of a Successor Servicer   
pursuant to this Article, Trustee shall give prompt notice thereof to the       
Investor Holders.                                                               

72

P-->EX-4.679th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 79th
SECTION 10.4. WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS. The Holders of Investor      
Certificates evidencing undivided interests in the Trust aggregating more than  
66-2/3% of the Invested Amount of each Series then outstanding affected by any  
default by Servicer may, on behalf of all Holders of Certificates of such       
affected Series, waive any default by Servicer in the performance of its        
obligations hereunder and its consequences, except a default in the failure to  
make any required deposits or payments of interest or principal with respect to 
any Series of Certificates. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such default
shall cease to exist, and any default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have 
been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend  
to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except
to the extent expressly so waived.                                              

ARTICLE XI TRUSTEE

SECTION 11.1. DUTIES OF TRUSTEE. (a) Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a
Servicer Default and after the curing of all Servicer Defaults which may have   
occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are         
specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations
shall be read into this Agreement against the Trustee. If a Servicer Default has
occurred (which has not been cured or waived) Trustee shall exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and use the same degree of    
care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under 
the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.                  

   (b) Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished to Trustee  
which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any provision of    
this Agreement (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of any         
mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein), shall examine them to 
determine whether they substantially conform to the requirements of this        
Agreement. Trustee shall give prompt written notice to the Holders of any       
material lack of conformity of any such instrument to the applicable            
requirements of this Agreement discovered by Trustee which would entitle a      
specified percentage of the Holders to take any action pursuant to this         
Agreement.                                                                      

   (c) Subject to SECTION 11.1(a), no provision of this Agreement shall be
construed to relieve Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its   
own negligent failure to act or its own misconduct; PROVIDED that:              

           (i) Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error of judgment
  made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of
Trustee, unless it shall be proved that Trustee was negligent in    
ascertaining the pertinent facts;                                   

       (ii) Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any
action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
 accordance with the direction of the Holders of Investor Certificates
   relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to Trustee, or exercising any trust or power   
conferred upon Trustee, under this Agreement; PROVIDED that, such   
    direction is delivered by the Holder of Investor Certificates evidencing
the percentage of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Investor 
     Certificates of all Series to which such action relates required for such
action by this Agreement; and                                       

73

P-->EX-4.680th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 80th
            (iii) Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of (x) any failure
 by Servicer referred to in SECTION 10.1 or (y) any Early Amortization
     Event unless a Responsible Officer of Trustee obtains actual knowledge of
such failure or Early Amortization Event or Trustee receives written
 notice of such failure or Early Amortization Event from Servicer, any
Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the
    aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Investor Certificates (or, with
      respect to any such failure that does not relate to all Series, 25% of the
 aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Investor Certificates of all
  Series to which such failure relates, or the Enhancement Providers, if
any, for all Series to which such failure relates).                 

(d) Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties     
hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder or        
thereunder, if there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of   
such funds or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against such risk or      
liability is not reasonably assured to it, and none of the provisions contained 
in this Agreement shall in any event require Trustee to perform, or be          
responsible for the manner of performance of, any of the obligations of Servicer
under this Agreement except during such time, if any, as Trustee shall be the   
successor to, and be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of,  
Servicer in accordance with this Agreement.                                     

      (e) Trustee shall have no power to vary the corpus of the Trust, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.                                           

     (f) If the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent and Registrar shall fail to
perform any obligation, duty or agreement in the manner or on the day required  
to be performed by the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent and Registrar, as the 
case may be, under this Agreement, Trustee shall be obligated promptly upon     
knowledge of a Responsible Officer thereof and receipt of appropriate records,  
if any, to perform such obligation, duty or agreement in the manner so required.

(g) If Credit Card Originator has agreed to transfer any of its     
receivables (other than the Receivables) to another Person other than the       
Transferor, upon the written request of Credit Card Originator, Trustee will    
enter into such intercreditor agreements with the transferee of such receivables
as are customary and necessary to separately identify the rights of the Trust   
and such other Person in Credit Card Originator's receivables; PROVIDED that    
Trustee shall not be required to enter into any intercreditor agreement which   
could adversely affect the interests of the Holders and, upon the request of    
Trustee, Credit Card Originator will deliver an Opinion of Counsel relating to  
such intercreditor agreement.                                                   

SECTION 11.2. CERTAIN MATTERS AFFECTING TRUSTEE. Except as otherwise
provided in Section 11.1:                                                       

(a) Trustee may conclusively rely on and shall be fully protected in
acting on, or in refraining from acting in accord with, any resolution,         
Officer's Certificate, certificate of auditors or any other certificate,        
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,

or direction of any of the Holders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any Enhancement Agreement, unless such Holders shall have offered to Trustee 
security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses

herein shall, however, relieve Trustee of the obligations, upon the occurrence  
of any Servicer Default (which has not been cured) to exercise such of the      
rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and to use the same degree of 
care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under

Investor Certificates of all Series to which such matters relate);              

    (f) Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform
any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys,

required to make any initial or periodic examination of any documents or records
related to the Receivables or the Accounts for the purpose of establishing the

representations and warranties or for any other purpose;

performance or observance of any covenants, conditions or agreements on the part
of the Transferor or the Servicer;                                              

    (l) The permissive rights of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this

SECTION 11.3. TRUSTEE NOT LIABLE FOR RECITALS IN CERTIFICATES. Trustee
assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the recitals contained herein  
and in the Certificates (other than the certificate of authentication on the

representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or any      
Supplement or of the Certificates (other than the certificate of authentication

application of any funds paid to Transferor or the Holder of the Transferor     
Interest in respect of the Receivables or deposited in or withdrawn from the    
Collection Account, any Series Accounts or any other accounts hereafter         
established to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in
accordance with this Agreement.                                                 

SECTION 11.4. TRUSTEE NOT TO OWN CERTIFICATES. Trustee shall not in its
individual capacity, but may in a fiduciary capacity, become the owner or       
pledgee of Investor Certificates. If Trustee becomes the owner or pledgee of

it would have if it were not Trustee.                                           

SECTION 11.5. SERVICER TO PAY TRUSTEE'S FEES AND EXPENSES. Servicer

provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust)
for all services rendered by it in the execution of the trust hereby created and
in the exercise and performance of any of the powers and duties hereunder of    
Trustee, and Servicer will pay or reimburse Trustee (without reimbursement from 
the Collection Account or otherwise) upon its request for all reasonable        
expenses or disbursements incurred or made by Trustee in accordance with any of 
the provisions of this Agreement or any Enhancement Agreement (including the    
reasonable fees and expenses of its agents, any co-trustee and counsel) except  
any such expense, disbursement or advance shall be determined to have been      
caused by its own negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith and except as     
provided

in the following sentence. If Trustee is appointed Successor Servicer pursuant  
to SECTION 10.2, the provisions of this SECTION 11.5 shall not apply to         
expenses, disbursements and advances made or incurred by Trustee in its capacity
as Successor Servicer. When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services in  
connection with an Insolvency Event or a Servicer Default under Section 10.1(d),
such expenses (including the fees and expenses of its counsel and agents) and   
the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of       
administration under any bankruptcy law or law relating to creditors rights     
generally.                                                                      

     The obligations of Servicer under SECTION 8.4 and this SECTION 11.5 shall
survive the termination of the Trust and the resignation or removal of Trustee. 

SECTION 11.6. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR TRUSTEE. Trustee shall at all
times be a bank, trust company or a corporation organized and doing business    
under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof authorized  
under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital   
and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by
Federal or state authority and maintain any credit or deposit rating required by
any Rating Agency (as of the date hereof Baa3 for Moody's) that is not an       
Affiliate of the Transferor. If such bank or corporation publishes reports of   
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the      
aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this      
SECTION 11.6, the combined capital and surplus of such bank or corporation shall
be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. In case at any time Trustee shall cease to be 
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this SECTION 11.6, Trustee shall  
resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in SECTION 11.7. 

SECTION 11.7. RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE. (a) Trustee may at any
time resign and be discharged from the trust hereby created by giving written   
notice thereof to Servicer. Upon receiving such notice of resignation,          
Transferor shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in 
duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning     
Trustee and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall    
have been so appointed and have accepted within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition at the expense of the 
transferor any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a         
successor trustee.                                                              

    (b) If at any time Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of SECTION 11.6 and shall fail to resign after written request   
therefor by Servicer or Transferor, or if at any time Trustee shall be legally  
unable to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of   
Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take 
charge or control of Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of   
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, in which event Servicer shall      
remove Trustee and promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument,  
in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to Trustee so     
removed and one copy to the successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall    
have been so appointed and have accepted within 30 days of the giving of such   
notice of removal, the removed trustee may petition any court of competent      
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

in SECTION 11.8 and any liability of Trustee arising hereunder shall survive    
such appointment of a successor trustee.                                        

SECTION 11.8. SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE. (a) Any successor trustee appointed as
provided in SECTION 11.7 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Transferor,  
to Servicer and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such         
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the          
predecessor Trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without  
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the     
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with the   
like effect as if originally named as Trustee herein. Upon payment in full of   
all fees and expenses due and owing to it hereunder, the predecessor Trustee    
shall deliver to the successor trustee all documents and statements held by it  
hereunder, and Transferor and the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver 
such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for     
fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor trustee all such    
rights, powers, duties and obligations.                                         

 (b) No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
SECTION 11.8 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall 
be eligible under SECTION 11.6.                                                 

    (c) Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided in
this Section, such successor trustee shall provide notice of such succession    
hereunder to all Investor Holders and Servicer shall provide such notice to each
Rating Agency and any Enhancement Provider entitled thereto pursuant to the     
relevant Supplement.                                                            

SECTION 11.9. MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION OF TRUSTEE. Any Person into which
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any 
Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which Trustee  
shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate trust business of   
Trustee, shall be the successor of Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation 
shall be eligible under the provisions of SECTION 11.6, without the execution or
filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.                                

SECTION 11.10. APPOINTMENT OF CO-TRUSTEE OR SEPARATE TRUSTEE. (a)   
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the    
purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part 
of the Trust may at the time be located, Trustee shall have the power and may   
execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons to act as a  
co-trustee or co-trustees, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or  
any part of the Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity  
and for the benefit of the Holders, such title to the Trust, or any part        
thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this SECTION 11.10, such       
powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as Trustee may consider necessary
or desirable; PROVIDED, that Trustee shall exercise due care in the appointment 
of any co-trustee. No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required
to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under SECTION 11.6 and  
no notice to Holders of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee   
shall be required under SECTION 11.8.

    (b) Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:

           (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
      upon Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed
by Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being
    understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to
    act separately without Trustee joining in such act) except to the extent
  that under any laws of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or
     acts are to be performed (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to
      Servicer hereunder) Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and    
   obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion
     thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly
  by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of
Trustee;

any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

     (c) Any notice, request or other writing given to Trustee shall be deemed
to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as    
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any        
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions 
of this ARTICLE XI. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of
the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in 
its instrument of appointment, either jointly with Trustee or separately, as may
be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,           
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, Trustee. Every such 
instrument shall be filed with Trustee and a copy thereof given to Servicer.    

     (d) Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time constitute Trustee
its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not  
prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect to this Agreement on
its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall die,    
become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates,           
properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by       
Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or    
successor trustee.

Servicer shall prepare or shall cause to be prepared any tax returns required to
be filed by the Trust and shall remit such returns to Trustee for signature at  
least five days before such returns are due to be filed; Trustee shall promptly 
sign such returns and deliver such returns after signature to Servicer and such 
returns shall be filed by Servicer. Servicer in accordance with each Supplement 
shall also prepare or shall cause to be prepared all tax information required by
law to be distributed to Investor Holders. Trustee upon written request, will   
furnish Servicer with all such information known to Trustee as may be reasonably
required in connection with the preparation of all tax returns of the Trust. In 
no event shall Trustee or Servicer (except as provided in SECTIONS 7.4 or 8.4)  
be liable for any liabilities, costs or expenses of the Trust or the Investor   
Holders arising

CERTIFICATES. All rights of action and claims under this Agreement or the       
Certificates may be prosecuted and enforced by Trustee without the possession of
any of the Certificates or the production thereof in any proceeding relating    
thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by Trustee shall be brought in its  
own name as trustee. Any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the    
payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of 
Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders in   
respect of which such judgment has been obtained.                               

SECTION 11.13. SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT. If a Servicer Default shall occur
and be continuing of which a Responsible Officer of Trustee has received written
notice, Trustee, in its discretion may, subject to the provisions of SECTIONS   
10.1 and 11.14, proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the 
Holders under this Agreement by a suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law
or otherwise, whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement 
contained in this Agreement or in aid of the execution of any power granted in  
this Agreement or for the enforcement of any other legal, equitable or other    
remedy as Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall deem most effectual to

such direction if Trustee being advised by counsel determines that the action so
directed may not lawfully be taken, or if Trustee in good faith shall, by a     
Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of Trustee, determine that the      
proceedings so directed would be illegal or involve it in personal liability and
PROVIDED FURTHER that nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right of       
Trustee to take any action deemed necessary by Trustee and which is not         
inconsistent with such direction.

Trustee advises such recipient of the confidential nature of the information    
being disclosed, or (iii) any other disclosure authorized by the Servicer or the
Transferor.                                                                     

ARTICLE XII TERMINATION 

SECTION 12.1. TERMINATION OF TRUST. The Trust and the respective    
obligations and responsibilities of Transferor, Servicer and Trustee created    
hereby (other than the obligation of Trustee to make payments to Investor       
Holders as hereinafter set forth) shall terminate, except with respect to the   
duties described in SECTIONS 7.4, 8.4 and 12.2(b), upon the earlier of (i)      
January 1, 2021, (ii) the day following the Distribution Date on which the      
Invested Amount for each Series is zero (PROVIDED that Transferor has delivered 
a written notice to Trustee electing to terminate the Trust) and (iii) the date 
provided in SECTION 9.2.                                                        

SECTION 12.2. FINAL DISTRIBUTION. (a) Servicer shall give Trustee at least
30 days prior notice of the Distribution Date on which the Investor Holders of  
any Series or Class may surrender their Investor Certificates for payment of the
final distribution on and cancellation of such Investor Certificates (or, in the
event of a final distribution resulting from the application of SECTION 2.6, 9.2
or 10.1, notice of such Distribution Date promptly after Servicer has determined
that a final distribution will occur, if such determination is made less than 30
days prior to such Distribution Date). Such notice shall be accompanied by an   
Officer's Certificate setting forth the information specified in SECTION 3.5    
covering the period during the then current Servicer fiscal year through the    
date of such notice. Not later than the fifth day of the month in which the     
final distribution in respect of such Series or Class is payable to Investor    
Holders, Trustee shall provide notice to Investor Holders of such Series or     
Class specifying (i) the date upon which final payment of such Series or Class  
will be made upon presentation and surrender of Investor Certificates of such   
Series or Class at the office or offices therein designated, (ii) the amount of 
any such final payment and (iii) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to   
such payment date is not applicable, payments being made only upon presentation 
and surrender of such Investor Certificates at the office or offices therein    
specified (which, in the case of Bearer Certificates, shall be outside the      
United States). Trustee shall give such notice to the Transfer Agent and        
Registrar and the Paying Agent at the time such notice is given to Investor     
Holders.                                                                        

   (b) Notwithstanding a final distribution to the Investor Holders of any
Series or Class (or the termination of the Trust), except as otherwise provided 
in this paragraph, all funds then on deposit in the Collection Account, the     
Excess Funding Account and any Series Account allocated to such Investor Holders
shall continue to be held in trust for the benefit of such Investor Holders and 
the Paying Agent or Trustee shall pay such funds to such Investor Holders upon  
surrender of their Investor Certificates (and any excess shall be paid in       
accordance with any relevant Enhancement Agreement). If all such Investor       
Holders shall not surrender their Investor Certificates for cancellation within 
six months after the date specified in the notice from Trustee described in     
PARAGRAPH (a), Trustee shall give a second notice to the remaining such Investor
Holders to surrender their Investor Certificates for cancellation and receive   
the final distribution with respect thereto (which surrender and payment, in the
case of Bearer Certificates, shall be outside the United States). If within one 
year after the second notice all such Investor Certificates shall not have been 
surrendered for cancellation, Trustee may take appropriate steps, or may appoint
an agent to take appropriate steps, to contact the remaining such Investor      
Holders concerning surrender of their Investor Certificates, and the cost       
thereof shall be paid out of the                                                

82

P-->EX-4.689th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 89th
funds in the Collection Account or any Series Account held for the benefit of   
such Investor Holders. Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to Transferor any 
moneys held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains       
unclaimed for two years. After payment to Transferor, Investor Holders entitled 
to the money must look to Transferor for payment as general creditors unless an 
applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.                    

      (c) If the Invested Amount with respect to any Series is greater than zero
on its Series Termination Date or such earlier date as is specified in the      
related Supplement (after giving effect to deposits and distributions otherwise 
to be made on such date), Trustee will sell or cause to be sold on such Series  
Termination Date, in accordance with the procedures and subject to the          
conditions described in such Supplement, Principal Receivables and the related  
Finance Charge Receivables (or, if a Tax Opinion is obtained, interests therein)
in an amount up to 110% of the Invested Amount with respect to such Series on   
such date (after giving effect to such deposits and distributions; PROVIDED that
in no event shall such amount exceed an amount of Principal Receivables (and all
associated Finance Charge Receivables) equal to the sum of (i) the product of   
(A) Transferor Percentage, (B) the aggregate outstanding Principal Receivables, 
and (C) a fraction the numerator of which is the related Investor Percentage of 
Collections of Finance Charge Receivables and the denominator of which is the   
sum of all Investor Percentages with respect to Collections of Finance Charge   
Receivables of all Series outstanding and (ii) the Invested Amount of such      
Series). The proceeds from any such sale shall be allocated and distributed in  
accordance with the applicable Supplement.                                      

SECTION 12.3. TRANSFEROR'S TERMINATION RIGHTS. Upon the termination of the
Trust pursuant to SECTION 12.1, Trustee shall assign and convey to the holder of
the Transferor Interest or its designee, without recourse, representation or    
warranty, all right, title and interest of the Trust in the Receivables, whether
then existing or thereafter created, all moneys due or to become due and all    
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof, except for      
amounts held by Trustee pursuant to SECTION 12.2(b). Trustee shall execute and  
deliver such instruments of transfer and assignment, in each case without       
recourse, as shall be reasonably requested by Transferor to vest in Transferor  
or its designee all right, title and interest which the Trust had in the        
Receivables and such other related assets.

remedies provided in this Agreement as herein set forth; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction or condition such       
amendment may provide for a particular period of grace after default or may     
provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default or may limit the remedies
available to Trustee upon such default, (ii) curing any ambiguity or correcting 
or supplementing any provision contained herein or in any Supplement which may  
be defective or inconsistent with any other provision contained herein or in any
Supplement or to surrender any

Interest, (iv) the addition of a Participation Interest or receivables arising  
in VISA, MasterCard or any other type of open end revolving credit card account 
to the Trust, (v) the assumption by another entity, in accordance with the      
provisions of this Agreement, of Transferor's obligations hereunder, or (vi) the
provision of additional Enhancement for the benefit of Holders of any Series) by
Servicer, Transferor and Trustee without the consent of such Holders as provided
for in the applicable Supplement, PROVIDED that (x) Transferor shall have       
delivered to Trustee an Officer's Certificate to the effect that Transferor     
reasonably believes that such action shall not adversely affect in any material 
respect the interests of any Investor Holder, (y) the Rating Agency Condition   
shall have been satisfied with respect to any such amendment and (z) a Tax      
Opinion is delivered in connection with any such amendment. The designation of  
additional or substitute Transferors or additional Credit Card Originators      
pursuant to SECTION 2.11 or 2.12 shall be subject to this SECTION 13.1 only to  
the extent that the supplement to this Agreement providing for such designation 
amends any of the terms of this Agreement.                                      

      (b) This Agreement or any Supplement may also be amended from time to time
by Servicer, Transferor and Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of Investor
Certificates (acting for themselves or through any designated agents, as        
provided for in any applicable Supplement) evidencing not less than 66-2/3% of  
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Investor Certificates of all       
adversely affected Series and, unless the Rating Agency Condition is satisfied, 
of each Class of each such Series, for the purpose of adding any provisions to  
or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement
or any Supplement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders;      
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such amendment shall (i) reduce in any manner the    
amount of or delay the timing of any distributions to be made to any Investor   
Holders or deposits of amounts to be so distributed or the amount available     
under any Enhancement without the consent of each affected Holder (provided that
any amendment of the terms of an Early Amortization Event shall not be deemed to
be within the scope of this CLAUSE (i)), (ii) change the definition of or the   
manner of calculating the interest of any Investor Holder without the consent of
each affected Investor Holder (acting for themselves or through any designated  
agents, as provided for in any applicable Supplement) or (iii) reduce the       
aforesaid percentage required to consent to any such amendment without the      
consent of each Investor Holder (acting for themselves or through any designated
agents, as provided for in any applicable Supplement) and, unless the Rating    
Agency Condition is satisfied, of each Class of each such Series. Any amendment 
to be effected pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to adversely affect   
all outstanding Series, other than any Series with respect to which such action 
shall not, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel for Transferor, addressed and  
delivered to Trustee, adversely affect in any material respect the interests of 
any Investor Holder of such Series. Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, 
enter into any such amendment which affects Trustee's rights, duties or         
immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.                                   

    (c) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment or consent (other
than an amendment pursuant to PARAGRAPH (a)), Trustee shall furnish notification
of the substance of such amendment to each Investor Holder; and Servicer shall  
furnish prior notification of the substance of such amendment to (i) each Rating
Agency and (ii) each Enhancement Provider, if any, entitled thereto pursuant to 
the relevant Supplement.

   (d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Investor Holders under
this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it   
shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The    
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the    
execution thereof by Investor Holders shall be subject to such reasonable       
requirements as Trustee may prescribe.                                          

    (e) Any Supplement executed in accordance with the provisions of SECTION
6.3 shall not be considered an amendment to this Agreement for the purposes of  
this Section.                                                                   

    (f) The Holders of Investor Certificates evidencing more than 66-2/3% of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Investor Certificates of each      
Series, or, with respect to any Series with two or more Classes, of each Class  
(or, with respect to any default that does not relate to all Series, 66-2/3% of 
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Investor Certificates of each      
Series to which such default relates or, with respect to any such Series with   
two or more Classes, of each Class) may, on behalf of all Holders, waive any    
default by Transferor or Servicer in the performance of their obligations       
hereunder and its consequences, except the failure to make any distributions    
required to be made to Investor Holders or to make any required deposits of any 
amounts to be so distributed. Upon any such waiver of a past default, such      
default shall cease to exist, and any default arising therefrom shall be deemed 
to have been remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall 
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon
except to the extent expressly so waived.                                       

SECTION 13.2. PROTECTION OF RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST TO TRUST. (a) 
Transferor shall cause this Agreement, all amendments and supplements hereto and
all financing statements and continuation statements and any other necessary    
documents covering the Holders, and Trustee's right, title and interest to the  
Trust to be promptly recorded, registered and filed, and at all times to be kept
recorded, registered and filed, all in such manner and in such places as may be 
required by law fully to preserve and protect the right, title and interest of  
the Holders and Trustee hereunder to all property comprising the Trust Assets.  
Transferor shall deliver to Trustee file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts  
for, any document recorded, registered or filed as provided above, as soon as   
available following such recording, registration or filing.                     

      (b) Within 30 days after Transferor makes any change in its name, identity
or corporate structure which would make any financing statement or continuation 
statement filed in accordance with PARAGRAPH (a) seriously misleading within the
meaning of Section 9-402(7) (or any comparable provision) of the UCC, Transferor
shall give Trustee notice of any such change and shall file such financing      
statements or amendments as may be necessary to continue the perfection of the  
Trust's security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.          

(c) Transferor and Servicer will give Trustee prompt notice of any  
relocation of any office from which it services Receivables or keeps records    
concerning the Receivables or of its principal executive office and whether, as 
a result of such relocation, the applicable provisions of the UCC would require 
the filing of any amendment of any previously filed financing or continuation   
statement or of any new financing statement and shall file such financing       
statements or amendments as may be necessary to perfect or to continue the      
perfection of the Trust's security interest in the Receivables and the proceeds 
thereof. Transferor and Servicer will at all

covering the same substantive legal issues addressed by EXHIBIT E-2 but         
conformed to the extent appropriate to relate to Participation Interests; and

Opinion of Counsel to the effect specified in EXHIBIT E-2.                      

SECTION 13.3. LIMITATION ON RIGHTS OF HOLDERS. (a) The death or incapacity
of any Holder shall not operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust, nor   
shall such death or incapacity entitle such Holders' legal representatives or   
heirs to claim an accounting or to take any action or commence any proceeding in
any court for a partition or winding up of the Trust, nor otherwise affect the  
rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties hereto or any of them.       

    (b) No Investor Holder shall have any right to vote (except as expressly
provided in this Agreement) or in any manner otherwise control the operation and
management of the Trust, or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall

construed so as to constitute the Investor Holders from time to time as partners
or members of an association, nor shall any Investor Holder be under any        
liability to any third person by reason of any action by the parties to this    
Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.                                     

      (c) No Investor Holder shall have any right by virtue of any provisions of
this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law  
upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless such Investor Holder    
previously shall have made, and unless the Holders of Investor Certificates     
evidencing more than 50% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all        
Investor Certificates (or, with respect to any such action, suit or proceeding  
that does not relate to all Series, 50% of the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Investor Certificates of all Series which such action, suit or proceeding
relates) shall have made written request to Trustee to institute such action,   
suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered  
to Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs,       
expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and Trustee, for 60 
days after its receipt of such request and offer of indemnity, shall have       
neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding; it being 
understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by each Investor Holder 
with every other Investor Holder and Trustee, that no one or more Investor      
Holders shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing    
itself or themselves of any provisions of this Agreement to affect, disturb or  
prejudice the rights of Holders of any other of the Investor Certificates, or to
obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other Investor      
Holder, or to enforce any right under this Agreement, except in the manner      
herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Investor   
Holders except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. For the

WITNESSETH

      WHEREAS Transferor, Servicer and Trustee are parties to the Second Amended
and Restated Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of August 1, 2001 (as may 
be amended and supplemented from time to time, the "AGREEMENT");                

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement, Transferor wishes to designate  
Supplemental Accounts owned by the Credit Card Originator to be included as     
Accounts and to convey the Receivables of such Supplemental Accounts, whether   
now existing or hereafter created, to the Trust as part of the corpus of the    
Trust (as each such term is defined in the Agreement); and                      

WHEREAS Trustee is willing to accept such designation and conveyance
subject to the terms and conditions hereof;                                     

     NOW, THEREFORE, Transferor, Servicer and Trustee hereby agree as follows:

1. DEFINED TERMS. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings     
ascribed to them in the Agreement unless otherwise defined herein.              

"Addition Date" means, with respect to the Supplemental Accounts    
designated hereby, ________, ____.                                              

    "Addition Cut Off Date" means, with respect to the Supplemental Accounts

(1)   To be dated as of the applicable Addition Date.                           

Exhibit A, Page 1 

P-->EX-4.698th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 98th
2. DESIGNATION OF SUPPLEMENTAL ACCOUNTS. On or before the Document Delivery     
Date, Transferor will deliver to Trustee an Account Schedule containing a true  
and complete schedule identifying all such Supplemental Accounts specifying for 
each such Account, as of the Addition Cut Off Date, its account number, the     
aggregate amount outstanding in such Account and the aggregate amount of        
Principal Receivables outstanding in such Account, which Account Schedule shall 
supplement any other Account Schedule previously delivered to Trustee pursuant  
to the Agreement.                                                               

3. CONVEYANCE OF RECEIVABLES. Transferor does hereby transfer, assign, set over 
and otherwise convey to the Trust, for the benefit of the Holders, all its      
right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables of such Supplemental 
Accounts existing at the close of business on the Addition Date and thereafter  
created from time to time until the termination of the Trust, all monies due or 
to become due and all amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds    
thereof. The foregoing does not constitute and is not intended to result in the 
creation or assumption by the Trust, Trustee, any Investor Holder or any        
Enhancement Provider of any obligation of Servicer, Transferor, the Credit Card 
Originator or any other Person in connection with the Accounts, the Receivables 
or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto, including any obligation 
to Obligors, merchant banks, merchants clearance systems or insurers.           

Transferor agrees to record and file, at its own expense, financing 
statements (and continuation statements when applicable) with respect to the    
Receivables now in Supplemental Accounts, meeting the requirements of applicable
state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary to perfect, 
and maintain perfection of, the assignment of such Receivables to the Trust, and
to deliver a file-stamped copy of each such financing statement or other        
evidence of such filing to Trustee on or prior to the Addition Date. Trustee    
shall be under no obligation whatsoever to file or maintain such financing or   
continuation statements or to make any other filing under the UCC in connection 
with such assignment.                                                           

     In connection with such assignment, Transferor further agrees, at its own
expense, on or prior to the date of this Assignment, to cause the Credit Card   
Originator to indicate in the appropriate computer files that Receivables       
created in connection with the Supplemental Accounts and designated hereby have 
been conveyed to the Trust pursuant to the Agreement and this Assignment for the
benefit of the Holders.                                                         

     Transferor does hereby grant to Trustee a security interest in all of its
right, title and interest in and to the Receivables now existing and hereafter  
created in the Supplemental Accounts, all monies due or to become due and all   
amounts received with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof. This Assignment 
constitutes a security agreement under the UCC.                                 

4. ACCEPTANCE BY TRUSTEE. Trustee hereby acknowledges its acceptance on behalf  
of the Trust of all right, title and interest to the property, now existing and 
hereafter created, conveyed to the Trust pursuant to SECTION 3(a) of this       
Assignment, and declares that it shall maintain such right, title and interest, 
upon the trust set forth in the Agreement for the benefit of all Holders.       
Trustee further acknowledges that, prior to or simultaneously with the execution
and delivery of this Assignment, Transferor delivered to Trustee the Account    
Schedule described in SECTION 2 of this Assignment.                             

Exhibit A, Page 2 

P-->EX-4.699th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 99th
5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TRANSFEROR. Transferor hereby represents   
and warrants to Trustee, on behalf of the Trust, as of the date of this         
Assignment and as of the Addition Date that:                                    

            (a) LEGAL, VALID AND BINDING OBLIGATION. This Assignment constitutes
   a legal, valid and binding obligation of Transferor enforceable against
      Transferor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,    
     moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights in general and except as such      
  enforceability may be limited by general principles of equity (whether
considered in a suit at law or in equity);                          

         (b) ELIGIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS. Each Supplemental Account designated
hereby is an Eligible Account;                                      

       (c) INSOLVENCY. As of each of the Addition Cut Off Date and the
Addition Date, no Insolvency Event with respect to the Credit Card  
   Originator or Transferor has occurred and the transfer by Transferor of
      Receivables arising in the Supplemental Accounts to the Trust has not been
made in contemplation of the occurrence thereof;                    

         (d) EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT. Transferor reasonably believes that
    (A) the addition of the Receivables arising in the Supplemental Accounts
      will not, based on the facts known to Transferor, then or thereafter cause
      an Early Amortization Event to occur with respect to any Series and (B) no
    selection procedure was utilized by Transferor which would result in the
 selection of Supplemental Accounts (from among the available Eligible
  Accounts owned by the Credit Card Originator) that would be materially
    less favorable to the interests of the Investor Holders of any Series as
of the Addition Date than a random selection;                       

         (e) SECURITY INTEREST. Either this Assignment constitutes a valid
    transfer and assignment to the Trust of all right, title and interest of
      Transferor in the Receivables and other Trust Assets conveyed to the Trust
      by Transferor and all monies due or to become due and all amounts received
with respect thereto and the proceeds thereof, or this Assignment   
constitutes a grant of a security interest in such property to the  
   Trustee, for the benefit of the Investor Holders, which, in the case of
existing Receivables and the proceeds thereof, is enforceable upon  
    execution and delivery of this Assignment, and which will be enforceable
with respect to such Receivables hereafter created and the proceeds 
   thereof upon such creation. Upon the filing of the financing statements
described in SECTION 3 of this Assignment and, in the case of the   
     Receivables hereafter created and the proceeds thereof, upon the creation
    thereof, the Trust shall have a first priority security interest in such
      property except for Liens permitted under SECTION 2.7(b) of the Agreement;

         (f) NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery by Transferor of this
Assignment, the performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Assignment and the fulfillment of the terms hereof applicable to    
Transferor, will not conflict with or violate any                   

Exhibit A, Page 3 

P-->EX-4.6100th Page of 115TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 100th
    Requirements of Law applicable to Transferor or conflict with, result in
    any breach of any of the material terms and provisions of, or constitute
(with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a material default
 under, any indenture, contract, agreement, mortgage, deed of trust or
 other instrument to which Transferor is a party or by which it or its
properties are bound;                                               

      (g) NO PROCEEDINGS. There are no proceedings or investigations
pending or, to the best knowledge of Transferor, threatened against 
  Transferor before any court, regulatory body, administrative agency or
other tribunal or governmental instrumentality (i) asserting the    
      invalidity of this Assignment, (ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of
      any of the transactions contemplated by this Assignment, (iii) seeking any
   determination or ruling that, in the reasonable judgment of Transferor,
      would materially and adversely affect the performance by Transferor of its
obligations under this Assignment, (iv) seeking any determination or
ruling that would materially and adversely affect the validity or   
    enforceability of this Assignment or (v) seeking to affect adversely the
     income tax attributes of the Trust under the Federal, or applicable state
income or franchise tax systems; and                                

           (h) ALL CONSENTS. All authorizations, consents, orders or approvals
or other actions of any Person or of any court or other governmental
  authority required to be obtained by Transferor in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Assignment by Transferor and the     
performance of the transactions contemplated by this Assignment by  
Transferor, have been obtained.                                     

6. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT. As supplemented by this Assignment, the Agreement 
is in all respects ratified and confirmed and the Agreement as so supplemented  
by this Assignment shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same       
instrument.                                                                     

7. COUNTERPARTS. This Assignment may be executed in two or more counterparts,   
and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which shall be an    
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.        

8. GOVERNING LAW. THIS ASSIGNMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS,  
AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE      
DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or     
other similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of      
creditors, rights in general and except as such enforceability may be limited by
general principles of equity (whether considered in a suit at law or in equity);

     (b) EARLY AMORTIZATION EVENT. Transferor reasonably believes that (A) the
removal of the Receivables existing in the Removed Accounts will not, based on  
the facts known to Transferor, then or thereafter cause an Early Amortization   
Event to occur with respect to any Series and (B) no selection procedure was    
utilized by Transferor which would result in a selection of Removed Accounts    
from among any pools of Accounts of a similar type that would be materially     
adverse to the interests of the Investor Holders of any Series as of the Removal
Date; and                                                                       

(c) LIST OF REMOVED ACCOUNTS. The list of Removed Accounts delivered
pursuant to SECTION 2.9(a)(ii) of the Agreement, as of the Removal Date, is true
and complete in all material respects.                                          

(d) DEFAULTED RECEIVABLES. No selection procedure was utilized by   
Transferor with the intent to include a disproportionately higher level of      
Defaulted Receivables in the Removed Accounts than exist in the Accounts or to  
remove Accounts for the intended purpose of mitigating losses to the Trust.     

Exhibit B, Page 2

     (e) RECEIVABLES TESTS. The aggregate Principal Receivables in the Removed
Accounts did not exceed the lesser of (i) the excess of the Transferor Amount   
over the Minimum Transferor Amount or (ii) the excess of the aggregate amount of
Principal Receivables plus amounts on deposit in the Excess Funding Account over
the Required Principal Balance, all measured as of the end of the most recently 
ended Monthly Period.                                                           

    (f) INVESTED AMOUNTS. Such removal shall not cause a decrease in the sum
of the Invested Amounts for all outstanding Series.                             

5. RATIFICATION OF AGREEMENT. As supplemented by this Reassignment, the         
Agreement is in all respects ratified and confirmed and the Agreement as so     
supplemented by this Reassignment shall be read, taken and construed as one and 
the same instrument.                                                            

6. COUNTERPARTS. This Reassignment may be executed in two or more counterparts, 
and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which shall be an    
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument.        

7. GOVERNING LAW. THIS REASSIGNMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE   
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW         
PROVISIONS, AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER   
SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

 Re:   Purchase of $___________(1) principal amount of World Financial
           Network Credit Card Master Trust, Class __, __% Floating Rate Asset
Backed Certificates, Series                             

Dear Sirs:                                                                      

In connection with our purchase of the above-referenced Asset Backed
Certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") we confirm that:                              

        (i) we understand that the Certificates are not being registered
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and
      are being sold to us in a transaction that is exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act;                                 

         (ii) any information we desire concerning the Certificates or any
    other matter relevant to our decision to purchase the certificates is or
has been made available to us;                                      

    (iii) we have such knowledge and experience in financial and
      business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
    investment in the Certificates, and we (and any account for which we are
     purchasing under PARAGRAPH (iv)) are able to bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Certificates; we (and any account for which we are
  purchasing under PARAGRAPH (iv)) are an "accredited investor" (as such
   term is defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (2) or (3) of Regulation D under the
    Securities Act); and we are not, and none of such accounts is, a Benefit
Plan;                                                               

         (iv) we are acquiring the Certificates for our own account or for
      accounts as to which we exercise sole investment discretion and not with a
view to any distribution                                            

----------                                                                      

(1)   Not less than $250,000 minimum principal amount.                          

Exhibit D-2, Page 1

of the Certificates, subject, nevertheless, to the understanding that the       
disposition of our property shall at all times be and remain within our control;

          (v) we agree that the Certificates must be held indefinitely by us
   unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
   from any registration requirements of that Act and any applicable state
securities laws available;                                          

          (vi) we agree that if at some future time we wish to dispose of or
    exchange any of the Certificates (such disposition or exchange not being
     currently foreseen or contemplated), we will not transfer or exchange any
of the Certificates unless                                          

                  (A) (1) the sale is of at least U.S. $250,000 principal amount
          of Certificates to an Eligible Purchaser (as defined below), (2) a
        letter to substantially the same effect as paragraphs (i), (ii),
            (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this letter is executed promptly by the
            purchaser and (3) all offers or solicitations in connection with the
         sale, whether directly or through any agent acting on our behalf,
            are limited only to Eligible Purchasers and are not made by means of
           any form of general solicitation or general advertising whatsoever;
or                                                      

             (B) the Certificates are transferred pursuant to Rule 144
            under the Securities Act by us after we have held them for more than
three years; or                                         

               (C) the Certificates are sold in any other transaction that
      does not require registration under the Securities Act and, if
            Transferor, Servicer, Trustee or the Transfer Agent and Registrar so
           requests, we theretofore have furnished to such party an Opinion of
 Counsel satisfactory to such party, in form and substance
satisfactory to such party, to such effect; or          

                 (D) the Certificates are transferred pursuant to an exception
           from the registration requirements of the Securities Act under Rule
144A under the Securities Act; or                       

                (E) The Certificates are not transferred to any Benefit Plan
         (as defined below), unless the transferee is an insurance company
        general account that represents and warrants that at the time of
           acquisition and throughout its holding of the certificate (a) it is
  not a service provider to the trust or an affiliate of the
      foregoing, and would not otherwise be excluded under 29 C.F.R.
    2510.3-101(f)(1), and (b) each of the accounts to which such
            certificate is allocated is an insurance company general account (1)
        that is eligible for and meets the requirements of Department of
           Labor Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 95-60 and (2) of which
          less than 25% of the assets are (or represent) assets of a Benefit
Plan.(2)                                                

----------

 FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL WITH RESPECT
TO ADDITION OF SUPPLEMENTAL ACCOUNTS

Provisions to be included in
Opinion of Counsel to be
 delivered pursuant to
SECTION 13.2(d)(ii) or (iii)

      The opinions set forth below may be subject to appropriate qualifications,
assumptions, limitations and exceptions. PARAGRAPHS 1-3 are not required if the 
opinion is being delivered solely under SECTION 13.2(d)(iii).                   

1. The Receivables arising in such Supplemental Accounts constitute 
accounts.                                                                       

  2. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement creates in favor of the Trust a
security interest in Transferor's rights in the Receivables in such Supplemental
Accounts and the proceeds thereof (the "SPECIFIED ASSETS").                     

   3. The security interest in the Specified Assets created by the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement will be perfected by the filing of the Financing        
Statements as described and defined in such opinion. Based solely upon our      
review of the UCC Searches as described and defined in such opinion, we hereby  
confirm to you that no Person other than Trustee has filed any financing        
statement with the Filing Offices as described and defined in such opinion that 
covers the Specified Assets and that would have priority over the security      
interest, if any, of the Trustee by virtue of such filing.                      

     4. No further filings or actions are required under the UCC or other Ohio
law prior to _______, ____ , in order to maintain the perfection and priority of
the security interest created by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement in favor of
the Trust in Transferor's rights in the Receivables and the proceeds thereof.
