Lone Star Funds Announces Final Closing Of LSF X
        																										
              











 News provided by
Lone Star Funds  
Nov 15, 2016, 16:03 ET









 Share this article




























































DALLAS, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Funds today announced that it has completed the final closing for Lone Star Fund X (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Fund X (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSF X").  Total capital available is approximately $5.6 billion, which includes LSF X commitments and an anticipated co-investment from associated entities.
Commitments to LSF X exceeded LSF X's original target of $5 billion.








In April, Lone Star announced it had closed Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSREF V"), its fifth dedicated commercial real estate fund, at approximately $5.8 billion, exceeding its $5 billion fundraising target and reaching its $5.5 billion hard cap for third party commitments.
Lone Star, a global private equity firm, invests on behalf of its limited partners, which include institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, as well as foundations and endowments that support medical research, higher education, and other philanthropic causes.  
Lone Star is a highly disciplined, value-driven investor that focuses on opportunities that emerge during periods of market dislocation, often providing liquidity to markets in the aftermath of a financial crisis.  Lone Star focuses on businesses, sellers, and assets that require capital support and management direction to succeed post-crisis. In this context, Lone Star considers a broad scope of markets, industries, and opportunities through equity and debt investments in value-oriented assets, real estate and real estate-related assets, control investments in operating companies, and securitized products. 
Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has organized seventeen private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments exceeding $70 billion.

 Description


 Technical




The CMP Products Sovereign cable cleat range consists of metallic cable cleats which have been designed, constructed, and tested in accordance with the International Standard ‘cable cleats for Electrical Installations’ IEC 61914:2009. The Sovereign cable cleat has been designed and tested for high short circuit conditions on cables held in trefoil application / formation, to ensure the securing and retention of cables without damage.
The Sovereign cable cleat is available for trefoil application / formation for diameters of 19mm to 128mm in 23 sizes. The cable cleat is fabricated from 316L stainless steel, giving it high creep strength whilst providing excellent corrosion resistance in the harshest of environments.
The Sovereign cable cleat has one M12 and two M10 fixing clearance holes within its base, allowing versatility to the installer during installation, and is designed to enable the product to be secured to a variety of mounting surfaces. The Sovereign cable cleat hinge opens fully, allowing the cables to be easily placed within the cable cleat, to aid the installer before closing and securing via the mouth piece bolt.
Low Smoke & Fume (LFS), Zero Halogen (LS0H) and Phosphorus Free liners are standard helping to restrain the cables within vertical applications, providing a layer of protection between the cable sheath and the cable cleat during normal operation, where thermal elongation of cable occurs, protecting the cable from chafing on any mounting surface due to differential movements such as those found in marine and offshore applications. The Low Smoke & Fume (LSF), Zero Halogen (LS0H) and Phosphorus Free liners also assist in the extra protection of cables in the event of short circuit fault conditions.
