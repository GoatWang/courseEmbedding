	Our disciplined risk management strategy is designed to lock in operating margins by forward contracting the primary commodities involved in or derived from ethanol production: corn, natural gas, ethanol and distillers grains, along with the corn oil extracted prior to the production of distillers grains. We also seek to maintain an environment of continuous operational improvement to increase our efficiency and effectiveness as a low-cost producer of ethanol.

Ethanol

	We are the third largest ethanol producer in the world. We currently operate 17 ethanol plants in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia, with approximately 1.5 billion gallons per year of total ethanol production capacity. At capacity, these plants collectively handle and process 14 million tons of corn and produce over 4.1 million tons of distillers grains annually. LEARN MORE

Distiller Grains

	An important co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers grains. Our ethanol production segment has the capacity to produce approximately 1.5 billion gallons per year of ethanol and as a result, we produce co-products such as wet, modified wet or dried distillers grains. LEARN MORE

Corn Oil

	We are operating corn oil extraction systems at all of our ethanol plants. The corn oil systems we installed are designed to extract non-edible corn oil from the thin stillage evaporation process immediately prior to production of distillers grains. LEARN MORE

Grain Storage

	Green Plains Grain, a wholly owned subsidiary of Green Plains Inc., is a bulk grain storage business. It has 5 facilities across Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas and on-site storage at our ethanol plants. LEARN MORE

Marketing and Distribution

	We market ethanol in different geographic locations around the U.S. and have built an in-house, fee based marketing business that provides ethanol marketing services to other producers in the ethanol industry. LEARN MORE

Cattle

	Green Plains Cattle Company is the fourth largest cattle-feeding operation in the United States with total capacity of more than 255,000 head of cattle at facilities in Colorado, Kansas, and Texas. LEARN MORE

Food Ingredients 

	Green Plains owns a vinegar operation, Fleischmann's Vinegar, which is one of the world's largest producers of food-grade industrial vinegar and includes seven production facilities and and four distribution warehouses. LEARN MORE

Ethanol is a clean-burning, high-octane motor fuel that is produced from renewable sources. At its most basic, 
				ethanol is grain alcohol, produced from crops such as corn. Because it is domestically produced, ethanol helps reduce America's 
				dependence upon foreign sources of energy and creates green jobs in rural areas of the country.

Investor Overview





	Founded in 2004, Green Plains Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRE) is North America's third largest producer of ethanol. Headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, Green Plains has grown rapidly, primarily through acquisitions, and today has operating segments throughout the ethanol value chain.

	Our operations begin upstream with our grain handling segment, continue through our approximately 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol production capacity per year, and ends downstream with our product marketing and distribution. We focus on generating stable operating margins through our diversified business segments and our risk management strategy. We believe that owning and operating assets throughout the ethanol value chain enables us to mitigate the effects of changes in commodity prices on our profitability and differentiates us from companies focused only on ethanol production.

	Green Plains is a vertically integrated ethanol producer based in Omaha, Nebraska. We currently have an ethanol production capacity of approximately 1.5 billion gallons per year with our 17 plants strategically located across the U.S. We also operate an independent third party ethanol marketing business, Green Plains Trade.

Distillers grains are an important co-product of Green Plains’ ethanol production. At capacity our plants will produce approximately 4.1 million tons of distillers grains annually that will be used as a high-protein, high-energy animal fodder and feed supplement. Corn oil is also a co-product of ethanol production that is being extracted at all of our plants. Corn oil is sold to biodiesel manufacturers and to feed lot and poultry markets.

	Green Plains also provides grain storage through our Subsidiary – Green Plains Grain. Green Plains Grain has grain storage capacity of approximately 58 million bushels, including on-site storage at our ethanol plants, that is used to support our grain merchandising activities, as well as our ethanol plant operations. We believe that incorporating this business segment into our operations increases efficiencies and reduces commodity price and supply risks.

	Looking to next generation technology, Green Plains is part of a joint venture called BioProcess Algae to commercialize algae production technology. In addition to Green Plains, the other partners in the venture are CLARCOR Inc. and BioProcess H2O. The project, located at Green Plains in Shenandoah, Iowa, received a grant from the Iowa Office of Energy Independence totaling $4.1 million.

	Ethanol

Ethanol is a chemical produced by the fermentation of sugars found in grains and other biomass.

	Ethanol can be produced from a number of different types of grains, such as corn, wheat and sorghum, as well as from agricultural waste products such as rice hulls, cheese whey, potato waste, brewery and beverage wastes and forestry and paper wastes. At present, the majority of ethanol in the U.S. is produced from corn because corn contains large quantities of carbohydrates and is in greater supply than other grains. Such carbohydrates convert into glucose more easily than most other kinds of biomass.

	Green Plains was formed in June 2004 to construct and operate dry mill, fuel-grade ethanol production plants. Ethanol is a renewable, environmentally clean fuel source that is produced at numerous facilities in the United States, mostly in the Midwest. In the U.S., ethanol is produced primarily from corn and then blended with unleaded gasoline in varying percentages. The ethanol industry in the U.S. has grown significantly over the last few years as its use reduces harmful auto emissions, enhances octane ratings of the gasoline with which it is blended, offers consumers a cost-effective choice, and decreases the amount of crude oil the U.S. needs to import from foreign sources. Ethanol is most commonly sold as E10, the 10 percent blend of ethanol for use in all American automobiles. Increasingly, ethanol is also available as E85, a higher percentage ethanol blend for use in flexible fuel vehicles.

	Operations commenced at our first ethanol plant, located in Shenandoah, Iowa, in late August 2007; the next ethanol plant, located in Superior, Iowa, commenced operations in July 2008; the third ethanol plant to come online is located in Bluffton, Indiana, and began producing ethanol in September 2008; our next ethanol plant to begin production is located in Obion, Tennessee. and had its first grind in November 2008. On July 2, 2009, we acquired two ethanol plants located in Nebraska. The plants are located in Central City and Ord and add 150 million gallons of ethanol production capacity per year. On October 22, 2010, we acquired two plants located in Riga, Michigan and Lakota, Iowa and on March 24, 2011 acquired a plant in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. We acquired our tenth plant in Atkinson, Nebraska in June of 2013. In November 2013 we acquired plants in Wood River, Nebraska and Fairmont, Minnesota. In October 2015, we acquired a plant in Hopewell, Virgina and in November 2015, we acquired an ethanol plant in Hereford, Texas. In September of 2016 we acquired plants in Madison, Illinois, Mount Vernon, Indiana and York, Nebraska. At capacity, our 17 ethanol plants produce a total of approximately 1.5 billion gallons of fuel-grade ethanol annually, making Green Plains the second largest ethanol producer in the world.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
