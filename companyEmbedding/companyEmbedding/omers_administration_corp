OMERS, officially the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, is a pension fund created by statute in 1962 to handle the retirement benefits of local government employees in the Canadian province of Ontario. It has become one of the largest institutional investors in Canada.[1] Over the past 20 years approximately two-thirds of the capital added to the pension fund has been through investment returns, while about 1/3 has been added by contributions split evenly between employees and employers. As of December 2013[update], OMERS had 65.1 billion Canadian dollars in net investment assets.[2] OMERS serves 990 employers and almost 470,000 members, retirees and survivors, including municipal workers, firefighters, police, emergency services staff, Children's Aid Society workers, school board staff (non-teaching), and transit and hydro workers.[1]

Structure[edit]
OMERS is governed by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Act, 2006, an Ontario law which superseded the older Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System Act.
Under the 2006 law, OMERS is composed of two corporations:

The Administration Corporation, formerly known as the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board, is responsible for day-to-day operations, including management of pensions and investments.[3]
The Sponsors Corporation, which represents employer, employee and retiree members of the plan, is responsible for overall plan design and sets the rules for appointment and compensation of its own board and the Administration Corporation board.[3]

Investments[edit]
OMERS has five major investment divisions:[2]

Borealis Infrastructure, which invests in public infrastructure
OMERS Capital Markets, which manages investment in the public markets, such as government bonds and stock in publicly traded companies
OMERS Private Equity, which concentrates on private equity investment
Oxford Properties, which owns real estate such as office buildings and shopping centres
OMERS Strategic Investments, which includes a venture capital arm, OMERS Ventures.

Borealis Infrastructure[edit]
OMERS investment strategy since 2003 has been to increase its investment in infrastructure to 15% from the former 7.9%.[4] In addition to the corporate assets outlined below, Borealis owns 16 school buildings, leased to the Province of Nova Scotia, and 12 nursing home buildings, leased to the Province of Ontario.[5][6]

OMERS, officially the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, is a pension fund created by statute in 1962 to handle the retirement benefits of local government employees in the Canadian province of Ontario. It has become one of the largest institutional investors in Canada.[1] Over the past 20 years approximately two-thirds of the capital added to the pension fund has been through investment returns, while about 1/3 has been added by contributions split evenly between employees and employers. As of December 2013[update], OMERS had 65.1 billion Canadian dollars in net investment assets.[2] OMERS serves 990 employers and almost 470,000 members, retirees and survivors, including municipal workers, firefighters, police, emergency services staff, Children's Aid Society workers, school board staff (non-teaching), and transit and hydro workers.[1]

Structure[edit]
OMERS is governed by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Act, 2006, an Ontario law which superseded the older Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System Act.
Under the 2006 law, OMERS is composed of two corporations:

The Administration Corporation, formerly known as the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board, is responsible for day-to-day operations, including management of pensions and investments.[3]
The Sponsors Corporation, which represents employer, employee and retiree members of the plan, is responsible for overall plan design and sets the rules for appointment and compensation of its own board and the Administration Corporation board.[3]

Investments[edit]
OMERS has five major investment divisions:[2]

Borealis Infrastructure, which invests in public infrastructure
OMERS Capital Markets, which manages investment in the public markets, such as government bonds and stock in publicly traded companies
OMERS Private Equity, which concentrates on private equity investment
Oxford Properties, which owns real estate such as office buildings and shopping centres
OMERS Strategic Investments, which includes a venture capital arm, OMERS Ventures.

Borealis Infrastructure[edit]
OMERS investment strategy since 2003 has been to increase its investment in infrastructure to 15% from the former 7.9%.[4] In addition to the corporate assets outlined below, Borealis owns 16 school buildings, leased to the Province of Nova Scotia, and 12 nursing home buildings, leased to the Province of Ontario.[5][6]

OMERS, officially the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, is a pension fund created by statute in 1962 to handle the retirement benefits of local government employees in the Canadian province of Ontario. It has become one of the largest institutional investors in Canada.[1] Over the past 20 years approximately two-thirds of the capital added to the pension fund has been through investment returns, while about 1/3 has been added by contributions split evenly between employees and employers. As of December 2013[update], OMERS had 65.1 billion Canadian dollars in net investment assets.[2] OMERS serves 990 employers and almost 470,000 members, retirees and survivors, including municipal workers, firefighters, police, emergency services staff, Children's Aid Society workers, school board staff (non-teaching), and transit and hydro workers.[1]

Structure[edit]
OMERS is governed by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Act, 2006, an Ontario law which superseded the older Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System Act.
Under the 2006 law, OMERS is composed of two corporations:

The Administration Corporation, formerly known as the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board, is responsible for day-to-day operations, including management of pensions and investments.[3]
The Sponsors Corporation, which represents employer, employee and retiree members of the plan, is responsible for overall plan design and sets the rules for appointment and compensation of its own board and the Administration Corporation board.[3]

Investments[edit]
OMERS has five major investment divisions:[2]

Borealis Infrastructure, which invests in public infrastructure
OMERS Capital Markets, which manages investment in the public markets, such as government bonds and stock in publicly traded companies
OMERS Private Equity, which concentrates on private equity investment
Oxford Properties, which owns real estate such as office buildings and shopping centres
OMERS Strategic Investments, which includes a venture capital arm, OMERS Ventures.

Borealis Infrastructure[edit]
OMERS investment strategy since 2003 has been to increase its investment in infrastructure to 15% from the former 7.9%.[4] In addition to the corporate assets outlined below, Borealis owns 16 school buildings, leased to the Province of Nova Scotia, and 12 nursing home buildings, leased to the Province of Ontario.[5][6]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
