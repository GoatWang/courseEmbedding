‹ Previous ArticleNext Article ›× BACK TO CFO ARTICLESWhat’s happening in the Healthcare Industry: Mark Altmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer, Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc.
On June 22nd 2010 Mark Altmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, spoke at the Leadership in Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology meeting. The purpose of this talk for Altmeyer was to discuss what is happening in the healthcare industry in the context of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical.
After describing Otsuka as a combination of eastern philosophies and western business values, Altmeyer went on to discuss a few of the long term goals of the company. One of these goals was for Otsuka to become a leading global pharmaceutical company.
Altmeyer went on to discuss how the business model has changed within the company. He continued that, in order to compete in the industry, the company recognized it needed to move away from being a minority partner, and gain the ability to commercialize products.
Altmeyer then spoke for a bit about the methods he used to help the company undergo such a transformation. The first order of business was to upgrade Otsuka’s commercial leadership ability. “I ended up consolidating leadership and expertise in one person to lead all of the sales forces and upgrade all of the capabilities in terms of what we needed both from a sales operations as well as the selling skills perspective.”
Turning to the marketing aspect of the company, Altmeyer stated that he once again believed that consolidation was necessary. “I felt the right principal for us as a small company was to consolidate marketing so that we had one person who was accountable for both global and domestic strategies, had the expertise, and leadership to make sure that the brands were getting the kind of direction and support they needed.”
In an effort to ensure that the company had the right medical strategies, as well as the right sales strategies, Altmeyer then re-located both of those facilities to Princeton, New Jersey, as opposed to having them in different places.
The next area of focus for the company, according to Altmeyer, was to make sure they had the sales force necessary to deliver against expectations. One of the ways this was done was to upgrade and expand Otsuka’s neuroscience sales force.
The second thing that needed to be done, according to Altmeyer, was to expand the hospital sales force in order to ensure success over the long term. This was followed by making strides to better understand the oncology market.
Altmeyer then detailed another area of focus for the company, which was to address the internal organization. This was done with an emphasis on improving efficiency and effectiveness. “To me, it became apparent that we were using a lot of our energy to just drive our internal processes and that we had a real opportunity to pull the organization forward and make some changes to reduce the amount of energy it takes just to get our internal work done.” Altmeyer added that he also concentrated on building the right amount of infrastructure for the amount of product that was expected.
Altmeyer then concluded the main portion of his speech by detailing some of the lessons he learned from this transformation experience. The first thing he mentioned was the importance of management directly speaking to every person impacted by the changes, and letting them know they were a valued member of the team. Altmeyer also said that he believes that being able to connect the work Otsuka does to knowing that they are helping patients deal with diseases is a huge motivating factor.
Altmeyer then took a question from the audience, which prompted him to talk about his personal responsibilities at Otsuka.

Contraindication: Patients should not use ABILIFY if they are allergic to aripiprazole or any of the ingredients in ABILIFY. Allergic reactions have ranged from rash, hives and itching to anaphylaxis, which may include difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue.

Serious side effects may include:

    * An increased risk of stroke and ministroke have been reported in clinical studies of elderly people with dementia-related psychosis
    * Very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate and blood pressure. These may be signs of a condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare but serious side effect which could be fatal
    * Abnormal or uncontrollable movements of face, tongue, or other parts of body. These may be signs of a serious condition called tardive dyskinesia (TD), which could become permanent
    * If you have diabetes, or risk factors for diabetes (for example, obesity, family history of diabetes), or unexpected increases in thirst, urination, or hunger, your blood sugar should be monitored. Increases in blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), in some cases serious and associated with coma or death, have been reported in patients taking ABILIFY® (aripiprazole) and medicines like it 

Lightheadedness or faintness caused by a sudden change in heart rate and blood pressure when rising quickly from a sitting or lying position (orthostatic hypotension) has been reported with ABILIFY.

ABILIFY and medicines like it can affect your judgment, thinking, or motor skills. You should not drive or operate hazardous machinery until you know how ABILIFY affects you.

Medicines like ABILIFY can impact your body's ability to reduce body temperature; you should avoid overheating and dehydration.

ABILIFY and medicines like it have been associated with swallowing problems (dysphagia). If you had or have swallowing problems, you should tell your healthcare professional.

Tell your healthcare professional if you have a history of or are at risk for seizures, or are pregnant or intend to become pregnant, and about all prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking or plan to take, since there are some risks for drug interactions.

While taking ABILIFY, avoid:

    * Drinking alcohol
    * Breast-feeding an infant

Most common side effects (greater than or equal to 10%) from all clinical trials involving adults or pediatric patients include:

    * ADULTS: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, an inner sense of restlessness or need to move (akathisia), anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness

    * PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (10 to 17 years): Extrapyramidal disorder (for example, uncontrolled movement disorders or muscle disturbances such as restlessness, tremors and muscle stiffness), headache, sleepiness, and nausea

It is important to contact your healthcare professional if you experience prolonged, abnormal muscle spasm or contraction which may be signs of a condition called dystonia.

For patients who must limit their sugar intake, ABILIFY Oral Solution contains sugar.

For patients with phenylketonuria or PKU, ABILIFY DISCMELT (aripiprazole) contains phenylalanine.

If you have any questions about your health or medicines, talk to your healthcare professional.
