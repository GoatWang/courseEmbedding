His performance at Mobius was exemplary.  Despite changes in direction and esoteric subject matter, Ray developed expertise in the products and functions he documented through hands-on experience and productive relationships with subject-matter experts.  He developed advanced and thorough understanding of the products and was able to develop useful, well-received training, help systems, and other documentation, usually ahead of schedule.

Ray welcomed challenges and put in any number of hours necessary to complete his projects - without a hint of complaint.  He always exceeded my expectations in quality and volume. Ray remained calm and level-headed no matter how deadlines moved in or workload increased.  His work ethic, desire for excellence, and pleasant demeanor make him an asset to any organization.  

It was my pleasure to have Ray on our Mobius team.  I recommend Ray without hesitation.See moreSee lessRay is an excellent manager and technical writer. As a manager, he is very friendly and easy to work for, yet extremely disciplined and efficient. He is always willing to answer questions (which, coming from me, were many!) or provide assistance without hesitation. As a technical writer, his concern for quality and accuracy is exceptional. I was always impressed by his extensive knowledge of Mobius' products, even those products that he didn't work on directly. In some cases, it seemed he understood the product better than anyone -- including the developers!  I highly recommend Ray and would be glad to provide a more detailed reference to anyone considering him for employment.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended RayView Ray’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Ray directlyView Ray’s Full ProfileNot the Ray you’re looking for?

Bobby Ray Gilbert is a convicted murderer in the Alabama Department of Corrections. Gilbert was arrested on February 22, 1985 for the shooting death of Walton Edison Brewer after a verbal altercation in which the victim refused to satisfy a prior financial agreement with Gilbert.  After shooting Brewer, Gilbert then removed thirty six dollars that was owed to him from the victims wallet.  Although Bobby Gilbert was initially charged with murder during robbery, which is a capital offense and carries the death penalty in the state of Alabama, charges were reduced to first degree murder due to Gilbert leaving $127.00 in the victim’s wallet.  Gilbert openly admitted to his actions and pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
After entering prison with the possibility of parole in ten years, Gilbert proceeded to accumulate one felony conviction after another.  In September of 1986, Gilbert decided that he didn't want to spend the next ten years in prison.  While being housed in the DeKalb county jail in Fort Payne, Alabama, he overpowered the jailer at knifepoint and escaped from custody.  Following a multi-county manhunt, Gilbert was recaptured in a wooded area and taken to a maximum security prison in West Jefferson County in Bessemer,Alabama.  In 1988, while again being housed in the DeKalb county jail, Gilbert attempted yet another escape. After setting fire to the jail and upon being removed from his cell by officers, an altercation between Gilbert and the officers ensued whereupon Gilbert, being armed with a single-edged razor seriously injured one officer and almost killed a second, resulting in his being charged with attempted murder and assault in the first degree.  The arson charge was later dropped as part of the plea agreement. At this point Gilbert had received a ten year sentence for escape, a twenty year sentence for assault and a forty year sentence for attempted murder and was being held in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in Jefferson county, Alabama.
On November 2, 1990, Gilbert was released from solitary confinement and placed into the general population of Donaldson Correctional Facility.  Four weeks after being placed in general population, Gilbert killed a fellow inmate in a knife altercation whereupon he was placed in solitary confinement.  [Under Alabama law, anyone serving a prison sentence for a prior murder conviction who is charged in a second homicide will find it enhanced to a capital offense].  During Gilbert's subsequent trial, court records would indicate that an altercation arose after inmate Andrew Brown refused to follow through with his end of a transaction.  Testimony suggests that Gilbert paid Brown the amount of one carton of cigarettes (inmate currency) to affect a cell change for Gilbert.  When Gilbert discovered that his move to a different cell location had not been approved by the prison administration, he confronted inmate Brown and demanded that Brown pay back the carton of cigarettes.  At this point, Brown refused, threats were exchanged and both men subsequently armed themselves with prison made knives. Testimony by the state's pathologist confirmed the cause of Andrew Brown's death as being multiple stab wounds to the chest, abdomen and back.  In 1992, Gilbert was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.  He would spend a total of seven years in solitary confinement for the death of Andrew Brown, where he would accrue an additional 99 year sentence for promoting prison contraband.
In 1998, Gilbert would be charged with two counts of assault while being housed in the Special Management Unit at Donaldson Correctional Facility. While in the process of stabbing another inmate, he also stabbed an officer who attempted to intervene.  Six years later, Gilbert would once again be released from solitary confinement into another prison's general population; this time in Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. Exactly 61 days later, Gilbert would find himself in yet another violent altercation. This time over an FHM magazine; which led to inmate Harold Cutman being taken from the prison to an outside medical facility where he would receive a total of 273 stitches.  For his part, Gilbert received a black eye and another life sentence for attempted murder.  In 2007, Gilbert would accrue yet another 99 year sentence for promoting prison contraband for the second time.  In July 2008, Bobby "Snake" Gilbert, as he's come to be known amongst his friends, thwarted the execution of death row inmate Thomas Arthur when Gilbert confessed to being the actual killer of Troy Wicker; victim for which Arthur was convicted of murdering. While Arthur remains on death row, authorities continue to disprove Gilbert's claim so as to proceed with Arthur's execution. As of 2014, the issue remains unresolved.
Due to Gilbert's violent nature and assault within the prison system, he spent 22 of the first 25 years in prison in solitary confinement where he developed his latent art skills and as a result was featured on several episodes of MSNBC's Lockup.
9x12drawing done in pencil on arches watercolor paper titled "Art Supplies".  Gilbert signed this piece twice, once on the lined paper "BRG 2016" as well as on the bottom right hand corner "Bobby Gilbert 2016".

Ray Gilbert (5 September 1912, Hartford, Connecticut – 3 March 1976, Los Angeles, California) was an American lyricist.
Career[edit]
Gilbert is best remembered for the lyrics to the Oscar-winning song "Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah" from the film Song of the South, which he wrote with Allie Wrubel in 1947. He also wrote American English lyrics for the songs in The Three Caballeros featuring Donald Duck. To lovers of Brazil's Bossa Nova era, Gilbert is known as an opportunist who garnered English rights to some of the genre's most iconic songs.

Bobby Ray Gilbert is a convicted murderer in the Alabama Department of Corrections. Gilbert was arrested on February 22, 1985 for the shooting death of Walton Edison Brewer after a verbal altercation in which the victim refused to satisfy a prior financial agreement with Gilbert.  After shooting Brewer, Gilbert then removed thirty six dollars that was owed to him from the victims wallet.  Although Bobby Gilbert was initially charged with murder during robbery, which is a capital offense and carries the death penalty in the state of Alabama, charges were reduced to first degree murder due to Gilbert leaving $127.00 in the victim’s wallet.  Gilbert openly admitted to his actions and pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
After entering prison with the possibility of parole in ten years, Gilbert proceeded to accumulate one felony conviction after another.  In September of 1986, Gilbert decided that he didn't want to spend the next ten years in prison.  While being housed in the DeKalb county jail in Fort Payne, Alabama, he overpowered the jailer at knifepoint and escaped from custody.  Following a multi-county manhunt, Gilbert was recaptured in a wooded area and taken to a maximum security prison in West Jefferson County in Bessemer,Alabama.  In 1988, while again being housed in the DeKalb county jail, Gilbert attempted yet another escape. After setting fire to the jail and upon being removed from his cell by officers, an altercation between Gilbert and the officers ensued whereupon Gilbert, being armed with a single-edged razor seriously injured one officer and almost killed a second, resulting in his being charged with attempted murder and assault in the first degree.  The arson charge was later dropped as part of the plea agreement. At this point Gilbert had received a ten year sentence for escape, a twenty year sentence for assault and a forty year sentence for attempted murder and was being held in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in Jefferson county, Alabama. 
On November 2, 1990, Gilbert was released from solitary confinement and placed into the general population of Donaldson Correctional Facility.  Four weeks after being placed in general population, Gilbert killed a fellow inmate in a knife altercation whereupon he was placed in solitary confinement.  [Under Alabama law, anyone serving a prison sentence for a prior murder conviction who is charged in a second homicide will find it enhanced to a capital offense].  During Gilbert's subsequent trial, court records would indicate that an altercation arose after inmate Andrew Brown refused to follow through with his end of a transaction.  Testimony suggests that Gilbert paid Brown the amount of one carton of cigarettes (inmate currency) to affect a cell change for Gilbert.  When Gilbert discovered that his move to a different cell location had not been approved by the prison administration, he confronted inmate Brown and demanded that Brown pay back the carton of cigarettes.  At this point, Brown refused, threats were exchanged and both men subsequently armed themselves with prison made knives. Testimony by the state's pathologist confirmed the cause of Andrew Brown's death as being multiple stab wounds to the chest, abdomen and back.  In 1992, Gilbert was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.  He would spend a total of seven years in solitary confinement for the death of Andrew Brown, where he would accrue an additional 99 year sentence for promoting prison contraband. 
In 1998, Gilbert would be charged with two counts of assault while being housed in the Special Management Unit at Donaldson Correctional Facility. While in the process of stabbing another inmate, he also stabbed an officer who attempted to intervene.  Six years later, Gilbert would once again be released from solitary confinement into another prison's general population; this time in Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. Exactly 61 days later, Gilbert would find himself in yet another violent altercation. This time over an FHM magazine; which led to inmate Harold Cutman being taken from the prison to an outside medical facility where he would receive a total of 273 stitches.  For his part, Gilbert received a black eye and another life sentence for attempted murder.  In 2007, Gilbert would accrue yet another 99 year sentence for promoting prison contraband for the second time.  In July 2008, Bobby "Snake" Gilbert, as he's come to be known amongst his friends, thwarted the execution of death row inmate Thomas Arthur when Gilbert confessed to being the actual killer of Troy Wicker; victim for which Arthur was convicted of murdering. While Arthur remains on death row, authorities continue to disprove Gilbert's claim so as to proceed with Arthur's execution. As of 2014, the issue remains unresolved.
Due to Gilbert's violent nature and assault within the prison system, he spent 22 of the first 25 years in prison in solitary confinement where he developed his latent art skills and as a result was featured on several episodes of MSNBC's Lockup. .

Bobby Ray Gilbert is a convicted murderer in the Alabama Department of Corrections. Gilbert was arrested on February 22, 1985 for the shooting death of Walton Edison Brewer after a verbal altercation in which the victim refused to satisfy a prior financial agreement with Gilbert.  After shooting Brewer, Gilbert then removed thirty six dollars that was owed to him from the victims wallet.  Although Bobby Gilbert was initially charged with murder during robbery, which is a capital offense and carries the death penalty in the state of Alabama, charges were reduced to first degree murder due to Gilbert leaving $127.00 in the victim’s wallet.  Gilbert openly admitted to his actions and pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to life imprisonment.
After entering prison with the possibility of parole in ten years, Gilbert proceeded to accumulate one felony conviction after another.  In September of 1986, Gilbert decided that he didn't want to spend the next ten years in prison.  While being housed in the DeKalb county jail in Fort Payne, Alabama, he overpowered the jailer at knifepoint and escaped from custody.  Following a multi-county manhunt, Gilbert was recaptured in a wooded area and taken to a maximum security prison in West Jefferson County in Bessemer,Alabama.  In 1988, while again being housed in the DeKalb county jail, Gilbert attempted yet another escape. After setting fire to the jail and upon being removed from his cell by officers, an altercation between Gilbert and the officers ensued whereupon Gilbert, being armed with a single-edged razor seriously injured one officer and almost killed a second, resulting in his being charged with attempted murder and assault in the first degree.  The arson charge was later dropped as part of the plea agreement. At this point Gilbert had received a ten year sentence for escape, a twenty year sentence for assault and a forty year sentence for attempted murder and was being held in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in Jefferson county, Alabama. 
On November 2, 1990, Gilbert was released from solitary confinement and placed into the general population of Donaldson Correctional Facility.  Four weeks after being placed in general population, Gilbert killed a fellow inmate in a knife altercation whereupon he was placed in solitary confinement.  [Under Alabama law, anyone serving a prison sentence for a prior murder conviction who is charged in a second homicide will find it enhanced to a capital offense].  During Gilbert's subsequent trial, court records would indicate that an altercation arose after inmate Andrew Brown refused to follow through with his end of a transaction.  Testimony suggests that Gilbert paid Brown the amount of one carton of cigarettes (inmate currency) to affect a cell change for Gilbert.  When Gilbert discovered that his move to a different cell location had not been approved by the prison administration, he confronted inmate Brown and demanded that Brown pay back the carton of cigarettes.  At this point, Brown refused, threats were exchanged and both men subsequently armed themselves with prison made knives. Testimony by the state's pathologist confirmed the cause of Andrew Brown's death as being multiple stab wounds to the chest, abdomen and back.  In 1992, Gilbert was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.  He would spend a total of seven years in solitary confinement for the death of Andrew Brown, where he would accrue an additional 99 year sentence for promoting prison contraband. 
In 1998, Gilbert would be charged with two counts of assault while being housed in the Special Management Unit at Donaldson Correctional Facility. While in the process of stabbing another inmate, he also stabbed an officer who attempted to intervene.  Six years later, Gilbert would once again be released from solitary confinement into another prison's general population; this time in Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama. Exactly 61 days later, Gilbert would find himself in yet another violent altercation.

This review is ONLY for the sales portion of the order.  I went in to buy appliances from Spencer's for our new home (and to help my mom purchase a new fridge for her home).  We were greeted by Tim and he was very easy to work with.  He wasn't the type to hover over your shoulder while you were browsing and I appreciated that.  I asked him several detailed questions and I felt confident in his product knowledge.  When it came time to order, it was easy, I felt the pricing was really great.  I have used Spencer's for several new homes and each time I have added extended warranty on the fridge.  Products just aren't built as well as they were before and I have had to use the warranty in the past.  I have not had issues with any other appliances (washers, microwaves, etc..).  In the past, dealing with their warranty folks was fine.  No issues, and honestly, needing a warranty on fridges is not Spencer's fault, but speaks more to the industry as a whole.  Anyhow, the buying part was great.  Tim gave us a good deal.  Once the new home is built and we deliver, I will update the review on that portion of the experience.  Thanks!







Me and my Husband came here for some new appliances 
The sales guy was nice enough . But here is my issues 
Came back here again and their staff is very uninterested 
And Apathetic in every way !!! Everyone looked miserable .The guy we originally came to see was off . So of course no one really wants to help since they work on commission.
The Apathetic salesman left us for several minutes couldn't honor the price They made a week ago told us we should of put a $100.00 dollars down no one told us that !!! And to comeback !! I've never seen a place more unwilling to make a sale in my life !!! 
Very unpleasant experience save your money go somewhere else!!! By the way we did go somewhere else and just spent $ 2600 !!! Learn some customer service skills Spencer's !!!







I needed a new refrigerator for my new home, and had bought from spencers before in Gilbert. This time I went to spencers on Power Road and Ray.     Tim Brinkerhoff was so nice to me.  When I went back to pay my refrigerator balance, it was marked down even further and he honored that price! Can't ask for more than that.  And I love my refrigerator!







We purchased new kitchen appliances. Microwave,  refrigerator,  dishwasher and gas stove. Best prices compared to Best Buy, Sears with prompt delivery HOWEVER the delivery person did not hook the water to the refrigerator properly and did not return when he said he would. Sales made a mistake and charged us twice for hook up kit but quickly refunded the money as soon as the mistake was realized.
I would have given 5 stars but delivery and install left me disappointed







This review is for the Spencer's USED store only. The gentleman at the front desk was very polite and accommodating. He waited for us to purchase a refrigerator for about an hour after they had already closed. On top of him being so helpful with everything he also gave us an amazing deal and helped my husband load it into our truck. We will refer everyone we know to this location and I am sure we will be back should we need anything else appliance wise. You won't be disappointed!!







Made a fairly large purchase of a LG Washer and Dryer, GE Cafe Fridge and a water softener and RO for approx 6K. When the fridge was delivered we were having an issue with it fitting and we were unsure if it would work or not. The delivery company Spencer's used was horrible. While we were told we would get a call 40 minutes before the guy would only tell me they were "on the way" but literally refused to say where they were coming from which set a bad tone. The guys were extremely rude to my wife and while we were attempting to figure it out the salesperson from Spencer's called me to tell me we had to make a decision if we were keeping it or not. This was literally a 5 minute process and I indicated to the salesperson that everyone could wait a couple minutes while we decided or I would return everything. We decided to return the fridge and had to have it redelivered the following week. 

This was about a month ago and on the 2nd delivery the delivery person pushed the fridge into our. Rand new kitchen cabinets causing a big chunk to be taken out of them. We noticed this shortly after they left and immediately called the salesperson and texted him to which he replied that I had to call the delivery company from the number they called me but we had "accepted" the delivery. Delivery company never responded to us and Spencer's has sent us multiple texts that I would be hearing from them and management to which I have never heard from anyone. 

Additionally we have already had to make two warranty calls on the fridge because the freezer is not working correctly and is thawing and refreezing. Still trying to get that fixed. Also found it the delivery guys left the ice maker in the on position with no water line run to it which the warranty service person said is a huge no-no. 

Washer and dryer seem to work fine, water system is working nicely but the service, delivery and follow up has been a joke. Salesperson shouldn't text me saying I will hear from people if they are all lies. Would never purchase from them again.







Second trip here to buy washer/dryer combo, fridge, tv, water softener & reverse osmosis system. First time here we were just looking cause we had never heard of them before. Jim was fantastic. Answered all our questions both times. Compared models for me & didn't pressure us at all to make the sale. We heard about them by accident & will be coming back for any future appliance needs.







Never again will I purchase anything from Spencers. I purchased a washer and dryer back in 2013. Exactly one year later the washer door randomly stops locking. I call Spencers only to be told in so many words that the machine is not broken enough. The issue continues and I call a few more times and still they will not come out and fix the machine. Well, they CAN, however If they do come out and the machine door lock function just so happens to work they will have to charge me for the visit. What a load of crap! Here's the thing I don't like the idea of having strangers in my home. I am not calling and complaining for fun. I'm calling because after paying $2200 for a washer I would think it should work for more than a YEAR. Fast forward to present day and the washing machine is finally broken. The door has failed to lock for a full day. I call at 9:00 am on a Thursday only to find out that the warranty is not through the company I was referred to by Spencers, so that company gives me the number to call. The next warranty company tells me that they do not have my name on file. Soooooo, they give me ANOTHER number to call and this warranty company gives me the number to some local place for ME to call and schedule an appointment for a technician to come out. The local repair place that I scheduled the appointment with calls me back to tell me that they no longer do work for the warranty company I am with. I call the warranty company back and they give me the number to ANOTHER place. I call them and by now it's 1:00 and they are out to lunch. I finally get a hold of them and the soonest they can be out is Monday. Monday, rolls around and the technician arrives as scheduled. He sees that the door lock is indeed "broken" and tells me that the part needs to be ordered and it will be 2-5 business days before it comes in. And the order for the part will be submitted the next day. Not today (mind you its 11:30am). Okay, deeeep breath... it's now Thursday OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK and I call the repair shop to check on the status. The lady tells me that parts typically take 5-7 business days and not 2-5 as I was told by the technician!!!!!!! Spencers shame on you for such poor service. We got a great deal on the washer and dryer, but I would have gladly paid the extra money if it meant getting a quality item and better service.







We recently moved to the area and shopped around for a new washer, dryer, dishwasher, and double oven.  Spencer's had the best prices by far.  The employees were helpful and attentive, but not pushy which is important to me.  The only bummer was that the washer and dryer were delivered on the same day, but on a different truck from the oven and dishwasher.  The deliveries ended up arriving about three hours apart.  When we set up our delivery I assumed they would all come at the same time so that I wouldn't be sitting in a vacant house waiting for the second half of our order.  It was an inconvenience, but overall I'm happy with our experience.  The appliances are great and I'm happy with what we paid.







This place is horrible.  We purchased a full kitchen package....and a few tv's.  The stove was not working properly so they sent a tech out to look at it.  The stove was not properly insulated and I had burned myself on it the day prior.  I told spencers I wanted a new set.  They said they would replace the stove and I said no way! I paid for a matching set and that is what I want.  There was a gentlemen there that went above and beyond to help us and needless to say the A-hole joke of a manager fired him, after they had picked up the whole set and provided us a new one.  Of course after I threatened a lawsuit for my burn I had got across my stomach.  They also say they price match which is untrue.  We found the same set at Home Depot and when the employee said he would send us a check for the difference he was fired by the cocky, fake Rolex wearing, POS Mercedes driving jerk of a manager.  We will never ever go there again and hopefully you will not either.







Great salespeople...Next day delivery . salespeople know there stuff.Really nice showroom great selection.

We noticed this shortly after they left and immediately called the salesperson and texted him to which he replied that I had to call the delivery company from the number they called me but we had "accepted" the delivery. Delivery company never responded to us and Spencer's has sent us multiple texts that I would be hearing from them and management to which I have never heard from anyone. Additionally we have already had to make two warranty calls on the fridge because the freezer is not working correctly and is thawing and refreezing. Still trying to get that fixed. Also found it the delivery guys left the ice maker in the on position with no water line run to it which the warranty service person said is a huge no-no. Washer and dryer seem to work fine, water system is working nicely but the service, delivery and follow up has been a joke. Salesperson shouldn't text me saying I will hear from people if they are all lies. Would never purchase from them again.

Second trip here to buy washer/dryer combo, fridge, tv, water softener & reverse osmosis system. First time here we were just looking cause we had never heard of them before. Jim was fantastic. Answered all our questions both times. Compared models for me & didn't pressure us at all to make the sale. We heard about them by accident & will be coming back for any future appliance needs.

Never again will I purchase anything from Spencers. I purchased a washer and dryer back in 2013. Exactly one year later the washer door randomly stops locking. I call Spencers only to be told in so many words that the machine is not broken enough. The issue continues and I call a few more times and still they will not come out and fix the machine. Well, they CAN, however If they do come out and the machine door lock function just so happens to work they will have to charge me for the visit. What a load of crap! Here's the thing I don't like the idea of having strangers in my home. I am not calling and complaining for fun. I'm calling because after paying $2200 for a washer I would think it should work for more than a YEAR. Fast forward to present day and the washing machine is finally broken. The door has failed to lock for a full day. I call at 9:00 am on a Thursday only to find out that the warranty is not through the company I was referred to by Spencers, so that company gives me the number to call. The next warranty company tells me that they do not have my name on file. Soooooo, they give me ANOTHER number to call and this warranty company gives me the number to some local place for ME to call and schedule an appointment for a technician to come out. The local repair place that I scheduled the appointment with calls me back to tell me that they no longer do work for the warranty company I am with. I call the warranty company back and they give me the number to ANOTHER place. I call them and by now it's 1:00 and they are out to lunch. I finally get a hold of them and the soonest they can be out is Monday. Monday, rolls around and the technician arrives as scheduled. He sees that the door lock is indeed "broken" and tells me that the part needs to be ordered and it will be 2-5 business days before it comes in. And the order for the part will be submitted the next day. Not today (mind you its 11:30am). Okay, deeeep breath... it's now Thursday OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK and I call the repair shop to check on the status. The lady tells me that parts typically take 5-7 business days and not 2-5 as I was told by the technician!!!!!!! Spencers shame on you for such poor service. We got a great deal on the washer and dryer, but I would have gladly paid the extra money if it meant getting a quality item and better service.

We recently moved to the area and shopped around for a new washer, dryer, dishwasher, and double oven.  Spencer's had the best prices by far.  The employees were helpful and attentive, but not pushy which is important to me.  The only bummer was that the washer and dryer were delivered on the same day, but on a different truck from the oven and dishwasher.  The deliveries ended up arriving about three hours apart.  When we set up our delivery I assumed they would all come at the same time so that I wouldn't be sitting in a vacant house waiting for the second half of our order.  It was an inconvenience, but overall I'm happy with our experience.  The appliances are great and I'm happy with what we paid.

This place is horrible.  We purchased a full kitchen package....and a few tv's.  The stove was not working properly so they sent a tech out to look at it.  The stove was not properly insulated and I had burned myself on it the day prior.  I told spencers I wanted a new set.  They said they would replace the stove and I said no way! I paid for a matching set and that is what I want.  There was a gentlemen there that went above and beyond to help us and needless to say the A-hole joke of a manager fired him, after they had picked up the whole set and provided us a new one.  Of course after I threatened a lawsuit for my burn I had got across my stomach.  They also say they price match which is untrue.  We found the same set at Home Depot and when the employee said he would send us a check for the difference he was fired by the cocky, fake Rolex wearing, POS Mercedes driving jerk of a manager.  We will never ever go there again and hopefully you will not either.

This review is ONLY for the sales portion of the order.  I went in to buy appliances from Spencer's for our new home (and to help my mom purchase a new fridge for her home).  We were greeted by Tim and he was very easy to work with.  He wasn't the type to hover over your shoulder while you were browsing and I appreciated that.  I asked him several detailed questions and I felt confident in his product knowledge.  When it came time to order, it was easy, I felt the pricing was really great.  I have used Spencer's for several new homes and each time I have added extended warranty on the fridge.  Products just aren't built as well as they were before and I have had to use the warranty in the past.  I have not had issues with any other appliances (washers, microwaves, etc..).  In the past, dealing with their warranty folks was fine.  No issues, and honestly, needing a warranty on fridges is not Spencer's fault, but speaks more to the industry as a whole.  Anyhow, the buying part was great.  Tim gave us a good deal.  Once the new home is built and we deliver, I will update the review on that portion of the experience.  Thanks!







Me and my Husband came here for some new appliances 
The sales guy was nice enough . But here is my issues 
Came back here again and their staff is very uninterested 
And Apathetic in every way !!! Everyone looked miserable .The guy we originally came to see was off . So of course no one really wants to help since they work on commission.
The Apathetic salesman left us for several minutes couldn't honor the price They made a week ago told us we should of put a $100.00 dollars down no one told us that !!! And to comeback !! I've never seen a place more unwilling to make a sale in my life !!! 
Very unpleasant experience save your money go somewhere else!!! By the way we did go somewhere else and just spent $ 2600 !!! Learn some customer service skills Spencer's !!!







I needed a new refrigerator for my new home, and had bought from spencers before in Gilbert. This time I went to spencers on Power Road and Ray.     Tim Brinkerhoff was so nice to me.  When I went back to pay my refrigerator balance, it was marked down even further and he honored that price! Can't ask for more than that.  And I love my refrigerator!







We purchased new kitchen appliances. Microwave,  refrigerator,  dishwasher and gas stove. Best prices compared to Best Buy, Sears with prompt delivery HOWEVER the delivery person did not hook the water to the refrigerator properly and did not return when he said he would. Sales made a mistake and charged us twice for hook up kit but quickly refunded the money as soon as the mistake was realized.
I would have given 5 stars but delivery and install left me disappointed







This review is for the Spencer's USED store only. The gentleman at the front desk was very polite and accommodating. He waited for us to purchase a refrigerator for about an hour after they had already closed. On top of him being so helpful with everything he also gave us an amazing deal and helped my husband load it into our truck. We will refer everyone we know to this location and I am sure we will be back should we need anything else appliance wise. You won't be disappointed!!







Made a fairly large purchase of a LG Washer and Dryer, GE Cafe Fridge and a water softener and RO for approx 6K. When the fridge was delivered we were having an issue with it fitting and we were unsure if it would work or not. The delivery company Spencer's used was horrible. While we were told we would get a call 40 minutes before the guy would only tell me they were "on the way" but literally refused to say where they were coming from which set a bad tone. The guys were extremely rude to my wife and while we were attempting to figure it out the salesperson from Spencer's called me to tell me we had to make a decision if we were keeping it or not. This was literally a 5 minute process and I indicated to the salesperson that everyone could wait a couple minutes while we decided or I would return everything. We decided to return the fridge and had to have it redelivered the following week. 

This was about a month ago and on the 2nd delivery the delivery person pushed the fridge into our. Rand new kitchen cabinets causing a big chunk to be taken out of them. We noticed this shortly after they left and immediately called the salesperson and texted him to which he replied that I had to call the delivery company from the number they called me but we had "accepted" the delivery. Delivery company never responded to us and Spencer's has sent us multiple texts that I would be hearing from them and management to which I have never heard from anyone. 

Additionally we have already had to make two warranty calls on the fridge because the freezer is not working correctly and is thawing and refreezing. Still trying to get that fixed. Also found it the delivery guys left the ice maker in the on position with no water line run to it which the warranty service person said is a huge no-no. 

Washer and dryer seem to work fine, water system is working nicely but the service, delivery and follow up has been a joke. Salesperson shouldn't text me saying I will hear from people if they are all lies. Would never purchase from them again.







Second trip here to buy washer/dryer combo, fridge, tv, water softener & reverse osmosis system. First time here we were just looking cause we had never heard of them before. Jim was fantastic. Answered all our questions both times. Compared models for me & didn't pressure us at all to make the sale. We heard about them by accident & will be coming back for any future appliance needs.







Never again will I purchase anything from Spencers. I purchased a washer and dryer back in 2013. Exactly one year later the washer door randomly stops locking. I call Spencers only to be told in so many words that the machine is not broken enough. The issue continues and I call a few more times and still they will not come out and fix the machine. Well, they CAN, however If they do come out and the machine door lock function just so happens to work they will have to charge me for the visit. What a load of crap! Here's the thing I don't like the idea of having strangers in my home. I am not calling and complaining for fun. I'm calling because after paying $2200 for a washer I would think it should work for more than a YEAR. Fast forward to present day and the washing machine is finally broken. The door has failed to lock for a full day. I call at 9:00 am on a Thursday only to find out that the warranty is not through the company I was referred to by Spencers, so that company gives me the number to call. The next warranty company tells me that they do not have my name on file. Soooooo, they give me ANOTHER number to call and this warranty company gives me the number to some local place for ME to call and schedule an appointment for a technician to come out. The local repair place that I scheduled the appointment with calls me back to tell me that they no longer do work for the warranty company I am with. I call the warranty company back and they give me the number to ANOTHER place. I call them and by now it's 1:00 and they are out to lunch. I finally get a hold of them and the soonest they can be out is Monday. Monday, rolls around and the technician arrives as scheduled. He sees that the door lock is indeed "broken" and tells me that the part needs to be ordered and it will be 2-5 business days before it comes in. And the order for the part will be submitted the next day. Not today (mind you its 11:30am). Okay, deeeep breath... it's now Thursday OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK and I call the repair shop to check on the status. The lady tells me that parts typically take 5-7 business days and not 2-5 as I was told by the technician!!!!!!! Spencers shame on you for such poor service. We got a great deal on the washer and dryer, but I would have gladly paid the extra money if it meant getting a quality item and better service.







We recently moved to the area and shopped around for a new washer, dryer, dishwasher, and double oven.  Spencer's had the best prices by far.  The employees were helpful and attentive, but not pushy which is important to me.  The only bummer was that the washer and dryer were delivered on the same day, but on a different truck from the oven and dishwasher.  The deliveries ended up arriving about three hours apart.  When we set up our delivery I assumed they would all come at the same time so that I wouldn't be sitting in a vacant house waiting for the second half of our order.  It was an inconvenience, but overall I'm happy with our experience.  The appliances are great and I'm happy with what we paid.







This place is horrible.  We purchased a full kitchen package....and a few tv's.  The stove was not working properly so they sent a tech out to look at it.  The stove was not properly insulated and I had burned myself on it the day prior.  I told spencers I wanted a new set.  They said they would replace the stove and I said no way! I paid for a matching set and that is what I want.  There was a gentlemen there that went above and beyond to help us and needless to say the A-hole joke of a manager fired him, after they had picked up the whole set and provided us a new one.  Of course after I threatened a lawsuit for my burn I had got across my stomach.  They also say they price match which is untrue.  We found the same set at Home Depot and when the employee said he would send us a check for the difference he was fired by the cocky, fake Rolex wearing, POS Mercedes driving jerk of a manager.  We will never ever go there again and hopefully you will not either.







Great salespeople...Next day delivery . salespeople know there stuff.Really nice showroom great selection.

This review is ONLY for the sales portion of the order.  I went in to buy appliances from Spencer's for our new home (and to help my mom purchase a new fridge for her home).  We were greeted by Tim and he was very easy to work with.  He wasn't the type to hover over your shoulder while you were browsing and I appreciated that.  I asked him several detailed questions and I felt confident in his product knowledge.  When it came time to order, it was easy, I felt the pricing was really great.  I have used Spencer's for several new homes and each time I have added extended warranty on the fridge.  Products just aren't built as well as they were before and I have had to use the warranty in the past.  I have not had issues with any other appliances (washers, microwaves, etc..).  In the past, dealing with their warranty folks was fine.  No issues, and honestly, needing a warranty on fridges is not Spencer's fault, but speaks more to the industry as a whole.  Anyhow, the buying part was great.  Tim gave us a good deal.  Once the new home is built and we deliver, I will update the review on that portion of the experience.  Thanks!

This place is horrible.  We purchased a full kitchen package....and a few tv's.  The stove was not working properly so they sent a tech out to look at it.  The stove was not properly insulated and I had burned myself on it the day prior.  I told spencers I wanted a new set.  They said they would replace the stove and I said no way! I paid for a matching set and that is what I want.  There was a gentlemen there that went above and beyond to help us and needless to say the A-hole joke of a manager fired him, after they had picked up the whole set and provided us a new one.  Of course after I threatened a lawsuit for my burn I had got across my stomach.  They also say they price match which is untrue.  We found the same set at Home Depot and when the employee said he would send us a check for the difference he was fired by the cocky, fake Rolex wearing, POS Mercedes driving jerk of a manager.  We will never ever go there again and hopefully you will not either.
