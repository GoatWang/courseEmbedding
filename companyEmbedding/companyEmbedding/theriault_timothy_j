Job Details
               Company Size: $50 mil to less than $100 mil - Employee Range: 100 to less than 500. Laddawn is a company that provides a better way for distributors to buy high-quality packaging products. But if that were the whole story, we'd all be doing something else. We don't come to work thinking about how many products we can sell and how we can maximize our profits. We come to work thinking about how we can make the experiences of our customers - and our employees - easier, more pleasant and even fun. In short, better. Sometimes it's through a phone call, sometimes it's by providing a seamless online experience. And sometimes it's by opening a warehouse that is closer to our customers. We're passionate about delivering great customer experiences, not because it's a great way to grow our business - which it is - but because it's who we are and what's important to us. We really don't know another way. Or a better way. We only sell to distributors. Do you manufacture your own bags and film?.

Alliance Data








































 













Making data actionable









Data — it’s what drives our business. We analyze millions of pieces of data and translate them into meaningful insights for our clients. That means bigger sales, stronger customer relationships, and sustained brand loyalty.










Doing good things that matter









We’re more than just our business results. We are equally committed to our associates, our communities, the environment, and the secure and responsible use of data. These responsibilities are not just important — they’re essential to who we are.










Using technology to save lives









Every second counts when lives are at stake. When a child is reported missing, or when there’s a severe weather warning, it is our brands’ technology that helps push millions of messages directly to people who need to know.










Strengthening our clients’ brands









With 300 million loyalty members worldwide, we like to think of ourselves as the ultimate matchmaker. We connect our clients’ brands with the right customer, at the right time, with the right message through the right device.








 







Who We Are






Harnessing the  power  of data to deliver business results 

You might not know our name, but you’ve seen what we do. Alliance Data is the engine behind loyalty and marketing campaigns for more than 1,000 consumer-facing companies worldwide across all industries: retail, travel, pharmaceutical, financial services, auto, and more.
In its own unique way, each of our three businesses better connects consumers with the brands they already love. And, we don’t do it through guesswork. We truly understand millions of individual consumers and their habits through our data analysis expertise. We understand where people like to shop, what device they like to use, the time of day they prefer to shop, what they’re shopping for, and the specific message that will interest them in a purchase.
That data-driven insight enables us to build dynamic and creative loyalty marketing programs and strengthen and deepen relationships between our clients and their customers. In today’s changing-by-the-minute digital landscape, that’s more crucial than ever.







Our Businesses







Card Services
Epsilon
LoyaltyOne







At Alliance Data’s card services business, we know 40 million consumers. How? They carry one (or more) of our clients’ branded credit cards, either in their wallet or on their mobile device. We manage more than 160 branded credit programs — private label, co-brand, and commercial — for the world’s most recognizable brands.
So, what does that mean exactly? When you use your Caesars Entertainment, Pottery Barn, J. Crew, or Victoria’s Secret credit card (just to name a few), that’s actually us. We capture transactional data, then use it to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the ties between our clients and their customers. We also talk directly to consumers, providing outstanding and industry-leading customer care as part of the branded credit program. This combination translates to highly effective, multi-channel marketing communications for our clients. We also create incentives that drive sales, engage cardholders, and foster long-term brand loyalty.







Epsilon is a next generation marketing agency. We take a unique approach to managing the entire customer marketing lifecycle, as well as some of the world’s largest consumer databases for Fortune 1000 companies. By harnessing the power of rich data, world-leading technologies, creativity, and transformative ideas, our teams create multi-channel, tailored marketing solutions for our clients.
We play across every industry, from automotive and telecommunications to healthcare, travel, and entertainment. Our clients include nine of the top 10 banks, eight of the top 10 retailers, the 10 largest pharmaceutical companies, and the largest automakers.
With the science fueled by our Conversant business, a global leader in cross-device matching technology and user-to-device accuracy, we’re able to connect our clients and brands to 263 million consumers across computers, smartphones, tablets, and connected TVs.
Technology + Creative = Epsilon, the #1-ranked U.S. agency across all disciplines by  Ad Age  five years in a row.







LoyaltyOne is an expert in creating coalition loyalty programs and stand-alone loyalty rewards. We built our expertise through one of the most successful coalition loyalty programs on the planet — Canada’s AIR MILES® Reward Program. We bring together your grocer, your pharmacy, your gas station, and other retailers under one coalition loyalty program, which allows consumers to earn points and rewards for their everyday purchases. With approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participating, the AIR MILES Reward Program has been named one of the most influential brands in Canada.
We’ve also helped grow Latin America’s largest and fastest growing coalition program, dotz.  Under our leadership, dotz has evolved into a full-scale retail coalition, partnering with some of Brazil’s top brands and more than 14 million collectors to date.
Finally, Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty transforms casual shoppers into loyal customers through tailor-made, stand-alone loyalty programs. These programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers around the world.

Ed is the architect of the Company’s unique business model, which, through its three businesses, offers a full suite of data-driven, targeted marketing solutions through three primary lines of business balanced to navigate through economic cycles, delivering consistent strong financial performance.
As he continues to grow the business, Ed is also committed to continuously raising the company’s corporate responsibility goals, with the belief that Alliance Data must deliver beyond financial performance to maintain its reputation as a responsible corporate citizen. He is a champion of the Company’s corporate giving efforts. An active community advocate for children’s health and education, Ed serves on the board of directors for Children’s Health System of Texas. He is also a member of the board and Long-Range Planning Committee of the Shelton School, a Dallas private school for children with learning differences. He supports the Plano Independent School District (PISD) Foundation in the North Texas area, and is a member of the PISD CEO Council.
