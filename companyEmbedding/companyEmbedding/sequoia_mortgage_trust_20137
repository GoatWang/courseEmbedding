      Fitch Rates Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-7
    





May 23, 2013 11:34 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-7, mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2013-7 (SEMT 2013-7):
    

      --$125,000,000 class A-1 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$298,878,000 class A-2 certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$125,000,000 class A-IO1 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$423,878,000 class A-IO2 notional certificate 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,165,000 class B-1 certificate 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$7,711,000 class B-2 certificate 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$6,577,000 class B-3 certificate 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$2,494,000 non-offered class B-4 certificate 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 6.55% 
      subordination provided by the 1.80% class B-1, 1.70% class B-2, 1.45% 
      class B-3, 0.55% non-offered class B-4 and 1.05% non-offered class B-5. 
      The $4,763,656 non-offered class B-5 certificates will not be rated by 
      Fitch.
    

      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party underwriters. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. will act 
      as the master servicer and Wilmington Trust will act as the Trustee for 
      the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections will be made 
      to treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage investment 
      conduits (REMICs).
    

      SEMT 2013-7 will be Redwood Residential Acquisition Corporation's 
      seventh transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2013. The 
      certificates are supported by a pool of prime fixed rate mortgage loans. 
      All but 0.8% of the loans are fully amortizing. The aggregate pool 
      included loans originated from Cole Taylor Bank (7.8%), PrimeLending 
      (6.7%), George Mason (5.8%), and WJ Bradley Mortgage Capital (5.5%). The 
      remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage 
      lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 595 loans with a 
      total balance of $453,588,656; an average balance of $762,334; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 66.9%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.8%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 60.6% and 7.6% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 770. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 96.2% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (41.8%), 
      Texas (9.8%) and Massachusetts (5.5%).
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High-Quality Mortgage Pool: The collateral pool consists primarily of 
      30-year fixed-rate fully documented loans to borrowers with strong 
      credit profiles, low leverage, and substantial liquid reserves. All but 
      0.8% of the loans are fully amortizing. Third-party loan-level due 
      diligence was conducted on 98% of the overall pool, and Fitch believes 
      the results of the review generally indicate strong underwriting 
      controls.
    

      Originators With Limited Performance History: The majority of the pool 
      was originated by lenders with limited non-agency performance history. 
      While the significant contribution of loans from these originators is a 
      concern, Fitch believes the lack of performance history is partially 
      mitigated by the 100% third-party diligence conducted on these loans 
      that resulted in immaterial findings. Fitch also considers the credit 
      enhancement (CE) on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the 
      originator risk.
    

      Geographically Diverse Pool: The collateral pool is geographically 
      diverse. The percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas 
      (MSAs) is 23.2% and concentration in California is 41.8% which is 
      similar compared to recent SEMT transactions. The agency did not apply a 
      default penalty to the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk.
    

      Transaction Provisions Enhance Performance: As in other recent SEMT 
      transactions rated by Fitch, SEMT 2013-7 contains binding arbitration 
      provisions that may serve to provide timely resolution to representation 
      and warranty disputes. In addition, all loans that become 120 days or 
      more delinquent will be reviewed for breaches of representations and 
      warranties.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch's analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how 
      the ratings would react to steeper market value declines (MVDs) than 
      assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and national 
      levels. The implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some 
      of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that 
      the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the 
      surveillance of the transaction.
    

      Fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected 
      lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool. The 
      model currently projects sustainable MVDs (sMVDs) at the MSA level. For 
      two of the top 10 regions, Fitch's SHP model does not project declines 
      in home prices. These regions are Dallas-Plano-Irving in Texas (4.7%), 
      and Chicago-Joliet-Naperville in Illinois (4.6%). Fitch conducted 
      sensitivity analysis assuming sMVDs of 10%, 15%, and 20% compared with 
      those projected by Fitch's SHP model for these regions. The sensitivity 
      analysis indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario.
    

      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 13.6% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    

      Additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue 
      report 'Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-7'.
    

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      In addition to the information sources identified in Fitch's criteria 
      listed below, Fitch's analysis incorporated data tapes, due diligence 
      results, deal structure and legal documents from the 17g5 website

Fannie Mae: from legacy to startup


        You'd be forgiven for thinking that a quasi-federal agency founded in the 1930s is the last place youâd describe using words like innovative or agile. But youâd be wrong. Defying all stereotypes, Fannie Maeâs recent actions read a lot more like a startup than a $2.8 billion company with more than 7,000 employees. In the last two years, the company has implemented a user experience strategy, adopted design thinking and accelerated time to market for an innovative array of products.

Prime status: an update on luxury residential real estate


Deborah Huso


Real Estate


        In the years leading up to the housing bubble of 2007, it seemed like everyone was getting a piece of the American Dream of homeownership (or maybe even second homeownership). Ten years after the Great Recession, how is luxury residential real estate faring? Was the recent market slowdown just a temporary blip on the radar and will the sector continue to draw the aspirational interest of buyers as it did in the early to mid-2000s?
      


Commentary

Convert leads like a top producer



Casey Cunningham


Lending


        Most mortgage professionals know that the client feels a sense of loyalty to the first person they speak with. When they establish themselves as the first contact, loan officers gain a critical sales advantage. In fact, speed-to-call is the single largest driver of conversion for new customer leads.Â 
Studies show that returning a call from a new customer within the first 30 minutes produces an average of a 62% increase in conversion rates.

Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-7 Certificates | Business Wire
























































Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to Sequoia Mortgage 
      Trust 2013-7 Certificates






May 23, 2013 11:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns final ratings to eight classes 
      of mortgage pass-through certificates from Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2013-7, a jumbo prime RMBS transaction. Concurrently we have withdrawn 
      our preliminary ratings on the certificates, which were assigned on May 
      13, 2013.
    

      The mortgage pool backing SEMT 2013-7 is comprised of 595 first-lien 
      mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $453,588,656 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans in the pool are all fixed-rate mortgages, 
      with 30-year maturities and eight 20-year maturity. Three of the loans 
      are interest-only, two for 10 years and one for 11 years. The pool is 
      characterized by substantial borrower equity in each mortgaged property, 
      as evidenced by the weighted average LTV (66%) and CLTV (67%). The 
      weighted average credit score of the mortgage pool is 770, which is well 
      within the prime mortgage range. The SEMT 2013-7 pool is also notable 
      for significantly higher loan seller and geographic diversity than prior 
      KBRA-rated SEMT transactions.
    

      KBRA's analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the 
      mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, 
      together with a review of the key transaction parties, results of loan 
      file reviews performed by independent third party firms and review of 
      the legal structure and key documentation. This analysis is further 
      described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.
    

      For complete details on the analysis, please see our Pre-Sale Report, 
      Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2013-7, which was published on May 13th 2013 at www.krollbondratings.com.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
