Ms. Camilli is the Founder and Principal of Camilli Economics LLC, providing corporations with detailed economic analysis to assist in their strategic plans and investment objectives. She has more than two decades of private and public sector experience and is a leading economic forecaster and independent economist.
“Our Board is made up of experienced, knowledgeable and influential professionals from a variety of backgrounds,” said Goldring. “This diversity enables the Board to bring perspective and insight to ensure our financial and corporate well-being.”

Ms. Camilli is a member of the Economic Club of New York, the National Association of Corporate Directors, the National Association of Business Economists and the Forecasters Club. She received her BA degrees in both Economics and French from Douglass College, Rutgers University. She earned an MBA in Finance and an MA in French Studies from New York University.

               Already, Tactile Finance enables borrowers to create and compare different financial scenarios, such as selling or refinancing, to determine which route best suits their financial goals. But the company's new features allow borrowers to compare options that have adjustable, insurance and other fee components that typically make the mortgage shopping process cumbersome or difficult to digest. "As our product has evolved, we have stayed true to our mission of eliminating consumers' confusion about mortgage product selection and enabling professionals to deliver high-quality service and outcomes," Nicole Hamilton, Tactile Finance's CEO, said. "This helps move us closer to our long-term goals. It also makes our technology available to a wider audience." Users can now input any mortgage product into Tactile Finance's system, including interest-only or adjustable-rate mortgages, as well as related items such as fees and insurance, so consumers can visualize how their payments will be affected over time. For example, mortgage lenders can load in all of their products and get a clear display of the loan over time. At the same time, they can compare it to other loan products for both purchase and refinance mortgages.
