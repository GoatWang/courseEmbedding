	The primary asset of Discover Card Execution Note Trust (the 

	Note Issuance Trust

	) is the Discover Card Master Trust I, Series 2007-CC collateral certificate, which represents an
	undivided interest in Discover Card Master Trust I (the 

	Master Trust

	), whose assets include Discover Card receivables existing as of specified dates in designated accounts, which receivables have been transferred to the Master
	Trust by Discover Bank. The investor interest in receivables for the collateral certificate reflects the aggregate nominal liquidation amount of notes issued by the Note Issuance Trust. The Master Trust, therefore, may be considered a significant
	obligor in relation to the Note Issuance Trust. Pursuant to Instruction 3.b. to Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB, the information required by Instruction J to Form 10-K in respect of the Master Trust has been disclosed in this report on Form 10-K
	in lieu of the information otherwise contemplated by Item 1112(b).

	Item 1117 of Regulation AB. Legal Proceedings.





	In the normal course of business, from time to time, Discover Bank and/or one or more its affiliates have been named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and
	other litigation, arising in connection with our activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Discover Bank contests
	liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter.




	Discover Bank has historically relied on the
	arbitration clause in its cardmember agreements, which has in some instances limited the costs of, and our exposure to, litigation, but there can be no assurance that Discover Bank will continue to be successful in enforcing the arbitration clause
	in the future. Legal challenges to the enforceability of these clauses have led most card issuers and may cause Discover Bank to discontinue their use. In addition, bills







	are periodically introduced in Congress to directly or indirectly prohibit the use of pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to conduct a study on pre-dispute
	arbitration clauses and, based on the study, potentially limit or ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses. Further, Discover Bank and/or one or more of its affiliates are involved in pending legal actions challenging the arbitration clause.




	Discover Bank and its affiliates are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and
	informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business, including, among other matters, accounting, tax and operational matters, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, decreases in regulatory
	ratings or other relief, which could materially impact Discover Banks financial results, increase its cost of operations, or limit its ability to execute its business strategies and engage in certain business activities. Litigation and
	regulatory actions could also adversely affect Discover Banks reputation.




	On August 16, 2011, the Attorney General
	of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against Discover in the Circuit Court of Mason County, West Virginia (West Virginia v. Discover Financial Services, Inc., Discover Bank, DFS Services LLC et al.). The lawsuit asserts various claims related to
	Discovers marketing and administration of various fee based products under West Virginia law. The relief sought in the lawsuit includes an injunction prohibiting Discover from engaging in the alleged violations, restitution and disgorgement of
	monies received from the complained of practices, civil penalties and costs. Discover will seek to vigorously defend all claims asserted against it in this matter.




	On August 26, 2011, the Attorney General of Missouri issued a request for information to Discover Financial Services in connection with an investigation to determine whether Discover has engaged in
	conduct that violates Missouri law in the marketing of Discover Payment Protection to credit card customers. Discover is cooperating with the Attorney General in the investigation.




	On November 30, 2011, a class action lawsuit was filed against Discover Financial Services by a Discover Bank cardmember in the U.S.
	District Court for the Northern District of California (Walter Bradley et al. v. Discover Financial Services). The plaintiff alleges that Discover contacted him, and members of the class he seeks to represent, on their cellular telephones without
	their express consent in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Plaintiff seeks statutory damages for alleged negligent and willful violations of the TCPA, attorneys fees, costs and injunctive relief. The TCPA
	provides for statutory damages of $500 for each violation ($1,500 for willful violations).




	On March 6, 2012, a class
	action lawsuit was filed against Discover Financial Services by a Discover Bank cardmember in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Andrew Steinfeld v. Discover Financial Services, DFS Services LLC and Discover Bank). The
	plaintiff alleges that Discover contacted him, and members of the class he seeks to represent, on their cellular telephones without their express consent in violation of the TCPA. Plaintiff seeks statutory damages for alleged negligent and willful
	violations of the TCPA, attorneys fees, costs and injunctive relief. The TCPA provides for statutory damages of $500 for each violation ($1,500 for willful violations).




	On April 12, 2012, the Attorney General of Hawaii filed a lawsuit against Discover in the Circuit Court of the First Circuit, Hawaii (Hawaii v. Discover Financial Services, Inc., Discover Bank, DFS
	Services LLC et al.). The lawsuit asserts various claims related to Discovers marketing and administration of various fee based products under Hawaii law. The relief sought in the lawsuit includes an injunction prohibiting Discover from
	engaging in the alleged violations, restitution and disgorgement of monies received from the complained of practices, civil penalties and costs. Discover will seek to vigorously defend all claims asserted against it.




	On June 28, 2012, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed a lawsuit against Discover in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial
	District of Hinds County, Mississippi (Mississippi v. Discover Financial Services, Inc., Discover Bank, DFS Services LLC et al.). The lawsuit asserts various claims related to Discovers marketing and administration of various fee based
	products under Mississippi law. The relief sought in the lawsuit includes an injunction prohibiting Discover from engaging in the alleged violations, restitution and disgorgement of monies received from the complained-of practices, civil penalties
	and costs. Discover will seek to vigorously defend all claims asserted against it.




	On September 24, 2012, Discover Bank
	entered into a consent order with the FDIC and the CFPB for resolution of the agencies joint investigation with respect to the marketing of Discover Banks protection products. The order requires Discover Bank to provide refunds of
	approximately $200 million to eligible customers who purchased certain protection products between December 1, 2007 and August 31, 2011. In addition, Discover Bank




	 




	2







	agreed to pay a $14 million civil monetary penalty to the agencies. Discover Bank also agreed to make further enhancements to its quality control and other processes related to the marketing,
	sale and administration of its protection products. Discover Bank agreed to enter into the consent order for the purpose of resolving this matter and, in doing so, did not admit or deny the findings of fact, conclusions of law, or any violations of
	law or regulation, set forth in the order.

	Discover Bank, which acts as seller/depositor for the Master Trust, depositor and beneficiary for the Note
	Issuance Trust and the sponsor of their securitizations, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Discover Financial Services. Discover Financial Services acquired Discover Bank in January 1985. Discover Bank and the trustee for the Master Trust formed the
	Master Trust in October 1993. Discover Bank originates and has transferred to the Master Trust, since its formation, the credit card receivables generated under certain designated Discover card accounts. Discover Bank and the owner trustee formed
	the Note Issuance Trust on July 2, 2007. Discover Bank transferred an undivided




	 




	3







	interest in the receivables and other assets of the Master Trust, represented by the collateral certificate, to the Note Issuance Trust to support the issuance of notes on July 26, 2007.




	Discover Bank acts as master servicer for the Master Trust and is currently the only servicer under the Pooling and Servicing
	Agreement with respect to the receivables. Discover Bank has outsourced certain servicing functions to the following affiliates: DB Servicing Corporation (

	DBSC

	) and Discover Products Inc. (

	DPI

	). DBSC has
	contracted with BancTec, Inc., a third party service provider, for certain check processing and related services. However, Discover Bank is ultimately responsible for the overall servicing function. DBSC and DPI are held directly by Discover Bank.
	Discover Bank also acts as calculation agent for the Note Issuance Trust, which is part of the servicing function.




	DRFC
	Funding LLC (

	DRFC

	) is an indirect subsidiary of Discover Bank. DRFC is a special purpose entity whose purpose is to provide credit enhancement for the benefit of certificateholders of previously issued series of Master Trust
	certificates. DRFC will not provide credit enhancement for the collateral certificate or the notes unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.





	Item 1122 of Regulation AB. Compliance with Applicable Servicing Criteria.





	Each of Discover Bank, DPI, DBSC, BancTec, Inc. and U.S. Bank National Association (each, a 

	Servicing Participant

	) has been identified by the registrant as a party participating in the
	servicing function during the reporting period with respect to the pool assets held by each of the Master Trust and the Note Issuance Trust. Each of the Servicing Participants has completed a report on an assessment of compliance with the servicing
	criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant (each, a 

	Report on Assessment

	) during the Note Issuance Trusts fiscal year ending November 30, 2012, which Reports on Assessment are attached as exhibits to this Form
	10-K. In addition, each of the Servicing Participants has provided an attestation report (each, an 

	Attestation Report

	) by a registered independent public accounting firm regarding its related Report on Assessment. Each Attestation
	Report is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. None of the Reports on Assessment or the related Attestation Reports has identified any material instances of noncompliance with the servicing criteria applicable to such Servicing Participant
	described in the related Report on Assessment.





	Item 1123 of Regulation AB. Servicer Compliance Statement.





	Each of Discover Bank, DPI, DBSC and BancTec, Inc. has been identified by the registrant as a servicer during the reporting period with

	Exhibit 33.1






	Managements Assertion on






	Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria





	Discover Bank (Discover Bank or the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing its compliance,
	as of and for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2012 (the Reporting Period), with the servicing criteria applicable to it in connection with the Second Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of June 4,
	2010, as amended, by and between Discover Bank and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, and the Series Supplement for Series 2007-CC dated as of July 26, 2007, as amended, with respect to the Discover Card Execution Note Trust. The
	Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Items 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), (d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(2)(vi), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(i),
	(d)(4)(iv), (d)(4)(vi), (d)(4)(vii), (d)(4)(viii), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable to the activities it performs
	with respect to the asset-backed securities transactions covered by this report (such applicable criteria, after giving effect to the exclusions identified above, the Applicable Servicing Criteria), to assess such compliance. The
	transactions covered by this report include all asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables conducted by Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust that were registered with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or were not required to be registered where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period (the Platform), as listed in
	Appendix A.




	Discover Bank has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period
	and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report for the Platform on

	Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria





	Discover Products Inc. (DPI or the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing its compliance,
	as of and for the year ended November 30, 2012 (the Reporting Period), with the servicing criteria applicable to it in connection with the Servicing Agreement dated January 1, 2011 by and between DPI and Discover Bank. The
	Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Items 1122 (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(2)(vi), (d)(2)(vii),
	(d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(4)(iii), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable to the
	activities it performs with respect to the asset-backed securities transactions covered by this report (such applicable criteria, after giving effect to the exclusions identified above, the Applicable Servicing Criteria), to assess such
	compliance. The transactions covered by this report include all asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables conducted by Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust that were registered with the
	Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or were not required to be registered where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period (the Platform), as listed
	in Appendix A.




	DPI has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period and has
	concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report for the Platform on
	the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

	Managements Assertion on






	Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria





	DB Servicing Corporation (DBSC or the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing its
	compliance, as of and for the year ended November 30, 2012 (the Reporting Period), with the servicing criteria applicable to it in connection with the Servicing Agreement dated January 1, 2011 by and between DBSC and Discover
	Bank. The Asserting Party used the criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB, excluding the criteria set forth in Items 1122 (d)(1)(i), (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), (d)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(2)(vi),
	(d)(2)(vii), (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(ii), (d)(4)(iii), (d)(4)(v), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), and (d)(4)(xv) of Regulation AB, which the Asserting Party has concluded are not applicable
	to the activities it performs with respect to the asset-backed securities transactions covered by this report (such applicable criteria, after giving effect to the exclusions identified above, the Applicable Servicing Criteria), to
	assess such compliance. The transactions covered by this report include all asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables conducted by Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust that were registered
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or were not required to be registered where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period (the Platform),
	as listed in Appendix A.




	With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(iv) for the Reporting Period
	defined above, the Asserting Party has engaged vendors to perform certain limited payment activities required by these servicing criteria. With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii) for the Reporting Period defined
	above, the Asserting Party has engaged vendors to perform the collection activities required by these servicing criteria for a limited number of accounts that were delegated to such vendors. The Asserting Party has determined that none of these
	vendors engaged for either payment or collection activities is a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Asserting Party has elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria
	applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (Interpretation 17.06). The Asserting Party has policies and procedures in
	place to provide reasonable assurance that each vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to such vendor.




	DBSC has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, including servicing criteria for which compliance is determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, for the Reporting
	Period and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.







	Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued
	an attestation report for the Platform on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Reporting Period as set forth in this assertion.

	Managements Assertion on






	Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria





	BancTec, Inc. (BancTec or the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing its compliance, as of
	and for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2012 (the Reporting Period), with certain servicing criteria applicable to it in connection with the Services Agreement dated as of September 30, 2008, as amended, (the Services
	Agreement) between BancTec, Inc. and DB Servicing Corporation (DBSC), assignee of, DFS Services LLC. The Asserting Party used the selected criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(2)(i) and (d)(4)(iv) (such applicable criteria, as
	discussed below, the Applicable Servicing Criteria), to assess such compliance with respect to support services provided to DBSC. The transactions covered by this report include all asset-backed securities transactions involving credit
	card receivables conducted by Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust that were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or were not required to be
	registered where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period (the Platform).




	BancTec does not have sole responsibility for either of the Applicable Servicing Criteria, but instead provides support services to DBSC
	and Discover Bank that are necessary to their compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria. Specifically, BancTec is responsible for (a) capturing data with respect to cardmember payments and associated checks, (b) transmitting such
	data to DBSC and Discover Bank on a timely basis consistent with their compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria; and (c) delivering certain of such checks to a third party financial institution for deposit into a bank account held in
	the name of Discover Bank. BancTec is not responsible for (x) ensuring that deposits are posted to Discover Banks bank accounts, (y) following up with regard to unposted deposits, and (z) posting payments to any
	cardmembers account. BancTec has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, to the extent it is responsible for such aspects of such compliance, and has concluded that the Asserting Party has complied, in all material
	respects, with those aspects of the Applicable Servicing Criteria for which it is responsible for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.




	Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report for the Platform on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

	New Castle, DE




	We have examined
	managements assertion, included in the accompanying Managements Assertion on Compliance with Regulation AB Criteria, that Discover Bank (the Bank) complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
	Securities and Exchange Commissions Regulation AB for the asset-backed securities transactions involving credit card receivables conducted by Discover Card Master Trust I and Discover Card Execution Note Trust (the Platform) as of
	and for the year ended November 30, 2012, excluding the criteria set forth in Items 1122 (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), (d)(2)(iii), (d)(2)(iv), (d)(2)(v), (d)(2)(vi), (d)(3)(iii), (d)(3)(iv), (d)(4)(i), (d)(4)(iv), (d)(4)(vi), (d)(4)(vii),
	(d)(4)(viii), (d)(4)(ix), (d)(4)(x), (d)(4)(xi), (d)(4)(xii), (d)(4)(xiii), (d)(4)(xiv), and (d)(4)(xv), which management has determined are not applicable to the activities performed by the Bank with respect to the Platform. Appendix A to
	managements assertion identifies the individual asset backed-transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for the Banks compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
	express an opinion on managements assertion about the Banks compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.




	Our
	examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on
	a test basis, evidence about the Banks compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether the Bank performed those selected activities
	in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by the Bank during
	the period covered by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising
	from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Bank during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable
	basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Banks compliance with the servicing criteria.




	In
	our opinion, managements assertion that the Bank complied with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended November 30, 2012, for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

	Appendix A to managements assertions identifies the individual asset backed-transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible for DBSCs compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on managements assertions about DBSCs compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.




	Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by
	the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about DBSCs compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample basis of the servicing
	activities related to the Platform, determining whether DBSC performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria during the specified period, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
	circumstances. Our procedures were limited to selected servicing activities performed by DBSC during the period covered by this report and accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction
	included in the Platform. Further, an examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by DBSC
	during the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on DBSCs compliance with the servicing criteria.




	As described in managements assertion, for servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(vii) and 1122(d)(4)(viii), DBSC has engaged
	vendors to perform certain activities required by this servicing criteria. DBSC has determined that these vendors are not considered a servicer as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and DBSC has elected to take responsibility
	for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to these vendors as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (Interpretation 17.06). As
	permitted by Interpretation 17.06, DBSC has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria applicable to
	these vendors. DBSC is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC







	requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for these vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed no procedures with respect to DBSCs determination of its
	eligibility to use Interpretation 17.06.




	In our opinion, managements assertion that DBSC complied with the aforementioned applicable
	servicing criteria as of and for the year ended November 30, 2012 for the Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

	not required to be registered where the related asset-backed securities were outstanding during the Reporting Period as of and for the year ended November 30, 2012. The Company has determined that the remainder of the servicing criteria is not
	applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform as of and for the year ended November 30, 2012. Management is responsible for the Companys compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an

	Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the
	Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the Platform and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing selected asset-backed transactions and

	Accordingly, our testing may not have included servicing activities related to each asset-backed transaction or security constituting the Platform. Further, our examination was not designed to detect material noncompliance that may have occurred

	activities performed by them with respect to the servicing platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for the Companys compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
	assertion about the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria based on our examination.




	Our examination was conducted in
	accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence
	about the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing of less than all of the individual asset backed
	transactions and securities that comprise the platform, testing of less than all of the servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those selected activities
	in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to
	determine whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions or any
	other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Companys compliance with the servicing criteria.




	In our opinion, managements assertion that the Company complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of November 30, 2012, and for
	the period from December 1, 2011 through November 30, 2012, for the Corporate Trust Asset Backed Securities Platform is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Announcement: Moody's: No ratings impact on Discover card ABS following Class B(2017-1) and Class C(2017-1) issuance






                    Global Credit Research - 31 May 2017
                









New York, May 31, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service announced today that the issuance of the Discover 
Card Execution Note Trust, Class B(2017-1) Notes and Class 
C(2017-1) Notes on 31 May 2017 would not, in and of itself 
and as of this time, result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the 
ratings assigned to any class of outstanding securities issued by the 
trust.




The issuance of the Class B(2017-1) Notes and Class C(2017-1) 
Notes will increase the investor's share of the collateral pool of credit 
card receivables by the proportional amount of the new issuances and will 
correspondingly decrease the seller's share of the pool by the same proportion. 
Both the Class B(2017-1) Notes and Class C(2017-1) Notes 
and the outstanding securities share a pro rata undivided interest in 
the same collateral pool of credit card receivables and have similar terms. 
Moody's has therefore determined that the new issuances, in 
and of themselves and at this time, will not result in the downgrade 
or withdrawal of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding 
securities issued by the trust.




Moody's opinion addresses only the credit impact associated with the issuance 
of the Class B(2017-1) Notes and Class C(2017-1) Notes, 
and Moody's is not expressing any opinion as to whether the issuances 
have, or could have, other non-credit related effects 
that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of noteholders and/or 
counterparties.






This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.

MOODY’S DEFINES CREDIT RISK AS THE RISK THAT AN ENTITY MAY NOT MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL, FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE AND ANY ESTIMATED FINANCIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. CREDIT RATINGS DO NOT ADDRESS ANY OTHER RISK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET VALUE RISK, OR PRICE VOLATILITY. CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S OPINIONS INCLUDED IN MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT STATEMENTS OF CURRENT OR HISTORICAL FACT.

CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS DO NOT CONSTITUTE OR PROVIDE INVESTMENT OR FINANCIAL ADVICE, AND CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT AND DO NOT PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PURCHASE, SELL, OR HOLD PARTICULAR SECURITIES. NEITHER CREDIT RATINGS NOR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS COMMENT ON THE SUITABILITY OF AN INVESTMENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR. MOODY’S ISSUES ITS CREDIT RATINGS AND PUBLISHES MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WITH THE EXPECTATION AND UNDERSTANDING THAT EACH INVESTOR WILL, WITH DUE CARE, MAKE ITS OWN STUDY AND EVALUATION OF EACH SECURITY THAT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR PURCHASE, HOLDING, OR SALE. MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS AND MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE BY RETAIL INVESTORS AND IT WOULD BE RECKLESS AND INAPPROPRIATE FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO USE MOODY’S CREDIT RATINGS OR MOODY’S PUBLICATIONS WHEN MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION. IF IN DOUBT YOU SHOULD CONTACT YOUR FINANCIAL OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL ADVISER. ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS PROTECTED BY LAW, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COPYRIGHT LAW, AND NONE OF SUCH INFORMATION MAY BE COPIED OR OTHERWISE REPRODUCED, REPACKAGED, FURTHER TRANSMITTED, TRANSFERRED, DISSEMINATED, REDISTRIBUTED OR RESOLD, OR STORED FOR SUBSEQUENT USE FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IN ANY FORM OR MANNER OR BY ANY MEANS WHATSOEVER, BY ANY PERSON WITHOUT MOODY’S PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT. All information contained herein is obtained by MOODY’S from sources believed by it to be accurate and reliable. Because of the possibility of human or mechanical error as well as other factors, however, all information contained herein is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind. MOODY'S adopts all necessary measures so that the information it uses in assigning a credit rating is of sufficient quality and from sources MOODY'S considers to be reliable including, when appropriate, independent third-party sources. However, MOODY’S is not an auditor and cannot in every instance independently verify or validate information received in the rating process or in preparing the Moody’s publications. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability to any person or entity for any indirect, special, consequential, or incidental losses or damages whatsoever arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information, even if MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers is advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages, including but not limited to: (a) any loss of present or prospective profits or (b) any loss or damage arising where the relevant financial instrument is not the subject of a particular credit rating assigned by MOODY’S. To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

$400 million of securities rated


New York, April 25, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned a definitive Aaa (sf) rating to 
the DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-4) Notes issued by the Discover 
Card Execution Note Trust (the trust), sponsored by Discover Bank 
(Discover). Moody's also announced today that the issuance of the 
Discover Card Execution Note Trust, DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-4) 
Notes on 25 April 2017 would not, in and of itself and as of this 
time, result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned 
to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust.




Moody's rating action is as follows:




Issuer: Discover Card Execution Note Trust, DiscoverSeries 
Notes




$400,000,000 DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-4) 
Notes, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)




RATING RATIONALE




The rating is based on the quality of the underlying credit card receivables, 
the expertise of Discover as servicer, the transaction's legal and 
structural protections including early amortization trigger events, 
the credit enhancement provided by subordinate notes, and the likelihood 
of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio. 
Moody's assesses this likelihood from the sponsor's counterparty risk 
assessment (CR Assessment).




The DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-4) Notes will have a fixed rate 
coupon of 2.53% per year, an expected maturity date 
of 15 April 2024, and a legal maturity date of 15 October 2026. 
Moody's rating addresses the likelihood of interest payments being made 
when due and the return of principal by the legal maturity date.




The assets of the trust consist of the Series 2007-CC collateral 
certificate, issued by the Discover Card Master Trust I (the master 
trust), which represents an undivided interest in the master trust's 
credit card receivables originated, and serviced, by Discover. 
Discover's long-term deposit rating is A3 stable/long-term 
senior unsecured Baa3 stable, long-term CR Assessment Baa2(cr), 
short-term deposits P-2, and BCA baa3.




Summary of Analytical Outputs




Moody's Aaa LGSD and Aaa CE are 30.7% and 19.1% 
respectively for this transaction. The Aaa LGSD reflects Moody's 
expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default and 
portfolio shutdown. The Aaa CE reflects the level of credit enhancement 
consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating by haircutting the Aaa LGSD based on 
the rating of the sponsor.


Moody's expects performance in the range of 2.5% - 
3.0% for charge-offs, 18.0% - 
21.0% for yield and 20.0% - 23.0% 
for the principal payment rate.




Moody's performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's 
forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the 
medium term. From time to time, Moody's may, if warranted, 
change these expectations. Performance that falls outside the given 
range may indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or 
weaker than Moody's had anticipated when the related securities were rated. 
Even so, a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily 
result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude 
such actions. The decision to take (or not take) a rating action 
is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including, but 
not exclusively, the performance metrics.




Methodology Underlying the Rating Action:




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating Credit Card Receivables-Backed Securities" published in 
June 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




On 22 March 2017, Moody's released a Request for Comment, 
in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its 
Approach to Rating Credit Card Receivables-Backed Securities. 
Also on 22 March 2017, Moody's released another Request for Comment, 
in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its 
Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance. 
If the revised Methodologies are both implemented as proposed, the 
Credit Rating on the Class A(2017-4) Notes is not expected to be 
affected. Please refer to Moody's Requests for Comment, titled 
"Moody's Proposes Limited Changes to Its Approach to Rating Credit Card 
Receivables-Backed Securities" and "Moody's Proposes Revisions 
to Its Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance," 
for further details regarding the implications of the proposed Methodology 
revisions on certain Credit Ratings. 




Factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating:




Moody's could downgrade the rating of the Class A(2017-4) Notes 
if our expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default 
and portfolio shutdown (i.e., Aaa LGSD) deteriorates 
materially, specifically, if the charge-off rate rises 
or the payment rate or yield falls. An increase in Moody's assessment 
of the likelihood of the sponsor shutting down its credit card portfolio, 
generally reflected from a downgrade in the sponsor's CR Assessment, 
could also lead to a downgrade to the rating of the Class A(2017-4) 
Notes. 




Loss and Cash Flow Analysis: 




In rating this transaction, Moody's uses a cash flow model to determine 
the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario. As a second 
step, Moody's haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsor's 
credit quality. Finally, Moody's compares note available 
credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses, taking into 
account loss allocation and other structural features, to derive 
the expected loss for each rated instrument. 




Stress Scenarios: 




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that 
stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account 
the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 





RATINGS OF EXISTING NOTES UNAFFECTED


Moody's also announced today that the issuance of the Discover Card Execution 
Note Trust Class A(2017-4) Notes on 25 April 2017 would not, 
in and of itself and as of this time, result in the downgrade or 
withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of outstanding securities 
issued by the trust.




The issuance of the Class A(2017-4) Notes will increase the investor's 
share of the collateral pool of credit card receivables by the proportional 
amount of the new issuance and will correspondingly decrease the seller's 
share of the pool by the same proportion. Both the Class A(2017-4) 
Notes and the outstanding securities share a pro rata undivided interest 
in the same collateral pool of credit card receivables, and have 
similar terms. Moody's has therefore determined that the issuance, 
in and of itself and at this time, will not result in the downgrade 
or withdrawal of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding 
securities issued by the trust.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

$350 million of securities rated


New York, April 25, 2017 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned a definitive Aaa (sf) rating to 
the DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-3) Notes issued by the Discover 
Card Execution Note Trust (the trust), sponsored by Discover Bank 
(Discover). Moody's also announced today that the issuance of the 
Discover Card Execution Note Trust, DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-3) 
Notes on 25 April 2017 would not, in and of itself and as of this 
time, result in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned 
to any class of outstanding securities issued by the trust.




Moody's rating action is as follows:




Issuer: Discover Card Execution Note Trust, DiscoverSeries 
Notes




$350,000,000 DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-3) 
Notes, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)




RATING RATIONALE




The rating is based on the quality of the underlying credit card receivables, 
the expertise of Discover as servicer, the transaction's legal and 
structural protections including early amortization trigger events, 
the credit enhancement provided by subordinate notes, and the likelihood 
of the sponsor becoming insolvent and shutting down its credit card portfolio. 
Moody's assesses this likelihood from the sponsor's counterparty risk 
assessment (CR Assessment).




The DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-3) Notes will have a floating rate 
coupon of one-month LIBOR plus 0.23%, an expected 
maturity date of 15 April 2020, and a legal maturity date of 17 
October 2022. Moody's rating addresses the likelihood of interest 
payments being made when due and the return of principal by the legal 
maturity date.




The assets of the trust consist of the Series 2007-CC collateral 
certificate, issued by the Discover Card Master Trust I (the master 
trust), which represents an undivided interest in the master trust's 
credit card receivables originated, and serviced, by Discover. 
Discover's long-term deposit rating is A3 stable/long-term 
senior unsecured Baa3 stable, long-term CR Assessment Baa2(cr), 
short-term deposits P-2, and BCA baa3.




Summary of Analytical Outputs




Moody's Aaa LGSD and Aaa CE are 30.7% and 19.1% 
respectively for this transaction. The Aaa LGSD reflects Moody's 
expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default and 
portfolio shutdown. The Aaa CE reflects the level of credit enhancement 
consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating by haircutting the Aaa LGSD based on 
the rating of the sponsor.


Moody's expects performance in the range of 2.5% - 
3.0% for charge-offs, 18.0% - 
21.0% for yield and 20.0% - 23.0% 
for the principal payment rate.




Moody's performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's 
forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the 
medium term. From time to time, Moody's may, if warranted, 
change these expectations. Performance that falls outside the given 
range may indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or 
weaker than Moody's had anticipated when the related securities were rated. 
Even so, a deviation from the expected range will not necessarily 
result in a rating action nor does performance within expectations preclude 
such actions. The decision to take (or not take) a rating action 
is dependent on an assessment of a range of factors including, but 
not exclusively, the performance metrics.


Methodology Underlying the Rating Action:




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Moody's Approach to 
Rating Credit Card Receivables-Backed Securities" published in 
June 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology. 




On 22 March 2017, Moody's released a Request for Comment, 
in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its 
Approach to Rating Credit Card Receivables-Backed Securities. 
Also on 22 March 2017, Moody's released another Request for Comment, 
in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its 
Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance. 
If the revised Methodologies are both implemented as proposed, the 
Credit Rating on the Class A(2017-3) Notes is not expected to be 
affected. Please refer to Moody's Requests for Comment, titled 
"Moody's Proposes Limited Changes to Its Approach to Rating Credit Card 
Receivables-Backed Securities" and "Moody's Proposes Revisions 
to Its Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance," 
for further details regarding the implications of the proposed Methodology 
revisions on certain Credit Ratings. 




Factors that would lead to a downgrade of the rating:




Moody's could downgrade the rating of the Class A(2017-3) Notes 
if our expectation of the trust's performance following a sponsor default 
and portfolio shutdown (i.e., Aaa LGSD) deteriorates 
materially, specifically, if the charge-off rate rises 
or the payment rate or yield falls. An increase in Moody's assessment 
of the likelihood of the sponsor shutting down its credit card portfolio, 
generally reflected from a downgrade in the sponsor's CR Assessment, 
could also lead to a downgrade to the rating of the Class A(2017-3) 
Notes. 




Loss and Cash Flow Analysis:




In rating this transaction, Moody's uses a cash flow model to determine 
the collateral losses in a maximum stress scenario. As a second 
step, Moody's haircuts such collateral losses based on the sponsor's 
credit quality. Finally, Moody's compares note available 
credit enhancement with the adjusted collateral losses, taking into 
account loss allocation and other structural features, to derive 
the expected loss for each rated instrument. 




Stress Scenarios:




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that 
stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account 
the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 





RATINGS OF EXISTING NOTES UNAFFECTED




Moody's also announced today that the issuance of the Discover Card Execution 
Note Trust, DiscoverSeries Class A(2017-3) Notes on 25 April 
2017 would not, in and of itself and as of this time, result 
in the downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to any class of 
outstanding securities issued by the trust.




The issuance of the Class A(2017-3) Notes will increase the investor's 
share of the collateral pool of credit card receivables by the proportional 
amount of the new issuance and will correspondingly decrease the seller's 
share of the pool by the same proportion. Both the Class A(2017-3) 
Notes and the outstanding securities share a pro rata undivided interest 
in the same collateral pool of credit card receivables and have similar 
terms. Moody's has therefore determined that the issuance, 
in and of itself and at this time, will not result in the downgrade 
or withdrawal of the ratings currently assigned to any class of outstanding 
securities issued by the trust.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.

disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
