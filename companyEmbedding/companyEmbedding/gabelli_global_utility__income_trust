The Gabelli Global Utility & Income Trust
			Important Notice Regarding Change in Investment Policy








 



Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing.  You can obtain more information about the Fund by calling 1-800-GABELLI (1-800-422-3554). The Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund’s portfolio securities. Stocks are subject to market, economic, and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate. Investors acquire shares of the Fund on a securities exchange at market value, which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand.  Industry Concentration Risks. The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in foreign and domestic companies in the Utility Industry and, as a result, the value of the Fund’s shares will be more susceptible to the factors affecting those particular types of companies, including government regulation, inflation cost increases in fuel and other operating expenses, technological innovations that may render existing products and equipment obsolete, and increasing interest rates resulting in high interest costs on borrowings needed for capital construction programs, including costs associated with compliance with environmental and other regulations. As a consequence of its concentration policy, the Fund’s investments may be subject to greater risk and market fluctuation than a fund that has securities representing a broader range of alternatives.  Foreign Securities Risk. There is no limitation on the amount of foreign securities in which the Fund may invest. Investing in securities of foreign companies (or foreign governments), which are generally denominated in foreign currencies, may involve certain risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in domestic companies and could cause the Fund to be affected favorably or unfavorably by changes in currency exchange rates and revaluation of currencies.  Leverage Risk. The use of leverage, which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater than the amount of equity invested, through the issuance of preferred shares, magnifies both the favorable and unfavorable effects of price movements in the investments made by the Fund. The Fund’s use of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss.

                                    Small companies the world over have big potential. They tend to outperform their
                                    larger counterparts over long periods. Their ability to adapt and innovate helps
                                    them create the products, services and business methods we may come to rely on in
                                    the future. And though many investors may not realize it, global small-cap companies
                                    can offer big dividends that make them highly desirable to investors seeking income
                                    and higher return potential.
                                    
                                        The WisdomTree Global SmallCap Dividend Fund (GSD) can enable investors to capitalize
                                        on the big dividends of small companies all over the world.

                                                        before you invest. There are risks involved with investing, including the possible
                                                        loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 


                                                    There are risks involved with investing, including the possible loss of principal.
                                                    Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation
                                                    or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier
                                                    markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed
                                                    markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental
                                                    regulation and intervention or political developments. Funds focusing their investments
                                                    on certain sectors increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory
                                                    development. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of,
                                                    its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to
                                                    outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. A Fund that
                                                    has exposure to one or more sectors may be more vulnerable to any single economic
                                                    or regulatory development. Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details
                                                    regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
