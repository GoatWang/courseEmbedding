Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 298 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks to generate current income consistent with preservation of capital.




Strategy



The fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in fixed-income securities. It invests significantly in fixed-income securities of non-U.S. companies. The fund normally invests in the fixed-income securities of companies located in at least three countries. It may invest in a broad range of fixed-income securities in both developed and emerging markets. The fund may invest across all fixed-income sectors, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and corporate debt securities.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. The fund may invest in lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because Morningstar has rated its risk below the 20th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. The fund may invest in lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. Fixed Income StyleMap® StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's fixed income holdings over two dimensions: credit quality and interest rate sensitivity.  Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's holdings, are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Accent Equity sells Hööks, the Nordic retailing company, to Alipes
19/03/2014 · Sweden · Retail ·  Accent Equity 

The Nordic retailing company Hööks is getting new owners. The investment fund Accent Equity 2008 has agreed to divest all of the funds share capital to Alipes Invest AB. Hööks CEO, Joachim Höök, will remain in his present position and will also, together with company management, remain as a substantial minority owner alongside the new owner. The transaction is conditional upon approval from relevant competition authorities.
Hööks is the leading retailer in equestrian sports in the Nordic countries. Net sales in 2013 amounted to SEK 365 million (EUR 41m) and the company is growing very fast. The company is currently opening stores numbers 44 and 45 and Hööks is thereafter represented at 33 locations in Sweden, 6 in Norway, 4 in Finland and 2 in Denmark.
Hööks has, during the funds ownership period, developed very favourably, says Niklas Sloutski, CEO of Accent Equity Partners AB, advisor to Accent Equity 2008. Net sales have grown by 15 per cent per year and the companys profits have doubled. It is very satisfying to hand over the baton to Alipes, that have the resources, ambition and competency to support Hööks further expansion.
Gunnar Selving, Alipes: Hööks has through its long history and corporate culture established itself as a leading specialist retailer with a strong brand and a unique customer offering.
Mikael Jast, Alipes: We are thrilled to have the possibility to continue developing Hööks together with its management. We foresee continued growth in a stable and interesting marketplace within and outside of the Nordic region.
Hööks story dates as far back as 1931, when Joachim Hööks grandfather established a small saddler in the city of Eksjö in Småland, Sweden. The first mail order catalogue was distributed in 1976 and Hööks website was launched in 1999 in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark. In addition to ordering articles and catalogues, Hööks customers can also obtain information and advice on horses and horse equipment.
The website is today one of the most visited sites within the equestrian trade in the Nordics. Joachim Höök is a third-generation leader of the family inspired company.
I would like to express my gratitude to Accent for their great contribution to our positive development in the past few years, comments Joachim Höök. At the same time, I am welcoming Alipes as new principal owner of Hööks to take part in elevating Hööks to a new level. Alipes thorough knowledge of retail and
e-commerce will ensure continued positive development of the company.

 Please confirm that you have read, understood and accept the Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy and the Important Information given below.
        
This website contains information on a large number of investment funds which are registered and managed in different jurisdictions. Access to the information contained on this website may be restricted by laws and regulations applicable to you as a user. Truthfully stating your domicile is a mandatory requirement for using this website.
        
This information is not intended for you if you are bound by laws or regulations which prohibit the publication of or access to the information in question by virtue of your nationality, your place of residence or on other grounds. If you are subject to such restrictions, you are not permitted to access this information.
        
An investment in the funds described on this website should be made only after careful study of the most recent sales prospectus and the basic legal information, risks, tax aspects and any offering restrictions and other conditions contained therein. Sales prospectuses, key investor information document (KIID), where available, and annual and semiannual reports may be obtained free of charge from the Credit Suisse branch responsible.
        
According to the UCITS Directive 2009/65/EC, investors shall be provided with a key investor information document (KIID) before subscription to a UCITS fund. KIID is provided on the website of the respective investment company or management company or, where available, on this Fund Lab website, "Documents". You herewith specifically consent to the provision of KIID in that form.
        
Every investment involves risk, especially with regard to fluctuations in value and return, up to a total loss of the amount invested. Historical returns and financial market scenarios are no guarantee of current or future performance. Information on investment fund returns may be stated in a currency other than that of your domicile; accordingly exchange-rate fluctuations should be taken into account.
        
Transactions in investment products are subject to tax laws and provisions under various legal jurisdictions: e.g. in the legal jurisdiction in which the investment products are issued or in which the issuer is domiciled; in the legal jurisdictions in which the investment products have invested; in the legal jurisdictions in which these investment products are held in the safekeeping accounts of investors; in the legal jurisdiction in which the investors are domiciled or resident or are subject to tax obligations.        Potential investors are personally responsible for informing themselves about the applicable tax laws and provisions and for complying with them in connection with the subscription, purchase, holding, sale, redemption or distribution of investments. Statements about transactions in investment products may not be construed as tax advice on the part of Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries. It is recommended that investors carefully consider the potential tax consequences of such investments, as needed with the assistance of a tax advisor, and compare them with the tax consequences of investing in other products. It is also important to note that investors must still themselves compile and/or supplement the data for the calculation of taxes even where such data has been automatically prepared on the part of Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries. 
        
Units of investment funds of Credit Suisse Group AG's three fund platforms (Switzerland and Liechtenstein) and CS funds that are managed in Germany by SGSS Deutschland Kapitalanlagegesellschaft mbH may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States or any of its territories. Units of these investment funds may not be offered, sold or delivered to US citizens or persons resident or incorporated in the US and/or other natural or legal persons whose income and/or returns, regardless of origin, are subject to US income tax, as well as persons who are considered to be US persons pursuant to Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and/or the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act, in each case as amended from time to time.
The information on investment funds provided on this website does not represent an offer or a recommendation to enter into a transaction of any kind.
Credit Suisse Group AG and/or its affiliates and subsidiaries may receive from third parties as part of their compensation or otherwise, one-time or recurring remunerations (e.g. issue commissions, trailer fees).

Strategy and process

Capital preservation: The fund invests in highly rated money market instruments to maintain a stable net asset value and protect investors' wealth.
Attractive income: The portfolio managers use credit research to select a diverse portfolio of securities that offer above-average yields.
Leading research: The managers, supported by Putnam's fixed-income research division, manage risk by analyzing individual securities and overall market conditions.



 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Class A, M, R, and T1 shares have no initial sales charge. Class B shares reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declines to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter. Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC for the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for B, C, M, R, and T1 shares before their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and higher operating expenses for such shares. Class A, M, R, and T1 shares generally have no CDSC. Please see the fund's prospectus for more details. Yield more closely reflects current performance than total return.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Class A, M, R, and T1 shares have no initial sales charge. Class B shares reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declines to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter. Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC for the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for B, C, M, R, and T1 shares before their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and higher operating expenses for such shares. Class A, M, R, and T1 shares generally have no CDSC. Please see the fund's prospectus for more details. Yield more closely reflects current performance than total return.

A multi-faceted view of the portfolio

Below you can find continuously updated views of the portfolio's daily and weekly liquid asset levels, its net asset value
(NAV), and asset flows into and out of the portfolio. Together, these graphs provide insights on the portfolio's resilience
during periods of heightened risk in the money market, and are the focus of government policies designed to maintain market stability.




Daily and weekly liquid assets as of 

This graph displays the percentage of the fund's total assets invested in daily and weekly liquid assets as of the end of each business day during the preceding six months. The fund is required to invest at least 10% of its total assets in daily liquid assets and at least 30% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets. Daily liquid assets include cash, direct obligations of the U.S. government, securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day, and receivables scheduled to be paid within one business day. Weekly liquid assets include daily liquid assets, government agency discount notes with remaining maturities of 60 days or less, securities that will mature or are subject to a
demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days, and receivables scheduled to be paid within five business days.






Fluctuating net asset value as of 

This graph displays the fund's daily net asset value (NAV) per share during the preceding six months as if it were calculated using the market value of the fund's portfolio as of the end of each business day during that period.


The market-value or "shadow" net asset value per share shown below for a given day may differ from the official NAV used for transactions in fund shares. The official NAV is shown on the "Highlights" tab. The shadow net asset value per share shown below does not reflect the application of the amortized cost method of valuing fund portfolio holdings, which normally allows the fund to maintain an official NAV of $1.00 per share. When a shareholder buys or redeems fund shares, the official NAV would be used as the net asset value per share.






Daily net asset flows as of 
This graph displays the dollar amount of net shareholder inflows or outflows of the fund as of the end of each business day during the preceding six months.




In accordance with recent rule changes by the SEC, Putnam Money Market Fund intends to operate as a "retail money market fund" as defined by Rule 2a-7. As a result, the fund will only be available to natural persons and, effective on or about October 10, 2016, will be subject to liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances. For more information, see the fund's latest prospectus.
You could lose money by investing in the fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.




Yield more closely reflects current performance than total return.  Consider these risks before investing: You can lose money by investing in the fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. The fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's liquidity falls below certain required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time. The values of money market investments usually rise and fall in response to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk is generally lowest for investments with short maturities (a significant part of the fund's investments). Although the fund only buys high quality investments, investments backed by a letter of credit have the risk that the provider of the letter of credit will not be able to fulfill its obligations to the issuer. The effects of inflation may erode the value of your investment over time.
