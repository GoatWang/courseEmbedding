Global High Yield Bonds

As a natural extension of our U.S. and European High Yield Bond strategies, Oaktree's Global High Yield Bond strategy targets the most attractive risk/return opportunities we identify across the developed world. The strategy seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by investing in the lower-rated yet creditworthy performing bonds of North American and European corporations. Our Global High Yield Bond portfolios are co-managed by Sheldon Stone and David Rosenberg, Oaktree's U.S. High Yield Bond co-portfolio managers, and James Turner,  Oaktree’s European High Yield Bond portfolio manager, and benefit from a highly experienced research team.

"Our investment philosophy centers around employing a highly disciplined, credit-intensive research approach to construct a diversified, risk-controlled portfolio," says Mr. Stone. "We believe the avoidance of defaults is the most reliable source of superior performance."

Allocations between North America and Europe are based on an issue-by-issue relative value framework and market technicals. We do not select investments based on anticipated interest rate movements and resulting price fluctuations since we view these events as beyond our ability to predict with sufficient accuracy. In constructing our portfolios, we avoid concentrations by industry or company because, as we see it, thoughtful diversification is one of the most cost-effective means of mitigating the impact of credit problems.

Home/ About



About

Oaktree's mission is to deliver superior investment results with risk under control and to conduct our business with the highest integrity.

Oaktree Capital Management is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in credit strategies. The firm was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s in high yield bonds, convertible securities, distressed debt, real estate, control investments and listed equities. Today, Oaktree comprises over 900 employees in Los Angeles (headquarters), New York, Stamford, Houston, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam*, Dublin*, Luxembourg*, Dubai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai and Sydney. We have 30 portfolio managers with average experience of 23 years and over 700 years of combined investment experience.

The firm’s competitive advantages include its experienced team of investment professionals, a global platform and a unifying investment philosophy. This investment philosophy, which consists of six tenets - risk control, consistency, market inefficiency, specialization, bottom-up analysis and disavowal of market timing - is complemented by a set of core business principles that articulate Oaktree’s commitment to excellence in investing, commonality of interests with clients, a collaborative and cooperative culture, and a disciplined, opportunistic approach to the expansion of offerings.

As a result of consistent application of our philosophy and principles, Oaktree has earned a large and distinguished  clientele. Among Oaktree's global clients are 75 of the 100 largest U.S. pension plans, over 400 corporations around the world, over 350 endowments and foundations globally, 16 sovereign wealth funds and 38 of the 50 primary state retirement plans in the United States.

Our expertise investing across the capital structure has allowed us to cultivate a diversified mix of global investment strategies in six categories: distressed debt, corporate debt, control investing, convertible securities, real estate and listed equities. Importantly, the expansion of our strategies has been achieved primarily through “step-outs” into highly related fields, based on identifying markets that (a) we believe have the potential for attractive returns, and (b) can be exploited in a manner consistent with the firm’s risk-controlled philosophy.
