Home








Permian Investment Partners, LP
Permian Investment Partners, LP (the “Company or Permian”) is currently registered as an investment adviser under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”).
The Company’s investment philosophy is to target absolute returns across market cycles through the implementation of a Western European-focused, value-oriented and event-driven equity long/short strategy. Permian Investment Partners, LP is a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2008 and is controlled by Alex Duran, Scott Hendrickson and Joseph Swain (collectively, the “Principals”). Former partner Cara Goldenberg departed the firm in 2012. 
The Company believes analysis of high-level management change provides insight into the market. When coupled with a second level screen for securities with material intrinsic value dislocations (as measured by the potential free cash flows available to equity holders under best-in-class operational management and implementation of the most efficient capital structure), this analysis yields an original pipeline of ideas. This presents the opportunity for absolute returns over a long-term investment horizon.
Note: This information reflects Permian’s opinion and goals and should not be understood as a prediction or projection of actual investments that will be made or transactions that will be achieved. All investment strategies involve significant risks, including availability of opportunities and execution of ideas and as such may not be achieved.

 Educational Background



 
Class of 2007 


Columbia University

                  Columbia University is one of the world's most important centers of research and at the same time a distinctive and distinguished learning environment for undergraduates and graduate students in many scholarly and professional fields. The University recognizes the importance of its location in New York City and seeks to link its research and teaching to the vast resources of a great metropolis. It seeks to attract a diverse and international faculty and student body, to support research and teaching on global issues, and to create academic relationships with many countries and regions. It expects all areas of the university to advance knowledge and learning at the highest level and to convey the products of its efforts to the world.                




 
Class of 2000 


Emory University

                  Emory University, recognized internationally for its outstanding liberal arts colleges, graduate and professional schools as well as one of the Southeast's leading health care systems, is located on a beautiful, leafy campus in Atlanta, Georgia's historic Druid Hills suburb.

Emory maintains an uncommon balance for an institution of its standing: our scholars and experts generate more than $500 million in research funding annually, while also maintaining a traditional emphasis on teaching.

The university is enriched by the legacy and energy of Atlanta, and by collaboration among its schools, centers and partners.

Brahman Capital Corp.


                  Brahman Capital Corp. serves as the investment manager of various long/short and long-only private investment funds. The firm seeks to construct portfolios in which performance is determined by stock selection rather than overall market direction. Each long/short fund seeks to generate returns through individual stock selection on both its long and short holdings. Brahman's long/short strategy is a fundamental strategy that focuses primarily on disciplined free cash flow value investing with a strong emphasis on the quality of company management. Each fund’s long and short positions primarily consist of equity and/or equity-related securities of US or non-US corporations, partnerships, or other entities that Brahman believes to be undervalued or overvalued, respectively. Each fund’s investments generally include special situations involving the securities and other financial instruments of issuers engaged in extraordinary corporate events, such as CEO changes, spin-offs, takeover attempts, mergers, tender offers, post-bankruptcy reorganizations, liquidations, LBOs, stock repurchase programs, and other forms of corporate restructurings. Brahmin's long-only funds focus primarily on long positions in equity or equity-related securities of US and non-US companies they believe to be undervalued. The funds generally include all of the long positions in the long/short funds other than market hedges.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
