Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016.

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

PITTSFORD, N.Y., June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Karpus Investment Management announced today its opposition to the proposed merger of the Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund (NYSE:    MSP) ("MSP") with and into the Madison Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (NYSE:    MCN) ("MCN" and together with MSP, the "Funds"). On May 24, 2017, the Funds issued a press release announcing that the Board of Trustees of each Fund approved the proposed merger.








"The proposed merger is clearly not a solution that best serves shareholders' interests. It is dilutive to MSP shareholders' ownership and greatly benefits Madison Asset Management by maximizing fee revenues. Shareholders of MSP voted last year to receive full value for their shares but the Board chose to ignore them. Now, the Board is reinstating a proposal that they introduced last year and subsequently cancelled," stated Brett D. Gardner, Senior Corporate Governance Analyst at Karpus Investment Management.
Gardner further stated, "This is precisely why we submitted trustee nominees for both Funds. It is also why we submitted a 14a-8 shareholder proposal to terminate the investment adviser as well as an additional proposal requesting that each Fund's Board promptly consider authorizing a self-tender offer for all outstanding common shares of each Fund at or close to net asset value. Since shareholders approved the non-binding proposal at MSP's 2016 Annual Meeting and MSP's sister fund, MCN, is comprised of three trustees that all serve on MSP's Board, we believe Madison must be terminated and new, independent trustees must be elected to enhance shareholder value. As evidenced by the Funds' recent merger press release, the Boards of MSP and MCN appear more interested in the bottom line of the investment adviser, as opposed to listening to shareholders and maximizing shareholder value."
He concluded, "Because of this, we believe the time has come to elect new trustees, allow shareholders to realize close to full value for their shares, and to terminate Madison Asset Management as the Funds' adviser."
Karpus Investment Management is an independent, registered investment advisory firm founded in 1986. It is based in Pittsford, NY and practices conservative money management with approximately $3 billion in assets under management. It is among the largest shareholders in both MSP and MCN owning over 1.3 million shares of MSP and over 2 million shares of MCN.
