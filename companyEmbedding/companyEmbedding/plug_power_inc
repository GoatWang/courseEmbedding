It takes a special company to create a market for fuel cells where one did not exist.
At Plug Power, we do that every day. 
Plug Power has developed product suites that solve the fundamental issues for our customers, in a cost effective way. 

GenDrive: fuel cell power for material handling applications to displace lead-acid batteries in lift trucks. By using GenDrive, our customers eliminate the disadvantages of dealing with batteries such as progressive battery droop, timely battery changes and costly battery charges. GenDrive customers can see 5% to 6% productivity savings.
GenSure: fuel cell power for stationary power applications as a predictable and reliable solution over traditional generator or battery power technologies. As a highly-flexible solution, GenSure users purchase the backup power they need now and grow as needed.
GenFuel: a full service of fueling solutions for material handling and stationary power customers. GenFuel ensures cost effective hydrogen is always on site, so your operations are never interrupted.
GenCare: comprehensive aftermarket service and support of all Plug Power fuel cell power units and fueling services.

Plug Power products have seen real-time operating conditions for more than 107M hours. One single unit can operate as many hours in a year as a car will in its lifetime.
We build real products, with real value, allowing you to be really productive.

        Why Plug Power Inc Shares Popped as Much as 19% Today

What happened Shares of hydrogen forklift specialist Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ: PLUG) rose as much as 18.9% on Friday after the company announced an expanded agreement with Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT). As of 12:42 p.m. EDT, the stock was up 11.3%. So what
Wal-Mart has agreed to install Plug Power's GenKey fueling station and fuel cell energy solutions in 30 more locations over the next three years, adding to the 10 locations expected to be up and running by the end of this year. The deal is expected to be worth about $80 million for Plug Power. Image source: Getty Images.In addition to the supply agreement, Wal-Mart was given 55,286,696 warrants to buy shares of Plug Power stock. Of those, 5,819,652 will "vest upon execution of the new program agreements" at a price of $2.1231 per share. The rest of the warrants will vest in $50 million purchase increments with prices set to where Plug Power's shares are trading. This follows a deal earlier this year in which Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) agreed to buy $70 million of product and got 55,286,696 warrants as part of the agreement with a $1.1893 exercise price. Now what
Wal-Mart and Amazon are two key customers for Plug Power, and the expansion of hydrogen fuel cells in their warehouses is good news for the company. But these are also customers that clearly have all of the power in this relationship and now hold warrants that will add nearly 50% to the company's shares outstanding if exercised. That obviously takes away from upside investors may get from these agreements. Unless Plug Power can prove it's able to make money selling to customers who aren't Wal-Mart and Amazon, I don't think this will be a great stock for investors. 10 stocks we like better than Plug Power

		Plug Power Inc (PLUG) Stock Soars on Big Walmart Deal	
Walmart will be buying a significant stake of the company

Jul 21, 2017, 11:22 am EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer



 
 

Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares soared as the company inked a new deal with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT).
The company announced an expansion of its partnership with the national retailer that consists of a revised version of its agreement with Walmart regarding its fuel cell capabilities. Plug Power will have access to project financing at a lower cost of capital and no restricted cash.
The move will make the company’s future distribution transactions with Walmart cash flow positive from the beginning. Plug Power will implement its GenKey hydrogen fueling station and fuel cell energy solutions in up to 30 more Walmart sites in North America over the coming three years.
The company has already implemented 22 of these sites since 2014, amounting to a fleet of 5,500 Plug Power fuel cells at Walmart’s distribution centers.
“Our expanding relationship with Walmart validates Plug Power’s advanced capabilities in fuel cell products and systems, allowing the world’s largest retailer to maintain its leading position as an industry innovator,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power.
Marsh added that the move will help the company improve its revenue visibility and cost structure, while also allowing customers to see higher productivity from the company.
As part of the deal, Walmart will buy up to 55,286,696 of Plug Power’s common shares.
PLUG stock grew 9.7% Friday, while WMT shares fell 0.3%.

		Plug Power Inc (PLUG) Stock Soars on Big Walmart Deal	
Walmart will be buying a significant stake of the company

Jul 21, 2017, 11:22 am EDT  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer



 
 

Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG) shares soared as the company inked a new deal with Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT).
The company announced an expansion of its partnership with the national retailer that consists of a revised version of its agreement with Walmart regarding its fuel cell capabilities. Plug Power will have access to project financing at a lower cost of capital and no restricted cash.
The move will make the company’s future distribution transactions with Walmart cash flow positive from the beginning. Plug Power will implement its GenKey hydrogen fueling station and fuel cell energy solutions in up to 30 more Walmart sites in North America over the coming three years.
The company has already implemented 22 of these sites since 2014, amounting to a fleet of 5,500 Plug Power fuel cells at Walmart’s distribution centers.
“Our expanding relationship with Walmart validates Plug Power’s advanced capabilities in fuel cell products and systems, allowing the world’s largest retailer to maintain its leading position as an industry innovator,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power.
Marsh added that the move will help the company improve its revenue visibility and cost structure, while also allowing customers to see higher productivity from the company.
As part of the deal, Walmart will buy up to 55,286,696 of Plug Power’s common shares.
PLUG stock grew 9.7% Friday, while WMT shares fell 0.3%.

Continued growth expected in Walmart’s use of Plug Power hydrogen fuel cells in its  distribution center material handling fleet
 Walmart granted right to purchase Plug Power equity, vesting based on future business LATHAM, N.Y., July  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), a leader in providing energy solutions that change the way the world moves, announces a new collaborative agreement with Walmart to facilitate further expansion of its ongoing relationship with Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT).  The new agreement includes revised deal terms with Walmart that allow Plug Power to access project financing at a lower cost of capital and no restricted cash, making Plug Power’s future distribution transactions with Walmart cash flow positive up front.  Plug Power expects to provide its GenKey hydrogen fueling station and fuel cell energy solutions to up to 30 additional Walmart sites in North America over the next three years, with ten sites already under contract and scheduled to be finished by the end of 2017. The value of these 2017 commitments is expected to be around $80 million. On average, Plug Power has deployed a new Walmart site every 6 weeks since 2014, resulting in a deployed fleet of 5500 Plug Power fuel cells at 22 of Walmart’s U.S. distribution centers as of the end of 2016.      “Our expanding relationship with Walmart validates Plug Power’s advanced capabilities in fuel cell products and systems, allowing the world’s largest retailer to maintain its leading position as an industry innovator,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power. “Walmart’s long-term supply agreement is a great example of our strategy in action, as it enables us to improve both our revenue visibility and cost structure, all while allowing our customers to experience improved productivity and operational cost savings. We see a growing market opportunity for our power and fueling station technologies within the material handling segment, as well as new mobility applications worldwide, positioning us for long-term success and shareholder value creation.” As part of the agreement, and as an incentive to align Walmart’s future business with Plug Power’s growth and success, Plug Power has granted Walmart warrants to acquire up to 55,286,696 of Plug Power's common shares.  Warrants for the first 5,819,652 shares vested upon execution of the new program agreements at an exercise price of $2.1231 per share, which is based on the volume weighted average closing price of Plug Power common shares for the thirty trading days ending July 19, 2017.  Additional warrants will vest in installments tied to successive $50 million payment thresholds, up to a total of $600 million in the aggregate, made by Walmart in connection with qualified purchases of goods and services from Plug Power.  The exercise price for warrants vesting after the first 34,917,912 warrant shares will be based on the volume weighted average closing price at the time that such warrants vest. The details of the warrants and vesting is described in more detail in a report on Form 8-K filed by Plug Power with the SEC earlier today. The new agreement is a key milestone in a longstanding relationship with Walmart, which has been at the forefront of fuel cell technology adoption and commercialization in material handling, becoming Plug Power’s first GenKey customer in 2014. Plug Power supplies the retail giant with fuel cells, hydrogen fueling stations, and ongoing maintenance services. Today, Walmart operates the largest fleet of hydrogen fuel cell powered electric vehicles in the world, totaling more than 6,600 units in distribution centers across North America. Plug Power’s hydrogen fuel cell technology replaces traditional lead-acid batteries, helping customers increase warehouse productivity with a more energy efficient solution, while reducing the costs and sustainability issues related to traditional battery maintenance. “Plug Power’s material handling solutions represent a critical component in our supply chain,” said Jeff Smith, Senior Director of Logistics Maintenance and Purchasing Services. “Plug Power’s hydrogen fuel cell technology, coupled with their innovative fueling stations has proven to be a reliable, cost-effective alternative to traditional energy solutions.” Technology Collaboration  Plug Power has introduced a suite of ProGen fuel cell engine platforms to provide clean, scalable power for on- and off-road applications around the world. In addition to the GenKey contract, Walmart and Plug Power will continue to collaborate on developing, testing, and commercializing new motive power applications that utilize Plug Power’s ProGen line of fuel cell engines and systems. Advancing the electrification of mission-critical devices, is an important piece of Walmart’s future plans.

Plug Power shares jump 13% on news of deal with Wal-Mart
Shares of Plug Power Inc.  soared 13% in premarket trade Friday, after the company announced that it is issuing to Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  warrants to buy 55.3 million of its shares. The deal is part of an existing commercial agreement between the two companies under which Wal-Mart buys Plug Power's fuel-cell powered machines for its distribution centers. Plug Power made the disclosure in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that outlines the vesting schedule for the warrants, which depends on how much Wal-Mart invests in the company's products and services. Plug Power shares have gained 77% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Plug Power is an American company engaged in the design and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cell systems that replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles powered by electricity. The company is headquartered in Latham, New York and has facilities in Spokane, Washington.
Plug Power's GenDrive system integrates fuel cells manufactured by both Plug Power and Ballard Power and incorporates a hydrogen storage system that allows the system to "recharge" in a matter of minutes as opposed to several hours for lead-acid batteries. It allows hydrogen-powered forklifts to run at a constant steady power compared to conventional batteries, which experience "droop" in their output towards the end of a shift. GenDrive units occupy the same space designed for conventional batteries.
History[edit]
Plug Power was founded in 1997 as a joint venture between DTE Energy and Mechanical Technology Inc. The company went public in 2002. Indoor forklifts were their first viable market with customers such as Nike, BMW, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Mercedes-Benz, Kroger, and Whole Foods.
In February 2017, the company announced the first shipments of its ProGen fuel cell engines designed for electric delivery vehicles and the adoption of its GenDrive system by the USPS truck fleet in Capitol Heights, Maryland.[1][2]
In April 2017, Amazon.com purchases over 50 million shares of Plug Power common stock and enters into agreement to use hydrogen technology within its warehouses for fulfillment. [3]

Founded
1997

Plug Power is an American company engaged in the design and manufacturing of hydrogen fuel cell systems that replace conventional batteries in equipment and vehicles powered by electricity. The company is headquartered in Latham, New York and has facilities in Spokane, Washington.
Plug Power's GenDrive system integrates fuel cells manufactured by both Plug Power and Ballard Power and incorporates a hydrogen storage system that allows the system to "recharge" in a matter of minutes as opposed to several hours for lead-acid batteries. It allows hydrogen-powered forklifts to run at a constant steady power compared to conventional batteries, which experience "droop" in their output towards the end of a shift. GenDrive units occupy the same space designed for conventional batteries.
History[edit]
Plug Power was founded in 1997 as a joint venture between DTE Energy and Mechanical Technology Inc. The company went public in 2002. Indoor forklifts were their first viable market with customers such as Nike, BMW, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Mercedes-Benz, Kroger, and Whole Foods.
In February 2017, the company announced the first shipments of its ProGen fuel cell engines designed for electric delivery vehicles and the adoption of its GenDrive system by the USPS truck fleet in Capitol Heights, Maryland.[1][2]
In April 2017, Amazon.com purchases over 50 million shares of Plug Power common stock and enters into agreement to use hydrogen technology within its warehouses for fulfillment. [3]
