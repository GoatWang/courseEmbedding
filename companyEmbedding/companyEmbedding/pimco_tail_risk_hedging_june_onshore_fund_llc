Is Timing Everything? Practical Implementation of Tail Risk Hedging​​



Michael Connor, Markus Aakko


Article Introduction“Just in time” hedging is nearly impossible: By the time an investor decides to hedge, the market may already price in the significant risk of a tail event. Instead, hedges could be included as a permanent part of an asset allocation: what we might call “just in case” hedging. 
An optimal strategy may involve averaging into a hedging allocation. In addition, using a broader set of hedge instruments may help lower the costs. 
We believe that tail risk hedges have a place in any portfolio that has a substantial allocation to risk assets. 
​


Article Main BodyThe natural tendency of most investors is to seek hedging against market volatility when markets become bearish and to eschew any hedging expense when market sentiment seems very bullish. As a result, most investors tend not to hold hedges exactly when they may be most attractive – near market peaks when implied volatility is at its lows. 
At its core, “just in time” hedging is merely speculation. It is akin to purchasing earthquake or flood insurance only during times when you expect a natural disaster is imminent – and similarly to natural events, market conditions are very difficult to forecast. 
For example, based on the VIX index – the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Volatility Index, which measures the implicit cost of hedging – markets were moderately concerned but not expecting a deadlock as the U.S. Congress approached the edge of a “fiscal cliff” at the end of 2012. When it became apparent that there might in fact be a standoff, the VIX rose sharply higher, and then collapsed on the first trading day of the new year after an agreement was reached on 1 Jan 2013 (see Figure 1). Waiting until the last minute to hedge would have proven very costly in this case, as options purchased in the last few days of 2012 collapsed in price in 2013.​ 
 
 
 
Theoretically, if the investment horizon were infinite, hedging might not be necessary. Over long periods of time, an investor may incur positive returns from many sources of risk premium. Even in the case of very long horizons, however, the contingent liquidity that tail risk hedging (TRH) generates in a market crisis affords investors the opportunity to buy assets at distressed prices, and hence may be an attractive addition to an asset allocation. 
 
In practice, though, few investors are able to dismiss investment risk as a “short-term fluctuation.” Reporting to stakeholders usually takes place at least annually, and over the short run there can be considerable volatility. In addition, pension funds and others who are making substantial payouts on a yearly basis will find that making these payouts funded by sales of assets at extremely depressed prices can have a severe impact on future performance. For investors who have a substantial amount of risk assets in their portfolio, TRH can make it easier to maintain or even increase this return-seeking allocation, given the expected reduction in exposure to left-tail risks. 
Is timing everything?The cost of hedging can vary significantly over any given timeframe, and “just in time” hedging is nearly impossible: By the time an investor decides to hedge, the market correction may have already begun, and hedging may have already become expensive. Ideally, then, hedges could be included as a permanent part of an asset allocation and hence would be in place when most needed – what we might call “just in case” hedging. And even in a rising market, TRH can add value, providing a “trailing stop” to the portfolio that may give investors more comfort in maintaining their allocations to risk assets when markets rally.
In fact, some investors may consider a counter-cyclical approach: varying the amount of hedges purchased based on the level of implied volatility. A simple way of accomplishing this is to set a fixed budget and spread purchases over time. If options are expensive, the fixed budget buys less hedging, and if they are cheap, some of the budget can even be held back for a later period as long as the desired hedge ratio is accomplished. And since hedging tends to be cheapest when equity markets are at their peaks, and vice versa, an investor can potentially use this counter-cyclicality to their advantage (see Figures 2 and 3). 
 
 
 
 
 
When considering spreading purchases over time, one practical methodology in today’s steep volatility term structure could be to implement 1-year hedges in a laddered fashion, purchasing ¼ of the targeted notional value each quarter. Each tranche would hedge 25% of the total portfolio for 1-year from the execution date, and with a tail risk hedge level that is set relative to market levels on the execution date. In this way, the hedger will have both time and strike price diversity in the hedge portfolio (see Figure 4).
 
Alternatively, one could purchase full n​otional for a quarter and continue rolling 3-month options. One downside of this shorter-dated option strategy is that it comes with little time value. It may be cheaper, but at the same time, if a significant market event takes place, shorter maturity options are unlikely to provide as much of a hedge as staggered longer maturity options do.
 
The indirect approachTiming is not everything – what you buy and how you structure your hedges is equally important. Volatility is not uniformly priced in every market, and from time to time, investors may be able to purchase cheaper hedges using correlated hedge instruments in other markets.
 
As an example, when markets experience a sharp correction, currency markets may reflect repatriation flows. In that event, currencies with higher yields will tend to sell off and currencies with lower yields will tend to appreciate. (This is often called an unwind of the carry trade.) For instance, note how the correlation of the Australian dollar (AUD) with the S&P 500 becomes stronger when there is a pronounced equity market selloff (see Figure 5). If the out-of-the-money (OTM) options markets price to the average correlation (50%) instead of the tail correlation (60%), then the price of the OTM AUD put may be as much as 30% cheap to the S&P 500 put – a significant savings.
 
 
 
Because the choice of hedge instrument will change depending on market conditions, these proxy hedges can be actively managed. For example, if a currency proxy hedge suddenly becomes more valuable relative to the direct hedge, it may make sense to take profits on that indirect hedge, and rotate to other hedges or even direct equity puts.
 
Note that the use of indirect hedges does not come without some additional risk. Because proxy hedges may fail to perform in line with direct hedges, and therefore result in poor hedging against the specified risks, they should be used in moderation and in conjunction with direct hedges. The idiosyncratic risk associated with each proxy hedge can also be moderated through portfolio diversification – in other words, purchasing a portfolio of different proxy hedges in order to reduce exposure to any one specific indirect hedge. Along with this, proper management of a TRH portfolio requires a robust set of tools to quantify and limit this basis risk. 
Funding the hedgesIn most portfolios, we find that financing a hedging program can be accomplished entirely through raising funds from existing investments and using the proceeds to purchase options. However, some investors may consider these outlays too large for comfort.
 
Options markets can help – investors can choose to sell some options to finance purchase of the hedges. We are not advocating the use of collar strategies, as these can be very costly – for example, an investor hedging an equity portfolio using collars from 2009 to 2013 would have paid on average over 8% of the hedge amount in losses on the sold option as the markets rallied and the volatility curve “rolled up” (see Figure 6).
 
 
Therefore, we believe that sold option positions should be complementary to the overall investment strategy. For example, for a pension fund with a long-duration liability and an objective of obtaining more duration as yields rise, swaptions could allow the pension plan to “pre-commit” to extending duration at higher yields by selling payer swaptions above current yield levels. Proceeds of these swaption sales could then be used to finance purchases of equity puts and indirect proxy hedges. In this case, the investor is taking advantage of the natural positioning in the portfolio to reduce the hedging cost.Figure 7 offers a numerical example of this approach: A plan aiming to hedge $100 million of equity exposure could sell $100 million of payer swaptions 100 basis points above the current market yield.

 
 
Very careful strategy planning is required for these combined approaches, and stress testing and scenario analysis in relation to collateral needs may be important.
 
Hedging strategies: key takeaways for investorsTiming of hedging decisions matters – purchasing hedges at their most expensive reduces the efficacy of hedging, since the market already prices in significant risk of a tail event. At PIMCO, we believe that tail risk hedges have a place in any portfolio that has a substantial allocation to risk assets. However, timing the entry point for a hedging program is unlikely to be possible, and so the optimal strategy may involve averaging into a hedging allocation, beginning at a time when equity prices are high and the cost of hedging is low, as appears to be the case now, given current S&P 500 and VIX levels.
In addition, using a broader set of hedge instruments may help lower the costs. When combined with a disciplined approach to cost averaging and potential sale of some options to finance the overall hedging program, it may be possible to mitigate a large part of the cost of the overall hedging program.

Article DisclaimerAdditional Information 
Tail risk hedging program: An actively managed portfolio of option positions (an investment hedge portfolio) designed to mitigate losses stemming from portfolio investment risks in a reference investment portfolio over an investment hedge horizon, with a specific attachment point and a specified expense level. 
Portfolio investment risks: Dominant portfolio investment risks are quantified as investment risk factors which can include broad equity, foreign exchange, interest rate duration, and credit spread. During periods of volatility, policy and liquidity factors can be important. 
Investment hedge horizon: Typically six months to five years, usually one year. 
Attachment point: The targeted maximum loss at the investment hedge horizon of the combined reference investment portfolio and the investment hedge portfolio. Not a guaranteed number, the loss threshold should be considered an investment objective. 
Expense (cost) level: The cost of a tail risk hedging program is a periodic expense, expressed as a percentage of the reference investment portfolio, for example, 1.2% per annum. Expense levels are determined at the outset of the tail risk hedging program but can vary over time either because market conditions change or because the client chooses to alter the hedge horizon or the attachment point. 
Direct and indirect hedges: Direct hedges are options contracts whose values are driven by investment risk factors that are explicit risks in the reference investment portfolio. Indirect hedges are options contracts whose values are driven by investment risk factors that are not explicit risks in the investment portfolio or whose size is larger than necessary to directly hedge an explicit risk. 
Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign-denominated and/or -domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets.Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. High yield, lower-rated securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Tail risk hedging may involve entering into financial derivatives that are expected to increase in value during the occurrence of tail events. Investing in a tail event instrument could lose all or a portion of its value even in a period of severe market stress. A tail event is unpredictable; therefore, investments in instruments tied to the occurrence of a tail event are speculative. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against market loss. Investors should consult their investment professional prior to making an investment decision. 
The correlation of various indexes or securities against one another or against inflation is based upon data over a certain time period. These correlations may vary substantially in the future or over different time periods that can result in greater volatility. There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are suitable for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest long-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. References to specific securities and their issuers are not intended and should not be interpreted as recommendations to purchase, sell or hold such securities. PIMCO products and strategies may or may not include the securities referenced and, if such securities are included, no representation is being made that such securities will continue to be included. Hypothetical and simulated examples have many inherent limitations and are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. There are frequently sharp differences between simulated results and the actual results. There are numerous factors related to the markets in general or the implementation of any specific investment strategy, which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of simulated results and all of which can adversely affect actual results. No guarantee is being made that the stated results will be achieved.

Understanding Derivative Overlays, in All Their Forms



Markus Aakko, Rene Martel


Article Introduction​Passively managed overlays are typically based on a simple formula, while active approaches involve more complex algorithms or decision-making.
Overlay examples include portable alpha, LDI, currency, completion, rebalancing, and tactical asset allocation overlays -- as well as tail-risk hedging and hedge fund replication.
Potential benefits include the ability to effectively manage cash, reduce costs and risk exposure, simplify manager transitions and express tactical views.


Article Main BodyDerivative overlays have become a mainstay of modern pension fund management. Many plans use overlay strategies in order to achieve a variety of asset allocation objectives, ranging from passive currency hedging to implementation of tactical shifts or even complex hedge fund replication strategies. 
The proliferation of these overlay strategies has created substantial confusion in terminology, as a multitude of approaches are offered under this term. 
Complicating the matter even further, there are many practical considerations that pension plans need to consider once they identify the appropriate overlay strategy. For example, the potential for leverage exists whenever an overlay strategy is implemented, whether the program is outsourced or run in-house. When an overlay strategy is outsourced, the potential for leverage usually means that the plan sponsor and overlay manager interact and communicate much more frequently than they do in other asset management relationships. Not to do so would invite additional risk to plan assets and funded status. 
Taxonomy of overlays Overlay strategies come in a variety of forms. Some are managed passively, with formulaic objectives that can be executed inexpensively. Other strategies involve complex algorithms or sometimes even active decision-making. In trying to identify the types of overlay strategies that exist, we have included most strategies currently marketed under the name “overlay.” While overlay strategies have many divergent features, the common element among them is that they typically involve a synthetic replication of an asset class, market or factor exposure. In many cases, the exposure obtained may be greater than the actual funded amount of the mandate. This implicit financing and leverage is typically obtained either through the use of derivative instruments or forward-settling purchases. 
One way overlay strategies can be broadly categorized is by the time horizon associated with changes in positioning. Some overlays transact frequently in order to adjust to market conditions while others are established as more of a strategic position. The most common strategies are shown in Figure 1. 

Portable alpha overlays are used in an attempt to exceed performance of a given market exposure through investments in another, often unrelated, asset class. For example, an investment in the S&P 500 Index obtained by purchasing constituent stocks of the index will equal the performance of the S&P 500. However, if the exposure is obtained synthetically using futures or swaps, the return to the investor will be equal to the return of the S&P 500 Index, less a financing rate, plus the return on the cash collateral portfolio (as futures and swaps do not require the investor to pay for the market exposure up front, but instead only that they post initial margin and mark-to-market payments). To the extent that the collateral portfolio outperforms the financing rate (~0% in the current market environment), the investor should achieve a return that exceeds that of the S&P 500 Index. For further discussion on portable alpha strategies and risks see, for example, “Portable Alpha – Theory and Practice” published by Wiley Finance. 
Currency overlays are used to hedge currency exposures of the plan, when managed passively, or to take active views in the foreign exchange market, when managed actively. Currency overlays often are complementary to both rebalancing and completion overlays because plans that invest in foreign securities usually hedge at least some part of their currency exposure back to their home currency. 
Liability-driven investment (LDI) or duration overlays are generally used to hedge the interest rate risk arising from pension plan liabilities. Most overlays are implemented using swaps, futures or bond forwards. In the plain-vanilla case, plans match all or part of their liability structure based on duration, key rate duration, curve and/or convexity. Some of the more complicated strategies involve optionality, for example using swaption collars, or even active management. 
Hedge fund replication or hedge fund completion overlays are strategies that intend to replicate exposures to common factors in hedge funds. Hedge fund replication is based on the premise that part of hedge fund returns can be attributed to directional, persistent exposures (such as credit risk) or to strategies (e.g. momentum-based investing) that can be systematically replicated using sophisticated statistical techniques. These replication strategies are typically offered for a fraction of the cost traditional hedge funds charge. Replication strategies are relatively new, so judging the investment merits of replacing part of the traditional hedge fund allocation in investment portfolios is still difficult to assess. 
Tail-risk hedging strategies are among the more advanced recent additions to a pension manager’s toolkit. The hedges are investments in options that are designed to mitigate large, unexpected adverse moves in the market, similar to 2008. Many of these strategies are actively managed, as the cost of purchasing options can be substantial, especially during times of market turbulence. In addition, the hedges often need to be rebalanced, especially in the event of large market moves. 
Completion overlays are most often used to line up the overall plan exposure with targets that cannot be achieved through the combination of the underlying investment management mandates, either because requiring managers to do so would materially hamper their ability to generate added value or because physical assets are temporarily unavailable to be deployed to achieve those targets. For example, a plan with a substantial (but temporary) cash position could employ a completion overlay to equitize the cash position by purchasing equity futures. Sometimes, hedge fund replication strategies and some dynamically-adjusted liability hedge overlays are also called “completion strategies” as they may be used to accomplish a plan’s overall target market exposures. 
Rebalancing overlays are used to implement asset class rebalancing for the overall pension plan, typically using derivative instruments. The main benefit of these strategies is that they typically allow the realignment of asset class exposure with investment policy targets at a lower transaction cost than using sales of physical securities. Rebalancing overlay strategies are also potentially less disruptive to the active managers in the pension plan because there is no need to move physical assets between the managers. 
Tactical Asset Allocation Overlays (TAA) or Global Tactical Asset Allocation overlays (GTAA) are actively managed strategies and may be part of a rebalancing overlay or standalone mandates. Instead of deriving the desired market exposures from the strategic asset allocation, the targets for these overlays are determined through a quantitative or qualitative investment process, resulting in intentional deviations from the strategic long-term allocation. 
Interestingly, very few investment managers offer all of these various kinds of overlay strategies, either individually or as one package. Most managers have specialized either in passive overlays, active overlays or tail-risk hedging. 
Key benefits of overlays Higher capital efficiency. Most plans require some level of cash buffer in order to manage contributions and benefit payments, so they typically encounter some “cash drag” (i.e. potentially lower expected returns over time). For example, if a plan maintains 5% in cash and has an asset allocation that would generally be expected to deliver 6% to 7% returns, cash drag can be 30 to 35 basis points annually – similar in magnitude to all the investment management fees paid by the typical plan in a given year! Using overlays, this drag can be managed, as cash can be converted to equity, fixed income or some other asset class exposure without detracting significantly from the need for liquidity. 
In fact, virtually all of the traditional and exotic beta exposures of a plan can be replicated using synthetic overlays. This may allow for additional efficiencies to be gained, for example, through portable alpha strategies. As described earlier, these strategies may allow us to combine the risk and factor exposures of multiple asset classes in an effort to generate excess returns. 
Lower transaction costs. Transaction costs using physical securities can be substantial. Derivative instruments have therefore provided a more efficient way of executing month-to-month rebalancing activities for plans. For example, after a strong month in equity performance, a plan can have a position in equities that is larger than the exposure called for by the plan’s strategic asset allocation. Under this circumstance, the plan can sell equities outright by redeeming them from one of the underlying asset managers for cash and depositing the cash with a fixed income manager. Alternatively, they can use an overlay strategy to sell equity futures and purchase fixed income futures – potentially reducing transaction costs substantially. 
Savings in transaction costs should be weighed against potential basis risk introduced by using derivatives to replicate a physical market exposure. For example, equity exposure can often be replicated with relatively low tracking error. On the other hand, replication of other asset classes, like fixed income credit, often lead to more significant tracking error. As such, rebalancing overlays may be more effective for relatively small rebalancing transactions. Larger asset allocation adjustments should usually be implemented through the physical market. Figure 2 illustrates the estimated tradeoffs between transaction costs and basis risk. 

 
It should be noted that total return swaps can potentially provide both low basis risk and low transaction costs, but they present additional hurdles: transaction costs can be highly variable, and at times of market stress swaps may become unavailable given that they typically consume broker/dealer balance sheet capacity (unlike futures). Further, swaps require additional considerations related to rebalancing the exposure over time. Resizing a futures position is a simple buy/sell transaction, whereas resizing an OTC swap requires amending legal swap contracts, which can be both cumbersome and costly. 
Lastly, whether the derivatives are traded on an exchange or over the counter, changes in the mark-to-market value of the position usually will result in the receipt of collateral or the need to post collateral on a daily basis. It follows that a plan making use of such strategies will want to ensure that a sufficient supply of liquid, eligible collateral instruments is on hand to satisfy potential margin or collateral calls and that the plan has the required operational and management capabilities to handle the complexities arising from use of derivatives. 
Increased precision in risk management.Overlay strategies can also provide additional precision when attempting to reduce different risks in the pension plan. Pension liabilities are a great example: In typical LDI assignments, the portfolio manager seeks to construct a portfolio that more or less matches different drivers of liability risk. Those liability risk factors include duration, convexity (sensitivity of duration to large changes in yields), curve risk and spread exposure, among others. However, the specific targets that must be achieved by an LDI portfolio to control liability risk may be inconsistent with the latitude required by active managers to maintain the potential for value added. Indeed, trying to replicate liability risk factors using physical instruments could force fixed income managers into a fairly narrow segment of the market, as illustrated by Figure 3. 
 

 
As Figure 3 shows, exclusive use of physical securities may ultimately result in increased concentration risk, forced accumulation of unattractive securities and limited potential for alpha given the narrow universe of securities that match the characteristics of the liability discount rate (e.g. Barclays U.S. Long Corporate AA Index). The ability to incorporate derivatives overlays into an LDI program allows the plan sponsor to expand the physical fixed income investment universe beyond the boundaries implied by liability discount curves while still maintaining the ability to match with liability risk factors. 
In addition, these liability risk factors can be expected to fluctuate over time as inputs like discount rates or the demographic profile of the plan change. In those circumstances it may be more efficient to rebalance the LDI portfolio towards liability targets using derivatives. Otherwise, the portfolio adjustments would likely lead to relatively small sales and purchases of physical securities that could drive transaction costs up. 
More efficient transition management. We estimate that an average plan changes at least one manager every year, causing 2% to 5% of the plan’s assets to experience some form of transition. During these transitions, derivative overlays can be used to maintain the desired market exposure. For example, if a given equity manager is terminated, plans may find it useful to ask the manager to liquidate and purchase futures to maintain equity exposure. As illustrated earlier, this methodology can substantially reduce transaction costs but may result in high basis risk. 
Expression of tactical views. Overlays also can be used to express tactical views. One of the recent approaches that we have found to be interesting and applicable to pension plans is to purchase long duration credit securities and create an overlay that is designed to reduce the interest rate duration. This way, plans can take advantage of the new issuance and availability of long duration corporate credit but at the same time avoid taking additional interest rate risk given the low yield environment. Figure 4 illustrates the implementation of the strategy, using interest rate swap instruments to create an overlay that reduces interest rate duration. In this case, we compare the duration of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index to the combined duration of Barclays Capital Long Credit Index plus a hypothetical interest rate swap overlay hedge. 

In essence, plan sponsors are facing a dilemma when it comes to deploying money into fixed income in the current market environment. Many plan sponsors want to ultimately increase their allocation to long-dated corporate bonds to better match assets with liabilities, but also want to delay implementation until rates rise to a certain extent and make yields on these bonds more attractive. 
However, long corporate bonds are in short supply relative to potential demand from pension funds and insurance companies. And if rates were to rise meaningfully, a significant number of plan sponsors who currently sit on the sidelines might try to enter the market at the same time as yields reach more attractive levels. This would magnify the supply/demand imbalance existing in the long-dated corporate bond market and could make implementation more challenging. The use of derivatives can help solve this dilemma by letting plan sponsors accumulate long duration corporate bonds without being exposed to the significant interest rate risk that is typically associated with those securities. 
Hedge fund replication. Lastly, some plans are considering replacing part of their hedge fund allocations with hedge fund replication strategies, which use algorithms that mimic hedge fund performance. These strategies are relatively new, but are increasingly being offered by sell-side and buy-side firms alike. It is too early to judge whether these strategies will become a core part of pension plans’ investment roster. 
Practical considerations on implementation It is worth noting that these potential benefits also come with some degree of additional risk. For example, operational risks associated with derivatives can be significant, and the changing regulatory landscape may impose unexpected costs, especially if pension plans intend to implement the strategies using in-house resources. 
The first risk to consider is operational risk. Running derivative overlays requires expertise in execution, settlement and collateralization of derivative instruments, and very robust processes that support the potentially rapid turnaround times associated with management of the overlay. For example, collateral calls must be satisfied typically within T+0 or T+1 timeframe, or the position may end up being closed. Invariably, for most plans, outsourcing the execution of their overlays is the preferred option as they can then rely on the operational expertise of professional asset managers. Another operational consideration is the fact that communication between parties is typically more frequent for overlay strategies than it is for traditional full-authority asset management mandates (see Figure 5). For example, when executing a mandate, a rebalancing overlay manager needs access to the client’s overall target asset allocation as well as the market values of each underlying account or mandate. It is also likely that any change in asset allocation or cash flow will need to be communicated formally in order to avoid any potential misallocations in the overlay. A lack of industry-wide communication standards makes effective communication all the more difficult. 

 
Counterparty and legal risks require specialist expertise to manage. A large amount of derivatives trading takes place “over the counter” using individually negotiated agreements which spell out terms such as how collateral is posted and which securities are eligible as collateral instruments. It is important that these contracts are negotiated with a great degree of care placed on securing the performance of the counterparty under all market conditions. In addition to contractual considerations, continuous credit monitoring of all transaction counterparties is important and requires substantial credit analysis resources. 
Liquidity and collateral considerations are also extremely important. As discussed earlier, collateral is typically required for transacting in all derivative instruments, as derivative counterparties require periodic exchanges of collateral in order to secure the unrealized gains or losses due to the other party. Sizing the overlay strategies in relation to available liquid assets is necessary from a risk-management perspective, as significant market moves can require raising additional liquid assets in a short period of time. The degree of liquidity that needs to be held is directly related to the size of the overlay positions, volatility of the instruments used and terms of permissible collateral. It should be noted that the types of eligible collateral for OTC transactions can be negotiated with the counterparties as part of the master agreement and could therefore include nearly any asset type. Commonly, however, only cash, Treasury bills and sometimes Treasury bonds are used as collateral. (Prior to the credit crisis, many counterparties accepted a wider range of instruments.) 
Lastly, “basis risk” refers to the risk of a given derivative experiencing performance that is deviating from the underlying target instrument. As illustrated earlier, tradeoffs exist between transaction costs and basis risk. It should be noted that over short periods of time basis risk can arise also from instruments that are considered to have virtually no basis risk over the maturity of the instrument. For example, a total return swap may perform without any basis risk if held to maturity, but if it becomes necessary to adjust the size of the position, temporary dislocations can force the value of the swap to deviate from the market price of underlying physical instruments. 
Another aspect of basis risk is related to the funding cost of the derivative instruments. For example, if overlays are used to convert S&P 500 equity exposures to Russell 2000 (small cap) exposures, and embedded funding cost in the relevant derivative instruments is higher for Russell 2000 exposure than S&P 500 exposure, the strategy will underperform a similar transaction executed through physical instruments (excluding the impact of transaction costs). 
Conclusion Notwithstanding some of the confusion around terminology, overlay strategies have become a mainstay of pension fund management. These strategies can be an effective tool for pension managers, both in terms of enhancing return opportunities and assisting in reduction of unwanted risks. There are multiple considerations for each strategy, however, and a careful assessment of both the potential benefits, risks and costs should be conducted prior to implementation.

Article DisclaimerPast performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit and inflation risk. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Swaps are a type of derivative; swaps are increasingly subject to central clearing and exchange-trading. Swaps that are not centrally cleared and exchange-traded may be less liquid than exchange-traded instruments. Tail risk hedging may involve entering into financial derivatives that are expected to increase in value during the occurrence of tail events. Investing in a tail event instrument could lose all or a portion of its value even in a period of severe market stress. A tail event is unpredictable; therefore, investments in instruments tied to the occurrence of a tail event are speculative. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may reduce the returns of a portfolio. 
There is no guarantee that these investment strategies will work under all market conditions or are suitable for all investors and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest long-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market. No representation is being made that any account, product, or strategy will or is likely to achieve profits, losses, or results similar to those shown. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have several inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual performance and are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. There are frequently sharp differences between simulated performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular account, product, or strategy. In addition, since trades have not actually been executed, simulated results cannot account for the impact of certain market risks such as lack of liquidity. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or the implementation of any specific investment strategy, which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of simulated results and all of which can adversely affect actual results. 
The Barclays Long Corporate Index is a component of the Barclays U.S. Long Credit index. Barclays U.S. Long Credit Index is the credit component of the Barclays US Government/Credit Index, a widely recognized index that features a blend of US Treasury, government-sponsored (US Agency and supranational), and corporate securities limited to a maturity of more than ten years. Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index represents securities that are SEC-registered, taxable, and dollar denominated. The index covers the U.S. investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through securities, and asset-backed securities. These major sectors are subdivided into more specific indices that are calculated and reported on a regular basis. The Russell 2000 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000 Index, which represents approximately 10% of the total market capitalization of the Russell 3000 Index. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged market index generally considered representative of the stock market as a whole. The index focuses on the Large-Cap segment of the U.S. equities market. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.
