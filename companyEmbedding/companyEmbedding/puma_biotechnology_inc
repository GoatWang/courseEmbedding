PB272 (neratinib) is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or TKI, that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, or EGFRs, HER1, HER2 and HER4. We believe neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of several cancers, including breast cancer and gastric cancer. Our initial focus is on the development of neratinib as an oral treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

Data were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in March 2010 from a Phase II trial of neratinib administered as a single agent to patients with HER2+ metastatic breast cancer. The trial involved a total of 136 patients, 66 of whom had received prior treatment with approved anticancer drug Herceptin (trastuzumab), and 70 of whom had not received prior treatment with Herceptin (trastuzumab). The results of the study showed that neratinib was reasonably well tolerated among both the pretreated patients and the patients who had not received prior treatment with trastuzumab.

The efficacy results from the trial showed that the objective response rate was 24% for patients who had received prior trastuzumab treatment and was 56% for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Furthermore, the median progression free survival was shown to be 22.3 weeks for the patients who had received prior trastuzumab and 39.6 weeks for the patients who had not received prior trastuzumab, as show on the table below.

Neratinib is currently being tested in a number of clinical trials as a neoadjuvant therapy for patients with HER2+ breast cancer and as a treatment for patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer.  A list of clinical trials for neratinib can be found at:

Here’s why some say it’s time to tread carefully with Netflix shares

Puma jumps after FDA approval of breast-cancer treatment
Puma Biotechnology Inc.  jumped as much as 11.5% in late trading Monday after the company announced that the Food and Drug Administration had approved a breast-cancer treatment for medical use. The medicine, which will be marketed as Nerlynx and is expected to hit the market in September, is used after traditional treatment to avoid recurrence of HER2 breast cancer. Puma said up to one in four patients experience recurrence after treatment, but studies of its drug showed a 34% reduction in recurrence. "HER2-positive breast cancers are aggressive tumors and can spread to other parts of the body, making adjuvant therapy an important part of the treatment plan," Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence, said in the FDA's announcement. "Now, these patients have an option after initial treatment that may help keep the cancer from coming back." Puma shares moved as high as $96 in late trading after closing at $86.10, though prices settled at closer to $92 later in the after-hours session. The stock enjoyed a larger surge after an FDA panel recommended its approval in May, and has gained more than 117% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 index  has gained less than 5%.

Puma Biotech shares surge 20% after FDA advisory committee votes in favor of approving breast cancer drug
Puma Biotechnology Inc. shares  surged 20% in afternoon trade Wednesday, after the company said an advisory committee for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has voted 12 to 4 in favor of recommending approval for the company's neratinib treatment for breast cancer. The vote came after a review of the clinical development program for the drug, which aims to prevent recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients. Puma stock already rallied Tuesday, after the FDA released favorable briefing documents for the advisory committee meeting. The stock has gained 135% in 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Puma Biotech stock surges 50% on favorable FDA release for breast cancer drug
Puma Biotechnology Inc.  shares surged 49.2% to $56.30 in morning trade Monday after the Food and Drug Administration released favorable briefing documents for an advisory committee meeting this week that will review Puma Biotech's breast cancer drug. The benefits of the drug, which addresses an unmet need after the standard of care second-line cancer therapy, outweigh its risks, according to the FDA briefing documents. The most common side side effect of the drug was diarrhea, with 95% of patients in clinical trials experiencing it, and 40% of patients experienced serious, or what's called grade 3, diarrhea, the documents said. The FDA's oncologic drugs advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday. Advisory committee recommendations are considered by the FDA when deciding whether to approve a drug. Puma Biotech shares have surged 64.6% over the last three months, compared with a 1.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

Here’s why some say it’s time to tread carefully with Netflix shares

Puma jumps after FDA approval of breast-cancer treatment
Puma Biotechnology Inc.  jumped as much as 11.5% in late trading Monday after the company announced that the Food and Drug Administration had approved a breast-cancer treatment for medical use. The medicine, which will be marketed as Nerlynx and is expected to hit the market in September, is used after traditional treatment to avoid recurrence of HER2 breast cancer. Puma said up to one in four patients experience recurrence after treatment, but studies of its drug showed a 34% reduction in recurrence. "HER2-positive breast cancers are aggressive tumors and can spread to other parts of the body, making adjuvant therapy an important part of the treatment plan," Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence, said in the FDA's announcement. "Now, these patients have an option after initial treatment that may help keep the cancer from coming back." Puma shares moved as high as $96 in late trading after closing at $86.10, though prices settled at closer to $92 later in the after-hours session. The stock enjoyed a larger surge after an FDA panel recommended its approval in May, and has gained more than 117% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 index  has gained less than 5%.

Puma Biotech shares surge 20% after FDA advisory committee votes in favor of approving breast cancer drug
Puma Biotechnology Inc. shares  surged 20% in afternoon trade Wednesday, after the company said an advisory committee for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has voted 12 to 4 in favor of recommending approval for the company's neratinib treatment for breast cancer. The vote came after a review of the clinical development program for the drug, which aims to prevent recurrence in early-stage breast cancer patients. Puma stock already rallied Tuesday, after the FDA released favorable briefing documents for the advisory committee meeting. The stock has gained 135% in 2017 so far, while the S&P 500  has gained 7%.

Puma Biotech stock surges 50% on favorable FDA release for breast cancer drug
Puma Biotechnology Inc.  shares surged 49.2% to $56.30 in morning trade Monday after the Food and Drug Administration released favorable briefing documents for an advisory committee meeting this week that will review Puma Biotech's breast cancer drug. The benefits of the drug, which addresses an unmet need after the standard of care second-line cancer therapy, outweigh its risks, according to the FDA briefing documents. The most common side side effect of the drug was diarrhea, with 95% of patients in clinical trials experiencing it, and 40% of patients experienced serious, or what's called grade 3, diarrhea, the documents said. The FDA's oncologic drugs advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Wednesday. Advisory committee recommendations are considered by the FDA when deciding whether to approve a drug. Puma Biotech shares have surged 64.6% over the last three months, compared with a 1.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

(PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced the presentation of positive results from an ongoing Phase II clinical trial (Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium TBCRC 022) of Puma's investigational drug PB272 (neratinib) for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. The data were presented today in an oral presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting in Chicago, Illinois.The multicenter Phase II clinical trial enrolled patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have brain metastases. The trial is being performed by the TBCRC and enrolled three cohorts of patients. Patients in the first cohort (n=40) included those with progressive brain metastases who were administered neratinib monotherapy. Data from this cohort were previously reported at the 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2016. Patients in the second cohort (n=5) represent patients who had brain metastases which were amenable to surgery and who were administered neratinib monotherapy prior to and after surgical resection. The third cohort (target enrollment=60) enrolled two sub-groups of patients (prior lapatinib-treated and no prior lapatinib) with progressive brain metastases who were administered neratinib in combination with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine. The oral presentation reflects only the patients in the third cohort of patients without prior lapatinib exposure (cohort 3A, n=37), who all had progressive brain metastases at the time of enrollment and who received the combination of capecitabine plus neratinib. A full copy of the oral presentation that was presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting is available on the Puma Biotechnology website. Results from the second cohort and cohort 3B (prior lapatinib-treated) will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting.In cohort 3A, 30% of the patients had received prior craniotomy, 65% of the patients had received prior whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and 35% had received prior stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to the brain. No patients had received prior treatment with lapatinib.The primary endpoint of the trial was central nervous system (CNS) Objective Response Rate according to a composite criteria that included volumetric brain MRI measurements, steroid use, neurological signs and symptoms, and RECIST evaluation for non-CNS sites. The secondary endpoint of the trial was CNS response by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) Criteria. The efficacy results from the trial showed that 49% of patients experienced a CNS Objective Response by the composite criteria. The results also showed that the CNS response rate using the RANO-BM criteria was 24%. The median time to CNS progression was 5.5 months and the median overall survival was 13.5 months, though 49% of patients remain alive and survival data are immature.The results for cohort 3A showed that the most frequently observed severe adverse event for the 37 patients evaluable for safety was diarrhea. Patients received antidiarrheal prophylaxis consisting of high dose loperamide, given together with the combination of capecitabine plus neratinib for the first cycle of treatment in order to try to reduce the neratinib-related diarrhea. Among the 37 patients evaluable for safety, 32% of the patients had grade 3 diarrhea and 41% had grade 2 diarrhea.“Neratinib given in combination with capecitabine showed promising activity in patients with heavily pre-treated HER2-positive disease metastatic to the CNS,” said Rachel A. Freedman, MD, MPH, Breast Oncology Center, Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. “Despite the introduction of several new treatments for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, CNS progression events remain a major source of patient morbidity and mortality. Based on the results from TBCRC-022, we look forward to additional trials with neratinib-based regimens for HER2-positive CNS disease.”“We are very pleased with the activity seen in this trial with the combination of neratinib plus capecitabine,” said Alan H. Auerbach, CEO and President of Puma Biotechnology. “As a small molecule that can cross the blood brain barrier, neratinib potentially offers patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the CNS a novel HER2 targeted treatment option. We look forward to working with TBCRC on future trials of neratinib in patients with HER2-positive disease metastatic to the CNS.”Read MoreAbout Puma BiotechnologyPuma Biotechnology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care. The Company in-licenses the global development and commercialization rights to three drug candidates—PB272 (neratinib (oral)), PB272 (neratinib (intravenous)) and PB357. Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. Currently, the Company is primarily focused on the development of the oral version of neratinib, and its most advanced drug candidates are directed at the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The Company believes that neratinib has clinical application in the treatment of several other cancers as well, including non-small cell lung cancer and other tumor types that over-express or have a mutation in HER2.
