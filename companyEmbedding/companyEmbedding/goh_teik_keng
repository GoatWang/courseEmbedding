Not a done deal yet

A CLASSIC case of buy on rumour and sell on news. This can best describe Halex Holdings Bhd, a Johor Baru-based agrochemicals company that stirred investors interest with a gaming venture in Cambodia.
On Sept 14, the company announced a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with one Datuk Seri Stanley Goh Teik Keng, the major shareholder of VW Win Holdings plc that operates a licensed lottery gaming business in Cambodia. The agreement is to pave the way for Halex’s entry into the gaming business in Cambodia.
However, prior to the stock-exchange filing, Halex’s share price had shot up in the two trading days preceding the announcement. The shares closed at 64 sen on Sept 14, jumping more than 88% in two trading days from the Sept 10 close of 34 sen.
Following the announcement, the share price has steadily fallen throughout the week. It closed at 51 sen yesterday. 
Halex is proposing to acquire a 51% stake in the privately-held VW Win from Goh. There are conditions attached to the MoU that must be fulfilled by Dec 10.
The conditions, in a nutshell, include obtaining an online gaming licence, a due diligence exercise by the acquirer and an undertaking by Goh guaranteeing that VW Win’s net profit from the financial year 2016 will not be less than US$3mil (RM12.75mil) per year for the next three years.
Goh is linked to the Century Dynasty group, which started off in network marketing and has now diversified into coal mining in Indonesia, shipping in Singapore and investment advisory in Hong Kong.
For a more sustainable share price movement, investors would like to see certainty. In this respect, if VW Win had already obtained the online gaming licence before the announcement to Bursa Malaysia, it would have added more bite to the stock. As it is, the interest in Halex’s share price will only resume when there are further developments to the deal.
Lesson from Glencore
THE speed and ease at which commodity giant, Glencore Plc managed to raise US$2.5bil to beef up its balance sheet is testimony to why companies should always be generous to reward shareholders in good times.
Among those who took up the fund raising were chief executive Ivan Glasenberg and his key people. They put in almost US$500mil to take up the new shares that the company issued.
The share placement was also backed by key shareholders such as Harris Associates of Chicago that has close to 5% and Glencore’s biggest shareholder Qatar Holdings that maintained its 9%.
Some shareholders have complained that the offer to subscribe for new shares should be given to all. While it is true, the company in its defence has said that the exercise was offered to selected shareholders because of speed in completing the transaction. 
Coming to the exercise, it is no surprise that the institutional shareholders managed to raise that kind of money quick. But what was surprising is the amount that the top management poured into the company. Glasenberg and the top two executives subscribed for shares worth US$371mil.
Glencore has been hit by the collapse of commodities from copper to zinc and oil. The reason why the top management were able to put more money into the company during hard times is because they have been well rewarded during the good times.
According to a report, the top three executives have received US$1.35bil in dividends since Glencore was listed in 2011. Amazing returns.
Glencore issued almost 10% of new shares to raise US$2.5bil as part of an effort to cut its debt by a third to US$20bil. The company that buys and sells minerals and even own mines is hit by the collapse of prices. 
Its credit rating is under pressure from the agencies. But the commitment by management is a sign that it would recover from its problems.
No hike, more volatility
MANY thought it would be a 50:50 decision whether the US Federal Open Market Committee raises interest rates on Thursday. 
We now know that the decision was made to postpone a hike in US interest rates by the US Federal Reserve until the next meeting in December when a decision will be made during that meeting.
The reason given for not raising interest rates was uncertainty. Global markets outside of the US are wobbly, especially China, and even the US Fed has an eye on China and elsewhere before it makes a decision on raising interest rates.
The delay in hiking interest rates is also partly due to slow inflation and also the strength of the US economy, where job growth has been on a steady path. 
It’s understandable why the US Fed acted not to act in hiking rates but postponing an interest rate hike will only continue to drive uncertainty that international markets are experiencing.
By all accounts, the economic slowdown in China has little to do with US interest rates. It’s a function of economic activity in China that is reacting to a different pulse than what is being seen in the US.
The delay in hiking rates also prolongs the turmoil in the currency markets. Many currencies of emerging markets, in particular Malaysia, has been battered by a flight of capital to the US in anticipation of a liftoff.
The much awaited event was a letdown and right now, volatility is set to continue. The symbolic 25 basis point hike would have not mattered much as interest rates are next to nothing but should interest rates had experienced the lift-off many were anticipating, that would have calmed down the capital flight seen in emerging markets.
The markets now have to wait to December and the it is hoped that by that time, there will be more clarity on the health of international economies before such action is taken. The only worry is that if the world’s economy is not in better health by then, will we see yet another delay in the raising of interest rates in the US?
