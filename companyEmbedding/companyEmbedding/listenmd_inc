Patent-pending machine learning tech reduces physician data entry at a fraction of scribe cost1of3 The Story:

Our global healthcare system faces a crisis of physician burnout
• Physicians now spend 50% of their time doing data entry into electronic health records systems and only 12% of their time with patients. 
• In a recent survey, 90% of physicians said that they would not recommend medicine as a profession.
 
The medical scribe market is large and growing, but most practices and hospitals can't afford to employ people to do data entry for physicians
• 20,000 scribes in the US, projected to be 100,000 by 2020
• Average cost of a scribe is over $60,000 per doctor per year
 
Listen.MD provides a brand new approach: an intelligent Digital Scribe™ to reduce physician data entry for a fraction of what they would pay today. This new approach has significant benefits:
• Increase revenue 
• Reduce physician burnout
• Focused, personal interaction leads to improved patient satisfactionListen.MDDenver, CO, United StatesJoinorLoginTo view the full profile, meet the team, get updates, news and investment details, or connect with this or any company on the network.Learn moreMapOKCloseEngaging as an Would you like us to send a message to this startup's management team requesting information on becoming an ?YesNoVerify Your Account : Step 3Thank you for registeringVerify Your Account : Step 3We have sent you an email to verify your account.
