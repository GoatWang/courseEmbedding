					Full Description



TransBiotec, Inc., incorporated on August 10, 2007, is a development-stage company that has developed an alcohol detection device, SOBR. The Company's SOBR is designed for use in detecting alcohol in a person's system by measuring the ethanol content in their perspiration. The Company plans to market its product to two primary business segments, companies and institutions that employ or contract with vehicle drivers, where the system will be marketed as a preventative drunk driving detection system, with an ignition locking device, and companies and institutions that have an interest in monitoring their employees' or contractors' alcohol level due to their job responsibilities, such as surgeons prior to entering surgery, pilots prior to flying aircraft and the military for personnel returning to a military base from off-base leave.The Company is performing beta testing of SOBR. SOBR determines whether alcohol level is over or under a preset level as set by the installer or a technician. SOBR works by having an individual touch a sensor for approximately six seconds. The sensor is specific to ethanol and detects ethanol secreted through sweat that emanates from the hands. SOBR is produced in over two basic forms, including an in-vehicle system that can be connected to an interlock system to prevent the operation of the vehicle in the event when the sensor detects measurable ethanol content, and a portable unit that can be used anywhere. The in-vehicle unit can be used in machines, including automobiles, buses, trucks, boats and aircraft. If the vehicle is fitted with an interlock device, then the ethanol level is translated into an engine start or no-start signal.SOBR can also initiate random real-time tests while the vehicle is operating to ensure that the operator's ethanol level does not increase over the preset limit after the vehicle is started. If the system is tampered with while parked, the vehicle will not start. If the device is tampered with while driving, alarms will activate, such as the vehicle lights and horn, drawing attention to the vehicle. If a vehicle is equipped with a global positioning system or data transmission module, SOBR can alert fleet operators or others monitoring a vehicle of the detection of alcohol above preset levels. SOBR requires approximately one hour to be installed in a vehicle. The control box can be mounted under the dash in the interior of the vehicle. In new vehicles the sensor can be installed as part of the steering wheel. In retrofits, the sensor is installed on the dashboard for access.The portable unit is similar in size and looks to a black, non-flip mobile telephone and can be temporarily attached to a solid fixture for usage. The portable unit can be used to test individuals before they are allowed to perform certain functions. As a portable unit, the system will signal through the use of lights whether the tested individual is over a preset level. A company utilizing the device may then use the information how it sees fit. The Company plans to market SOBR to the voluntary commercial market, including commercial transportation companies that operate tractor trailers, taxis, construction vehicles, boats, trains, aircraft and other vehicles; local, state and federal government agencies that operate fire trucks, police cars and public transportation systems; individuals that desire to monitor a family member's vehicle, such as a vehicle operated by a minor, and various government and military employees, such as sailors in the Navy who might be tested before boarding a ship after off-base leave. It is also focused on marketing its products to the original equipment manufacturing (OEM) market, where the device would be installed in new vehicles during the original building of a vehicle, and to companies that would want to provide knowledge to their customers of their current alcohol level, such as lounge and bar owners, or customers attending a golfing event.

          TransBioTec, Inc. announces that it has received a purchase order from its distributor, AG Global Capital for 250 of its SOBR Ignition Interlock Units.

SANTA ANA, Calif., April 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On September 10, 2014 TransBioTec Inc. (OTC: IMLE) announced the signing of a Master Distribution Agreement with AG Global Capital. Today the company is announcing that it has received a purchase order from AG Global Capital for 250 of the company's ignition interlock SOBR units.








Under the purchase order, the SOBR ignition interlock units will be installed in commercial trucks. The SOBR ignition interlock unit is designed to test the operator before the vehicle can be started by having the operator touch a sensor located in the SOBR device. The unit is preset to an ethanol alcohol concentration level specified by the fleet owner. If the test results are over the preset level, the unit will block the ignition signal. This is the first commercial sale of the SOBR product. TransBioTec's mission is to reduce alcohol related deaths, injuries and property damage. 
About TransBioTec, Inc.
TransBioTec, Inc. has developed and patented a non-invasive alcohol sensing system ("SOBR") which includes an ignition interlock.  The alcohol sensing system offers a unique solution to the national drunk driving problem that can now be applied to new markets. SOBR consists of two parts: an ethanol alcohol detection system and an ignition interlock device connected through a microprocessor. SOBR detects the ethanol alcohol level of the operator and does not allow the vehicle or equipment to start if the ethanol alcohol level is above a preset limit.  In addition, random real-time monitoring also ensures that the operator cannot continue to operate a vehicle with an unsafe alcohol level. TransBioTec is currently developing a handheld application that can be applied to several different markets. 
About AG Global Capital
AG Global Capital is a diverse financial and advisory company, located in Newport Beach, CA. The principals have decades of experience in international markets in both manufacturing, distribution and financing. AG Global Capital has formed a marketing and distribution arm specifically to market and sell TransBioTec's SOBR product in Turkey, Sweden and the GCC.
Forward Looking Statement
TransBioTec, Inc.'s statements in this press release that are not historical fact and that relate to future plans or events are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by use of words such as "believe," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements may prove incorrect and include risks associated with, expected results, regulatory approvals, and changes in business conditions and similar events. The risks and uncertainties involved include those detailed from time to time in  TransBioTec, Inc.'s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including TransBioTec, Inc.s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.
