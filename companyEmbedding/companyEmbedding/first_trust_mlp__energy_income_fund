PRESS RELEASE                                  SOURCE: First Trust Advisors L.P.



FIRST TRUST ADVISORS L.P. ANNOUNCES PORTFOLIO MANAGER UPDATE FOR FEI, FEN, FIF
AND FPL



WHEATON, IL -- (BUSINESS WIRE) -- April 21, 2017 -- First Trust Advisors L.P.
("FTA") announced today that Energy Income Partners, LLC ("EIP"), investment
sub-advisor for First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund (NYSE: FEI), First Trust
Energy Income and Growth Fund (NYSE MKT: FEN), First Trust Energy Infrastructure
Fund (NYSE: FIF), and First Trust New Opportunities MLP & Energy Fund (NYSE:

FPL) (the "Funds"), will release an update on the market and the Funds for
financial advisors and investors. The update will be available TUESDAY, APRIL
25, 2017 AT 5:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME UNTIL 11:59 P.M. EASTERN TIME ON WEDNESDAY,
MAY 24, 2017. To listen to the update, follow these instructions:


--  Dial: (888) 203-1112; International (719) 457-0820; and Passcode # 9058787.

The update will be available from Tuesday, April 25, 2017, at 5:00 P.M.
Eastern Time until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 24, 2017.


First Trust Advisors L.P., the Funds' investment advisor, along with its
affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies which
provide a variety of investment services, including asset management and
financial advisory services, with collective assets under management or
supervision of approximately $104 billion as of March 31, 2017 through unit
investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, mutual funds and
separate managed accounts.


EIP provides advisory services to a number of investment companies and
partnerships for the purpose of investing in MLPs and other energy
infrastructure securities. EIP is one of the early investment advisors
specializing in this area. As of March 31, 2017, EIP managed or supervised
approximately $5.9 billion in client assets.


Investment return and market value of an investment in the Funds will fluctuate.
Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.


Principal Risk Factors: The Funds are subject to risks, including the fact that
each Fund is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.


Because the Funds are concentrated in securities issued by MLPs, MLP-related
entities, and other energy and utilities companies, they will be more
susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those
industries, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of
economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties
concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy
conservation policies and other factors.


The Funds invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher
volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the Funds invest in non-U.S.
securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market
depreciates against the U.S. dollar.


The Funds' use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not
been used, may require the Funds to sell or purchase portfolio securities at
inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation the Funds can realize on
an investment, or may cause the Funds to hold a security that they might
otherwise sell.


There can be no assurance as to what portion of FIF's distributions paid to the
Fund's Common Shareholders will consist of tax-advantaged qualified dividend
income.


Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the
effect of any losses.


The risks of investing in the Funds are spelled out in the prospectus,
shareholder reports and other regulatory filings.


The Funds' daily New York Stock Exchange closing price and net asset value per
share as well as other related information can be found at www.ftportfolios.com
or by calling 1-800-988-5891.

Fact Sheet







First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund (FEI)




Fund Summary|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to shareholders. The Fund seeks to provide its shareholders with a vehicle to invest in a portfolio of cash-generating securities, with a focus on investing in publicly-traded master limited partnerships ("MLPs") and MLP-related entities in the energy sector and energy utilities industries. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 85% of its managed assets in equity and debt securities of MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utilities companies that the Fund's sub-advisor believes offer opportunities for growth and income and will invest at least 65% of its managed assets in equity securities issued by energy sector MLPs and energy sector and energy utilities MLP-related entities. To generate additional income, the Fund currently expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of its Managed Assets.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


6
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


7
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.













Risk Considerations

The fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.


    Because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by MLPs, MLP-related entities, and other energy and utilities companies, it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those industries, including high interest costs, high leverage costs, the effects of economic slowdown, surplus capacity, increased competition, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors.


    The fund invests in securities of non-U.S. issuers which are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. Because the fund invests in non-U.S. securities, you may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

First Trust MLP And Energy Income Fund Declares Its Monthly Common Share Distribution Of $0.1183 Per Share For July






Business Wire




Jun 20, 2017 5:32 PM EDT













 


















































  First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FEI) has declared the Fund's regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution in the amount of $0.1183 per share payable on July 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of July 6, 2017. The ex-dividend date is expected to be July 3, 2017. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below.      First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund (FEI):           Distribution per share:     $0.1183     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 NAV of $14.76:     9.62%     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 closing market price of $15.03:     9.45%      It is anticipated that, due to the tax treatment of cash distributions made by master limited partnerships ("MLPs") in which the Fund invests, a portion of the distributions the Fund makes to Common Shareholders may consist of a tax-deferred return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2017 will be made after the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.  The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions paid to common shareholders. The Fund seeks to provide its common shareholders with a vehicle to invest in a portfolio of cash-generating securities, with a focus on investing in publicly-traded MLPs and MLP-related entities in the energy sector and energy utilities industries. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests at least 85% of its managed assets in equity and debt securities of MLPs, MLP-related entities and other energy sector and energy utilities companies. To generate additional income, the Fund expects to write (or sell) covered call options on up to 35% of its managed assets.
