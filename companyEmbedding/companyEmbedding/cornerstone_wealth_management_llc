Resident Physician
As a resident physician, you have already invested a lot of time and work toward becoming a professional doctor. It is important that you protect that investment and ensure a more secure financial future for you and your family at this crucial point in your career. The steps needed to provide that desired level of security should be taken now.
Here are some ways that Cornerstone Wealth Management can work with you to help protect your investment and work right now towards a stronger financial future at the same time. Consider the following options.
Disability Insurance
It is very important to provide for a better future with physicians disability insurance. This necessary insurance protects your hard-earned income in the event of an accident that might prevent you from ever being able to work again. While accidents cannot be foreseen, foresight can enable you to be ready if it should occur.
Starting early with income insurance means even lower rates because they are based on your age. Special rates can be given for resident doctors which will continue into the early years of your medical practice. Disability insurance for doctors has rates that are guaranteed until the age of 65, when purchased from the right companies.
Another option for a lower rate is called graded premium disability insurance. On this type of doctor’s insurance plan, the premiums start low and then slowly increase. It also has guaranteed convertibility up until age 45.
Residents are able to get up to $3,500 per month income coverage regardless of their current income. An agreement with a future employer will enable more disability insurance to be purchased, if it should be needed.
Financial Planning
Cornerstone Wealth Management provides you with a full range of financial services to meet your every need. As financial advisers and coaches, we want to work with you to understand and then enable you to reach your financial goals. Most importantly, we maintain your discipline.  We are able to provide you with all your financial needs, which includes:
Insurance – Personal and BusinessBusiness Planning – when you are ready for itCash Flow and Debt EliminationInvestments and SavingsEducation Savings PlansAsset ManagementEstate PlanningAccess to All Your Financial Information – updated daily.

It is our goal to work with you to provide you with the financial strategies and advice you need to set and achieve your financial goals for yourself, your business, and for your family. We start out by sitting down with you and let you tell us what your goals are. Then, we draw up a carefully designed financial plan whereby you can start reaching toward those goals.
At that time, it is entirely up to you how you want to proceed. Implementing that plan will require a financial commitment on your part to let Cornerstone Wealth Management become your financial advisors and financial managers.

The Modern CPA
Progressive-minded CPA firms are always on the lookout for ways of providing the best possible service to their clients.  To serve the best interest of their clients, they constantly monitor both opportunities as well as threats to their clients' financial security.  To properly assess the threat, you may need new tools to evaluate your current referral process.
Referral Model or Strategic Alliance
Many CPA's paint financial service firms with the same brush and view them as similar to each other.  However, an Ernst & Young survey in 2003 concluded just the opposite. 
In the Executive Summary it stated the financial services industry must take on the imperative of developing a new paradigm--a non-linear and non-piecemeal paradigm--that better suits the current economic climate as well as risks and uncertainties likely to be encountered by Baby Boomer's, Gen X's, and millenials in the future.
It also predicted the future when asked about why the changes were not being accelerated by the financial institutions.  The reasons were all too familiar:
Why risk fixing something that does not seem to be broken?Why invest time and money in new products and services that may not be as profitable as we sell today?How do we educate a sales force to take on the new paradigm?

There is not a shortage of information for the CPA firm which wants to enter the arena of wealth building and preservation.  Much of the information comes from financial firms, however, and is biased and designed to generate profits for the stockholders and officers. Cornerstone Wealth Management endeavors to maintain an independent advisor status, identifying and eliminating mis-information.  This is the first step in converting information to knowledge. 
Two Main Financial Powers
Interest rates, or rates of returnActuarial science;

Investment companies want to tell you that it should all be subject to long-term market historical performance.  Insurance companies and banks tell you it should not have any risk.  The key is to employ a macro-economic approach to find the perfect blend of each of the two powers.  Each power, left alone, is inadequate in planning.
Workshops
We provide a business consulting workshop on a quarterly basis and provide 3 hours of CPE credit to the CPA.  We can provide the same workshop to your business owner clients in a shorter format. 
We also provide a complete line-up of investor education workshops.  Please contact us for a list and description.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/02/2011
            

                BBB has determined that Cornerstone Wealth Management LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
