What Others Are Saying
"The view from the Volcano is Sand Valley's money shot. The mark of a great course is that it makes you feel special. The Sand Valley view, even without the benefit of an ocean, made me feel the same way. There were holes as far as the eye can see - some built, some just in my imagination. Thrilling."Gary Van Sickle | Golf Magazine
