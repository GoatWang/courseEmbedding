Rather than doing basic tasks, interns actually have the opportunity to contribute to the team.Multiple opportunities to learn about different firm functions (ops, accounting, legal, etc).Many employees from front office willing to let interns shadow them to gain an understanding of how trading, investment analysis, portfolio management, etc. is done at DKCM.Compensation is very competitive.ConsInternship could have been longer. Was only 7-8 weeks. Program would benefit from being 10-12 weeks.Advice to ManagementDevelop a front office undergraduate intern program that can teach promising undergrads the basics of buy-side investment analysis and trading. This will create a larger talent pool from which to hire new analysts.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Davidson Kempner Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Davidson Kempner Capital Management 2016-09-26 13:29 PDT 20 Oct 2015 Helpful (1)"Operations"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeProsGood life and work balanceConsVery little incentive and company is very bureaucraticShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Davidson Kempner Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Davidson Kempner Capital Management 2015-10-20 05:32 PDT 30 Jun 2015"Engineer"StarStarStarStarStarFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NY (US)Former Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NY (US)RecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsGood environment and culture with good pay.ConsGrown extensively over the past few years at cost of small company feelAdvice to ManagementContinue on path without forgetting about culture that made it so successful.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Davidson Kempner Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Davidson Kempner Capital Management 2015-06-30 13:32 PDT Is this helpful?

Management will listen and is happy to help.

Most shops close up in a few years but this has lasted over 30 years because of numerous reason:1. Great Culture - Work hard and you will get rewarded2. Open door policy - Management is always willing to support your goals3. Many benefits benefits that are not heard of in other companiesAnd most importantly, the people. The turnover is low due to the tight network and culture all around.ConsI would say N/A, but I guess the only con I can think of is that the hours are longer than your usual job.Advice to ManagementKeep the hiring to only exceptional employees. They will learn to understand the rewards.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Davidson Kempner Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Davidson Kempner Capital Management 2014-12-15 21:00 PST 20 Jun 2012 Helpful (4)"Excellent place to work with some of the most intelligent people in the industry"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeFormer Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookI worked at Davidson Kempner Capital Management full-time (More than 3 years)Prosvery smart people who treat each other with respect throughout the entire organizationexcellent long-term track recordhighest ethical standards in the industryinstitutional investors are flocking to this fund with good reasonConsstarting to get a bit large, so more difficult to maintain cultureAdvice to Managementkeep up the great workShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) Davidson Kempner Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Davidson Kempner Capital Management 2012-06-20 16:50 PDT 14 Mar 2010"great fund"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NY (US)Current Employee - Anonymous Employee in New York, NY (US)RecommendsProssmart, experienced investors, good communication,Conscan't think of any to giveAdvice to Managementcontinue to excelShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Davidson Kempner Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Davidson Kempner Capital Management 2010-03-14 08:03 PDTReviews > Davidson Kempner Capital Management RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR/Personnel or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR/Personnel or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompanies to Explore Company BenefitsDoctor's briefcaseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits Review Job Seekers Also ViewedBlueMountain Capital Management ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 14 ReviewsJ.P.
