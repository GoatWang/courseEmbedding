Home→Collections→Lockheed MartinPioneering woman feted as Entrepreneur of Year Founder: Kathryn C. Turner has nurtured her Standard Technology Inc. into a company with 150 employees and annual revenue of about $17 million.February 26, 1998|By Shanon D. Murray | Shanon D. Murray,SUN STAFFKathryn C. Turner has bucked trends all her life.Founder and chief executive of Standard Technology Inc. in Rockville, Turner has joined the slim ranks of African-American women who run multimillion-dollar companies.She started her consulting firm despite her father's belief that women have no business in business. And she earned a chemistry degree at Howard University in Washington after first having to desegregate the Alexandria, Va., school system.Turner is a staunch follower of Formula One racing."It costs about $50 million to build a car," said Turner, 50. "And when it's done, they've created a nice blend of performance and technology."Her colleagues say Turner has done the same with STI, which employs 150 and has annual revenue of about $17 million.For her accomplishments in building the privately held technology services company, Turner has been named the national Entrepreneur of the Year by the 12th annual Black Engineer of the Year Awards Conference. Turner was selected from among 70 nominees by a committee.The three-day awards conference begins at the Baltimore Convention Center today and is expected to attract nearly 8,000 college students and professionals from around the country.Turner was nominated by Norman R. Augustine, chairman of Lockheed Martin Corp.Augustine met Turner about six years after she started STI and while he was chief executive of Martin Marietta. Lockheed Martin is now a strategic partner of STI."Kathryn is an enormously capable business person," Augustine said."People will come to me now and again for advice and I will talk to them, and that would be the end of it. But I was sufficiently impressed with Kathryn, and I wanted to do anything I could to help her get her company on track."Founded in 1986, STI has offices in Virginia and Jacksonville, Fla. The company does information technology tasks for clients, performing such services as developing software and conducting engineering assessments. Its strategic plan includes developing a niche in health care.Its client list includes the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Defense Department and Raytheon Co.Turner, now a Bethesda resident, learned about entrepreneurship early.Her late father, George, was the founder of a chain of hair products stores in Maryland and Washington. He died last year, after selling his one remaining store."He believed women should be wives and mothers and shouldn't run a business," said Turner. "That was the only reason I didn't go into business with him."He wasn't happy when I started STI because he thought it would be too difficult a life for his daughter. But he quickly became my biggest fan."Her other fans include Gordon S. Macklin, a former president of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., who serves on STI's advisory committee."Like a lot of small businesses, STI has had its share of ups and downs," said Macklin, who was introduced to Turner by Augustine. "But in the last few years, it has grown nicely and profitably."After receiving her undergraduate degree in chemistry from Howard, Turner began her career with the Naval Ordnance Station in Charles County, then went on to work for other technology-related firms for 16 years.Three years after founding STI, the company acquired a manufacturing shop in Dallas, where it built products for weapons systems for the Defense Department. However, the department moved away from hardware and its budget was drastically cut. STI sold the division in 1995."Had she never been involved in manufacturing, STI would be spectacular right now," Macklin said. "But it showed her wisdom and strength that she was able to overcome that pitfall and reconstitute the business."STI was fully in the midst of the manufacturing mishap when Turner turned to Augustine at Martin Marietta for advice. After their brief conversation, Martin Marietta became STI's "mentor company" in a federal program. Lockheed Martin continued the relationship, which has served STI well.Lockheed Martin endorses the upstart as it goes after contracts and financing.Turner also serves on some of the same corporate boards as Augustine, such as that of Phillips Petroleum Corp. in Oklahoma.She can networkTurner, a divorced mother of a 26-year-old son, has been greatly helped by an ability to network."Everyone recognizes it's her strength," said Ronald N. Kirby, who was hired to be STI's president and chief operating officer five months ago. "And it's a good thing, because she's wonderful in the marketplace.""It's tough out here, and she has survived," said Joe Fuller, founder and president of Futron Corp. in Bethesda. He subleased office space from Turner a year after she started STI."She got in the door, but she has to perform to remain there."Turner was always a go-getter, fortified by having been one of nine students selected by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to integrate the Alexandria, Va., school system in the late 1950s. She was born in Chicago, but her family moved to Alexandria when she was a toddler.First blacks on blockTurner, her parents and younger brother and sister relocated to Washington when she was in the 10th grade, becoming the first black family on their block on upper 16th Street.Desegregating the white school and her Washington neighborhood prepared her for the business world, Turner said."I'm comfortable in settings where I'm the only African-American," Turner said. "I don't accept anyone's judgment that I am not capable."Pub Date: 2/26/98
