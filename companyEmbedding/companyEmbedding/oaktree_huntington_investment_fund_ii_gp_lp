Subscription Agreement
 
On the Closing Date, the Issuer and SunOpta Foods entered into the Subscription Agreement with the Oaktree Funds.  Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, SunOpta Foods issued an aggregate of 85,000 shares of Preferred Shares to the Oaktree Funds for consideration in the amount of $85,000,000 (the Aggregate Proceeds).  The Aggregate Proceeds have been used to prepay a portion of the principal outstanding under SunOpta Foods second lien loan agreement and pay expenses associated with the transaction.
 
The Subscription Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Issuer, SunOpta Foods and the Oaktree Funds, and the parties have agreed to indemnify each other against certain losses resulting from breaches of their respective representations, warranties and covenants.
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, on the Closing Date the Issuer and SunOpta Foods, as applicable, also entered into the Investor Rights Agreement, the Observer Agreement, the Exchange and Support Agreement and the Voting Trust Agreement (each as defined below).
 
This summary description of the Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Subscription Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 4 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Preferred Shares
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, SunOpta Foods has executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the Preferred Shares.  The Preferred Shares are a new class of equity securities that will rank senior to the Common Shares and any other shares junior to the Preferred Shares in the capital of SunOpta Foods with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation.
 
The holders of Preferred Shares (the Holders) will be entitled to receive quarterly distributions (Dividends) on each such share.  The annualized rate of the Dividends will be 8.0% prior to October 5, 2025, and 12.5% thereafter, in each case of $1,000 per share (the Liquidation Preference), subject to certain adjustments.  Prior to October 5, 2025, SunOpta Foods may pay Dividends in cash or elect, in lieu of paying cash, to add the amount that would have been paid to the Liquidation Preference.  On the occurrence of certain events of noncompliance (an Event of Noncompliance), following a 30-day cure period, the rate of Dividends payable will increase by 1.0% quarterly, subject to a maximum increase of 5.0%.  The failure to pay Dividends in cash after October 4, 2025 will be an Event of Noncompliance.
 
At any time the Holders may exchange their Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, for a number of Common Shares equal to, per Preferred Share, the quotient of the Liquidation Preference divided by $7.50 (such price, the Exchange Price and such quotient, the Exchange Rate).  The Exchange Price is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, including weighted-average adjustment for issuances of Common Shares below the Exchange Price, provided that the Exchange Price may not be lower than $7.00 (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances).
 
SunOpta Foods may cause the Holders to exchange all of the Preferred Shares into a number of Common Shares equal to the number of shares of Preferred Shares outstanding multiplied by the Exchange Rate if (i) fewer than 10% of the Preferred Shares issued on the Closing Date must remain outstanding or (ii) on or after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the average volume-weighted average price of the Common Shares during the then preceding 20 trading day period must be greater than 200% of the Exchange Price.  Common Shares delivered on an exchange caused by SunOpta Foods must be freely tradable by the Holders under applicable securities laws.
 
At any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, SunOpta Foods may redeem all of the Preferred Shares.  The amount to be paid by the Issuer to the Holders on redemption is an amount, per Preferred Share, equal to the Liquidation Preference.
 
17





 
Upon certain events involving a change of control of the Issuer, SunOpta Foods must use reasonable efforts to provide the Holders with the option to exchange Preferred Shares for a security in the surviving or successor entity that has the same rights, preferences and privileges as the Preferred Shares as adjusted for the change of control.  SunOpta Foods will also offer to redeem the Preferred Shares at an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to the value of incremental Dividends through to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the amount payable per Common Share in such change of control multiplied by the Exchange Rate. Such offer to redeem by SunOpta Foods will be made at an amount per share equal to the Liquidation Preference if the aggregate number of Common Shares delivered in exchange for Preferred Shares exceeds 17,130,757, which is 19.99% of the outstanding Common Shares on the day preceding the Closing Date (such number, Closing Date Shares).  If, following an offer by SunOpta Foods on a change of control, any Preferred Shares are redeemed at a per share price above the Liquidation Preference, the number of Preferred Shares that may thereafter be exchanged for Common Shares must not exceed the Closing Date Shares.
 
At any time if a Holder elects to exchange, or SunOpta Foods causes an exchange of, Preferred Shares, the number of Common Shares delivered to each applicable Holder may not cause such Holders beneficial ownership (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) to exceed 19.99% of the Common Shares that would be outstanding immediately following such exchange (the Beneficial Ownership Exchange Cap),  unless the Shareholder Approval has been obtained (as defined below).
 
So long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, the affirmative vote or consent of the Holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Shares, voting together as a separate class, will be necessary for effecting or validating: (i) any issuance of stock on parity or senior to the Preferred Shares, (ii) any increase in the issued or authorized amount of Preferred Shares, (iii) any exchange, reclassification or cancellation of the Preferred Shares, except as provided and (iv) any amendment, modification or alteration of, or supplement to, the certificate of incorporation of SunOpta Foods that would materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Preferred Shares or any Holder.
 
This summary description of the terms of the Preferred Shares does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of SunOpta Foods filed with this report as Exhibit 2 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Investor Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, the Issuer, SunOpta Foods and the Oaktree Funds entered into the Investor Rights Agreement dated October 7, 2016 providing for certain additional rights and obligations of the Oaktree Funds.
 
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, for so long as the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control at least 50% of the Preferred Shares issued on the Closing Date, including any corresponding Common Shares into which such Preferred Shares are exchanged, the Oaktree Funds will be entitled to:
 
(a)                                 participation rights with respect to future equity offerings of the Issuer; and
 
(b)                                 governance rights, including the right to approve certain actions proposed to be taken by the Issuer and its subsidiaries, as more particularly set out in the Investor Rights Agreement.
 
The Oaktree Funds will be entitled to designate two nominees (each an Investor Nominee) for election to the board of directors of the Issuer (the Board) for so long as the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control at least 11.1% of the Common Shares, on an as-exchanged basis.  If the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control less than 11.1% but more than 5% of the Common Shares, on an as-exchanged basis, they shall be entitled to designate one Investor Nominee.  Each Investor Nominee must be an individual acceptable to the Issuer, acting reasonably, and eligible to serve as a director of the Issuer pursuant to applicable Law.  In addition, for so long as the Oaktree Funds beneficially own or control at least 5% of the Common Shares, on an as-exchanged basis, the Oaktree Funds have the right to designate one individual (and one alternate) to attend meetings of the Board as a non-voting observer (the Observer);
 
The initial Investor Nominees are Dean Hollis and Albert D. Bolles, and were appointed as directors of the Issuer on October 7, 2016.
 
The Oaktree Funds have also been granted certain registration rights relating to the registered resale of Common Shares issuable or deliverable upon exchange of the Preferred Shares and certain Common Shares which may be purchased in the market or privately by the Oaktree Funds subject to limitations set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement (Registrable Shares).  Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Issuer is required to file a registration statement or prospectus, as
 
18





 
applicable, covering Registrable Shares that the Oaktree Funds request to be registered from time to time, but not more than twice in any 12-month period and subject to certain additional conditions set out in the Investor Rights Agreement.  In certain circumstances, the Oaktree Funds will have piggyback registration rights on offerings initiated by the Issuer.  The registration rights granted to the Oaktree Funds pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement terminate on the first day following the date on which the direct or indirect ownership interest of the Oaktree Funds of Common Shares on an as-exchanged basis is less than 5%.
 
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Oaktree Funds have agreed to a standstill with respect to the acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer, subject to certain exceptions.  Such exceptions include (a) pursuant to an agreement with the Issuer and the consent of the Board, acquiring Common Shares pursuant to a formal tender offer or take-over bid, which when aggregated with the existing Common Shares beneficially owned or controlled by the Oaktree Funds, on an as-exchanged basis, does not exceed 27% of the outstanding Common Shares, on a partially diluted basis and (b) the ability of the Oaktree Funds to purchase up to 3,000,000 Common Shares on the market or in private transactions within 12 months of the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Issuer.  The standstill continues until the later of (a) 24 months following the Closing Date and (b) 12 months following the later of the date on which (i) no Investor Nominee serves on the Board and (ii) the governance rights referred to above are terminated.  The Oaktree Funds have also agreed to a lock-up that prohibits them from selling Preferred Shares or Common Shares issuable upon exchange of the Preferred Shares prior to April 7, 2018, subject to certain exceptions.
 
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, the Oaktree Funds may request that the Issuer seek to obtain approval by the shareholders of the Issuer of a resolution to (i) remove the Beneficial Ownership Exchange Cap, (ii) remove the Voting Cap (as defined below under Special Voting Shares and Voting Trust Agreement) and (iii) waive the application of the Issuers shareholder rights plan to the acquisition by the Oaktree Funds of beneficial ownership of the Special Voting Shares and Common Shares issued on exchange of the Preferred Shares (collectively, the Shareholder Approval).
 
In connection with the designation of the Observer pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, on October 7, 2016, the Issuer also entered into a board observer and confidentiality agreement (the Observer Agreement) with the Observer providing for certain rights and obligations of the Observer as a non-voting observer of the Board.
 
This summary description of the Investor Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Investor Rights Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 5  and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Exchange and Support Agreement
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, the Issuer, SunOpta Foods and the Oaktree Funds entered into an exchange and support agreement dated October 7, 2016 (the Exchange and Support Agreement), providing for, among other things, the grant by the Issuer to each Holder, from time to time, of the right to exchange such Preferred Shares with the Issuer for Common Shares.
 
This summary description of the Exchange and Support Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exchange and Support Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 6 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Special Voting Shares and Voting Trust Agreement
 
On October 7, 2016, the Issuer filed Articles of Amendment to designate a series of special shares as Special Shares, Series 1 (the Special Voting Shares).  The Special Voting Shares entitle the holder thereof to one vote per Special Voting Share on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of Common Shares, together as a single class, subject to certain exceptions.
 
In connection with the Subscription Agreement, 11,333,333 Special Voting Shares were issued to and deposited with an affiliate of the Oaktree Funds (the Trustee), as trustee for and on behalf of the Oaktree Funds and their affiliates that may hold the Preferred Shares from time to time pursuant to a voting trust agreement dated October 7, 2016 (the Voting Trust Agreement) between the Issuer, SunOpta Foods, the Oaktree Funds and the Trustee.  Pursuant to the Voting Trust Agreement, additional Special Voting Shares will be issued, or existing Special Voting Shares shall be redeemed, as necessary to ensure that the aggregate number of Special Voting Shares outstanding is equal to the number of Preferred Shares outstanding from time to time multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing the Liquidation Preference at such time by the Exchange Price in effect at such time (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), subject to certain restrictions.
 
19





 
Pursuant to the Voting Trust Agreement, until the Shareholder Approval is obtained, the voting rights attached to the Special Voting Shares are also subject to the following restrictions:
 
(a)                                 the aggregate number of votes exercised by the Oaktree Funds in respect of the Special Voting Shares shall not exceed 17,130,757, being 19.99% of the outstanding Common Shares on the Closing Date (the Voting Cap), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances; and
 
(b)                                 the aggregate number of votes exercised by the Oaktree Funds in respect of the Special Voting Shares, shall not exceed the number of Common Shares that the Oaktree Funds would be entitled to receive upon exchange of its Preferred Shares in compliance with  the Beneficial Ownership Exchange Cap.
 
The Special Voting Shares are not transferable and the voting rights associated with the Special Voting Shares will terminate upon the transfer of the Preferred Shares to a third party, other than a controlled affiliate of the Oaktree Funds.
 
This summary description of the Special Voting Shares and the Voting Trust Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Articles of Amendment of the Issuer filed with this report as Exhibit 3 and the Voting Trust Agreement filed with this report as Exhibit 8, in each case incorporated herein by reference.

Mutual funds can help lower investing risks
Take some of the anxiety out of investing by letting a mutual fund do a little of the work for you.

Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Layer opened.Expense ratio







A mutual fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets. It's calculated annually and removed from the fund's earnings before they're distributed to investors, directly reducing investors' returns.An expense ratio includes management, administrative, marketing, and distribution fees. It doesn't include loads or purchase or redemption fees.

footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Fulfill important philanthropic commitments

We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
