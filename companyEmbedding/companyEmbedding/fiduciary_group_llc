1970
The firm is founded by Lee Butler. Lee had worked for many years in the trust department of a large bank, managing and administering families’ assets in order to protect them across generations.   He recognized the need for independence from banks, brokers, and financial products if he was going to serve as fiduciary advisor acting in the clients’ best interests.

Lee’s son, Malcolm, joined the company after graduating from Duke University.  Saving and investing was in Malcolm’s DNA, opening his first account when he was 12 years old.


1982
Seeing a need for greater expertise in estate and taxation matters, Malcolm entered the University of Georgia Law School.


1985
Malcolm returns to the firm after graduating with a law degree. By now, the firm’s clients were turning to Lee and Malcolm to do what has come to be known as "wealth management"—everything from investing assets and administering trusts and estates, to paying clients’ bills and overseeing family finances.

2012
Joel Goodman becomes an equity owner in the firm.  Scott McGhie becomes an equity partner a year later. 


2015
TFG enters into a strategic partnership with Focus Financial Partners LLC.Focus is the leading partnership of over 35 independent wealth management firms, all of which follow the fiduciary standard.  The Focus partnership positions the firm for future growth and multi-generational succession while allowing the firm’s management team independence and operational control.For more information about Focus and the Focus partner firms, visit www.FocusFinancialPartners.com.


2016
Starting from $40 million in assets under management and 3 employees in 1985, the firm has grown to 10 employees—seven investment professionals and three administrative staff—with assets under management exceeding $650 million.  The firm currently manages the investment assets for over 400 individuals, families,and trusts and over 35-company 401(k) plans, and also provides comprehensive fee-based financial planning.  The firm has truly evolved from a family-owned business to a world-class business serving families and businesses.

					Our Mission	







Our Mission










At The Fiduciary Group, our mission is to build, protect, and grow our clients’ wealth over the long-term through sound planning and disciplined investment management.  Our philosophy to building wealth is defined by three words which we have memorialized in our tagline:  Conserve Plan Grow®. 
The First Step – Conserve
Conservation is the first step to converting income into wealth that can last a lifetime and beyond. Preservation of wealth, once accumulated, is equally important.  An effective conservation plan changes as a person moves through life’s different stages: raising a family, saving for education, building a career, saving for retirement, preserving wealth in retirement, and providing a legacy.  At The Fiduciary Group, we have helped many others transition through similar stages of life.  Once we understand where you are and what you want to accomplish, we can provide helpful advice and a tailored investment strategy to conserve your wealth and achieve your goals.
The Second Step – Plan
Before we invest, we get to know you. We want to understand what’s important to you, how you think about investing, and what risks you seek to manage.  We then agree on an investment plan that addresses your objectives, and propose an investment strategy that addresses market risk and your special life circumstances.  Planning is not a one-off activity, but an ongoing process, and because of that, we meet regularly with you to review your portfolio and address the circumstances that may change over time.
For those who want a comprehensive, written financial plan we also offer a full suite of financial plans. These financial plans allow you to map and monitor specific financial goals such as saving for retirement, funding a child’s education, managing risk through insurance, determining appropriate withdrawal levels, and planning for one’s legacy. 
The Third Step – Grow
Once we have full knowledge of your financial needs and objectives, we then construct and manage a globally-diversified portfolio designed to achieve long-term growth and income while managing risk through a balanced strategy tailored to your needs. Our research is independent, our investment decisions are based solely on your best interests. Assets are held in custody primarily at Charles Schwab, a financially-strong independent custodian that provides asset protection protocols and independent reporting to safeguard your assets.

Welcome to Select Fiduciary Group LLC
Most of us don’t know we need the services of a private professional fiduciary until we are in crisis.  In fact, most people, if asked, couldn’t describe what a professional fiduciary does much less why they might need the services of one.  At Select Fiduciary Group, we provide peace of mind.  During your lifetime, we stand ready to step in and fill the void of managing your estate and providing for your personal needs including carrying out your expressed wishes related to health care and housing should you become incapacitated and unable to do so for yourself.  After you die, we serve as trustee of your trust and stand in your place to ensure that it is administered according to your instructions in the trust document.  If you have named a family member as successor trustee of your trust, we are also there to assist or relieve the designated trustee of their responsibilities and obligations should they become overwhelmed or find themselves conflicted in carrying out their dual roles as loving family member and trustee with all of the attendant administrative responsibilities.
At Select Fiduciary Group, we personalize and tailor our services to your specific needs rather than fitting you into a template as is often the case with institutional trustees. Give us the opportunity to serve you and you’ll discover why we’re the premier private professional fiduciary firm in California.



Services:

Private Trustee – including living or revocable trusts, irrevocable trusts (marital and bypass or exemption trusts), special needs trusts, charitable trusts and insurance trusts.
Agent Under a Durable Power of Attorney – including agent for finances and/or for health care

About 

About Us
Select Fiduciary Group LLC is a California limited liability company owned by Daniel J. Ansel and Ron Miller. Daniel and Ron are both California Licensed Professional Fiduciaries and National Certified Guardians. Select Fiduciary Group was formed to bring together the unparalleled combined expertise and experience of seasoned business professionals uniquely qualified to administer high net worth trust estates with complex or semi-illiquid assets that most corporate trusts cannot or choose not to administer. For very large estates with substantial liquid investments, we have entered into collaborative arrangements with certain corporate trust companies with strong balance sheets and the expertise to manage those assets. For more information on our principals, please see below:
Daniel J Ansel
Daniel J. Ansel is Co-Managing Principal of Select Fiduciary Group and has over 30 years of experience as an executive manager, entrepreneur, consultant and as a private trustee, agent under a durable power of attorney and administrator in probate.  He has worked for both public and private companies (including his own); predominantly in the real estate development, assisted living (for individuals with dementia) and healthcare industries.  He has served in the roles of CFO, COO, CEO and as Chief Restructuring Officer for financially distressed healthcare providers.
Read More
Earlier in his career, Daniel served as Director of Corporate Development for a large national architectural and engineering company where he consolidated insurance and employees benefits programs from multiple subsidiaries into a single company-wide program, created a common marketing identity and participated in the due diligence process for new acquisitions.
Daniel later joined a large national publicly owned developer of active adult retirement communities initially as Corporate Budget Director and eventually as Vice President of Finance and Administration of the company’s Southern California Division. He later was recruited to work as Vice President and Project Manager for another Southern California developer who wanted to get into to the retirement community market.
After five years in real estate development, Daniel joined up with a group of turnaround management professionals in the health care provider space where he became an expert in turning around financially distressed hospitals and nursing homes, completing a very successful bankruptcy turnaround of a publicly owned national nursing home company and the out-of-court restructuring of a large Southern California hospital system.
As a result of his experience with the nursing home business and a personal family experience with the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s Disease, Daniel started up a company where he developed and operated several specialized assisted living facilities in which he cared for elderly individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease or other forms of dementia. That experience has given him a deep appreciation for the hardships families face, both personally and financially, in dealing with this debilitating disease.
After experiencing a dramatic change in the assisted living business, Daniel and his partners decided to sell the business and he went back to working as a bankruptcy turnaround expert managing multi-million dollar budgets and helping companies to stabilize their finances and restructure their business operations, emerge from bankruptcy, and has adjudicated or settled and paid out more than $40 million in creditor claims over the course of his career. He is well respected for his integrity and ability to deal fairly and honestly with people.
After completing a hospital assignment in 2012, Daniel recognized that the number of turnaround opportunities was rapidly diminishing and having served for 6 years as trustee of a couple of family related trusts, he decided to pursue a career as a professional fiduciary. He earned his certificate in Professional Fiduciary Management for Trustees from California State University, Fullerton in 2013. He has served as a trustee of both living and irrevocable trusts for more than 9 years and in the capacity of agent under a durable power of attorney for both finances and health care for several years. He serves as a successor trustee for elderly individuals who have no family members to designate who are capable of serving as their successor trustee and has served as administrator in probate.
Daniel is uniquely qualified to work with clients whose estates include a family owned business or other significant business or real estate investments. His administrative experience and attention to detail make him ideally suited to manage estates of all sizes and levels of complexity.
Daniel holds a Master’s of Business Administration degree in finance from the Carlson School of Management, as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from the University of Minnesota. He is a member of the Orange County Estate Planning Council and Professional Fiduciary Association of California.


Ron Miller
Ron Miller is Co-Managing Principal of Select Fiduciary Group, Inc. and has over 30 years of experience serving as a corporate and private trustee, probate estate executor and administrator, conservator, and agent under a durable power of attorney for both finances and health care. He also serves as trustee for individuals who are unable to or do not wish to serve as their own trustee, as successor trustee for elderly individuals who have no one willing or able to serve as successor trustee and as conservator of estates and persons. He also serves as case manager for clients’ personal healthcare needs, including Alzheimer’s, dementia, memory loss, cancer, physical and mental impairments, and other complex health challenges.
Read More

Ron is respected by clients and peers for his deep fiduciary expertise, high level of integrity and ability to meet fiduciary responsibilities in an unbiased fashion. Ron is well qualified to work with clients who have a family-owned business, significant real estate holdings and other complex investments. His administrative experience and attention to detail make him ideally suited to manage trusts and estates of all sizes and levels of complexity.
During his career, Ron has served in a variety of roles related to trusts and estates. His formative experience as a trust officer at Bank of America included managing over $20 billion in equity, fixed-income and real estate assets under management and more than 400 trusts and estates ranging in size between $500,000 and $100 million. He also managed and supervised real estate acquisition, investment, finance, development, property management and disposition for hundreds of residential and commercial properties throughout the U.S., and investments in oil and gas, timber, minerals and mining, and various private and public business interests. During this time, in addition to managing the investment, accounting and client relationship management responsibilities, he also administered over 20 bankruptcy/workout situations, including numerous environmental remediation trusts, and was integral to the acquisition and integration of Sanwa Trust, Security Pacific Bank’s trust department, and the eventual divestiture of Bank of America’s trust department to First Bank System. Ron also has significant litigation support and conflict management experience, and an ability to help clients navigate stressful family dynamics.
Ron spent a number of years as a business management consultant serving Fortune 1000 clients and, later, an investment banker providing merger & acquisition, capital raise and strategy engagement services to companies in over 30 industries. Ron led and participated in over 80 engagements, including mergers, growth initiatives, acquisitions, capital spending analyses, restructurings, senior executive compensation studies and content-driven digital asset management, and he managed a small private equity fund investing in businesses in the technology and real estate industries.
Following this, he served as the Chief Financial Officer of a technology manufacturing company, where he was responsible for all strategic and financial management, accounting, SEC reporting and M&A activities. 
Ron later accepted an opportunity as division Chief Operating Officer with Mellon Financial Corporation’s trust and investment accounting division, where he served as a member of the senior management team that led a successful turnaround. He was instrumental in anticipating, evaluating, preparing for and implementing the Bank of New York acquisition.
Ron later accepted an opportunity as a Financial Advisor with Merrill Lynch, where he provided fiduciary investing and accounting, financial planning and business advisory services to business owners, executives, high net worth families and institutional clients. 
Ron is a California Licensed Professional Fiduciary and a National Certified Guardian. He earned his certificate in Professional Fiduciary Management from California State University-Fullerton.  He is a graduate of the University of Southern California and USC’s Marshall Business School, where he studied Electrical Engineering and Business Administration (Honors Corporate Finance and Investment Management).

Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

Financial AdvisorsServing Your Best Interest.




 Fiduciary Financial GroupInvestment Management & Financial PlanningFiduciary DutyAt Fiduciary Financial Group, we hold ourselves to the highest standard of professional ethics... the fiduciary standard of care. It's a simple concept yet absent in many client/advisor relationships: Only provide advice and recommendations that are in the best interests of the client. Always. No exceptions.CredentialsDon't let others fool you. Credentials matter. In a world where anyone can label themselves a "Financial Advisor, Financial Planner, Wealth Manager, Wealth Advisor, etc." we strive to achieve the most recognized and applicable professional designations for personal wealth management. Have satisfaction that you are working with people who have taken their profession seriously by educating themselves at the highest level.  The global markets change and we must change with them. We are serial learners striving to stay ahead of the curve and in the know. The best way to achieve this is through continuing education.Active CollaborationIn-depth financial planning involves reviewing not only a clients budget and investments, but also their estate plan, beneficiary designations, mortgage and business financing, insurance documents, tax returns, etc. Often, there are issues identified that must be addressed outside our realm of expertise. We invest a great deal of our time building relationships with local professionals whom we have vetted to be credible, technical, and to fill the gaps.

Areas of PracticeInvestment managementOur incentive is simple: grow your money as much as possible within the confines of your tolerance for risk. To that end, we remain detached and are not driven to solicit or promote any particular investment product. We focus on liquid & publicly traded investments including individual stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), exchange traded funds (ETF's), bonds, commodities, money market funds and other asset categories for our portfolio strategies.retirement PLAN consulting for business ownersThe world of retirement plan design, administration, and ongoing investment management oversight is complex. With our ability to speak the same accounting language as your bookkeepers, payroll, and tax professionals, we can serve as the quarterback  for your company retirement plan. We have strong relationships with local tax and bookkeeping professionals and a network of Third Party Pension Plan Consultants to provide an outstanding experience for the business owner and their employees.education planningCan I afford to send my child to college? What's a 529 plan? If I have more than one child, do I need multiple 529 plans? What's the best way to save for college? We hear these questions all the time. Through our comprehensive financial planning process, we can help guide you through all of the different strategies and help pick the right one.financial planningWe differentiate ourselves by offering specialized financial planning. With our accounting and tax backgrounds, our financial planning deliverable is as competitive (particularly in light of our reasonable fees) as any in the industry.  The key is coordination and collaboration. We work hand-in-hand with your tax, insurance, bookkeeping, and legal professionals to ensure your plan is a comprehensive and fluid document that can be re-visited as your circumstances change year to year. Planning services can be provided standalone in an hourly consultative capacity or as part of the investment advisory agreement.retirement planningWhen can I retire? How should I invest my 401k? Is my 401k invested properly? ROTH vs IRA? Do I have enough money? How much should I be saving for retirement? When should I start receiving social security? Should I sell my house? Can I afford to live in a retirement home? These are great questions we can help answer through our in-depth financial planning process.strategic philanthropyThrough our strategic partnership with Cogeo and vast network of estate planning attorneys and tax professionals, we provide expertise on maximizing your charitable intent through strategic philanthropy. Planned giving vehicles such as gifts of life insurance, donor advised funds, charitable remainder and lead trusts, and charitable gift annuities should be considered. To understand what vehicle to best leverage, get in touch with either Richard or Trevor. 

It’s not how much money you make, but how much money you keep, how hard it works for you, and how many generations you keep it for.

We centered our name around the word “fiduciary” because it gets to the heart of what we do and how we do it. It means that our allegiance flows in one direction: to the needs and best interests of each client. As fiduciary advisors, we have no ties to banks, brokers or other entities that could divide our loyalties. We sell no products and receive no commissions or financial incentives that could influence our recommendations.

Services

Fiduciary investment management is at the heart of what we do for all clients— whether high-net worth individuals and families, trusts and estates, or 401(k) plans.  Building upon our core competencies in research, due diligence, investment selection, asset allocation, and portfolio construction, we have developed three main lines of service offerings:
Wealth Management for high-net worth individuals and families;
Section 3(38) Fiduciary Investment Management for 401(k) Plan Sponsors and Participants;
Trust and Estate Administration to ensure proper management and distribution of assets across generations.
We invite you to learn more about each of these services and how they help our clients build, protect, and grow their wealth for their lifetimes and beyond.




Wealth Management

Our mission is simple: Conserve Plan Grow®.  Over 400 individuals and families entrust us to do just that – to build, protect, and grow their wealth.
The Fiduciary Group’s wealth management services are built first and foremost on fiduciary investment management. We start by listening. We seek to understand our clients’ goals and needs for the short and long term. We get to know our clients and their families.  We then determine an appropriate investment strategy and follow a disciplined process to help our clients achieve investment returns in line with their time horizon, objectives, tolerance for risk. Read More



401(k) Investment Management

We have created a better way for employees to save and invest for retirement. It’s a different kind of 401(k) platform, built out of our own need to have an excellent 401(k) offering for our own employees, and from the perspective of the best interests of participants. The platform is designed to achieve two main things:
Help participants achieve greater success in retirement savings and investment outcomes.
Greatly reduce or eliminate the plan sponsor’s fiduciary liability. Read More



Trust & Estate Administration

If you have significant financial assets, it’s never too early to start planning how they will be managed and distributed after you’re gone. Having administered trust assets for over 45 years, we know how to steward assets effectively across generational lines. Developing and setting a plan in place as early as possible makes dealing with the transition much easier for all involved.
Whether you have a will you want to execute or wish to set up a trust or endowment that will long outlive you, we are ready to work and ensure your intentions are honored. Read More

I attended an investment conference recently and one of the speakers was Stephen
Friedman, former Chairman of Goldman Sachs. During his
fireside chat, he mentioned that when it comes to investing,
he follows some basic rules of risk management. He said that these rules were
universal truths that grandparents have shared with their grandchildren over multiple generations.

As part of our job as investment managers,
we read numerous shareholder letters every
year. Occasionally, these letters offer a unique
perspective or insight that renews our enthusiasm for
how we think about businesses and the art of long-term
investing. The most recent letter from Amazon CEO Jeff
Bezos is a gem that has kept our attention since it was
published in April.

The Graduates’ Trillion Dollar Problem





Ernesto Montes
Associate Investment Advisor

Over the past few decades, student debt has transformed from a tool for accessing higher education to a significant obstacle preventing young people from accumulating wealth and saving towards retirement. According to a February 2017 report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan balances increased by $31 billion in 2016.

How Investing Transformed Over the Century





Malcolm Butler, JD
President

I recently read a book on the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. The author thoroughly details the lives of some of the affluent passengers who were aboard the luxury liner’s final voyage. As I was learning about these “high net worth” people who lived one hundred years ago, I kept wondering about how they saved and invested, and how early 20th century investing contrasts with early 21st century investing.

In the fourth-quarter newsletter, we discussed how we think about long-term equity return expectations. The purpose of the article was to explain how fundamental returns (driven by earnings growth) and speculative returns (driven by changes in valuation) collectively impact market prices. While changes in valuation are the overwhelming driver of equity returns in the short run, earnings growth (a proxy for intrinsic value) is what truly matters over the long-term.

Countering Volatility with Counterintuitive Action





Julia Butler, CFP®, JD, MBA
Chief Operating & Compliance Officer and Director of 401(k) Advisory & Financial Planning Services

My mom asked me once how I swallowed pills. “Show me,” she said. I went through the motions of pretending to put a pill in my mouth, mimed the act of taking a sip of water, then leaned my head back and swallowed. “That’s exactly the opposite of what you should do,” she said. “Instead of leaning your head back, you should take a sip of water, tilt your chin forward, then swallow.”

Have we seen the beginning of the Great Rotation?





Malcolm Butler, JD
President

"A blue-chip stock is the stock of a large, well-established and financially sound company that has operated for many years. A blue-chip stock typically has a market capitalization in the billions, is generally the market leader or among the top three companies in its sector, and is more often than not a household name.

Your Success Is Our Goal.
Our mission is simple: Conserve Plan Grow®.  Over 400 individuals and families entrust us to do just that – to build, protect, and grow their wealth.
The Fiduciary Group’s wealth management services are built first and foremost on fiduciary investment management. We start by listening. We listen to our clients’ goals and needs for the short and long term. We then determine the right investment strategy and follow a disciplined investment process to help our clients achieve annualized investment returns in line with their time horizon, objectives, and tolerance for risk.
At The Fiduciary Group, wealth management often involves much more than investment management.  It may include advice on a myriad of household budgeting, risk management, and purchasing decisions.  It might involve comprehensive financial planning and collaboration with our clients’ accountants, lawyers, and insurance agents.  Sometimes it extends to advice on the sale of a business or monetizing stock options.
It may include paying our clients’ bills and estimated taxes and managing their checkbook, or acting as a power of attorney on their behalf to execute and report on a range of financial transactions. Often, it extends to estate planning and the administration of our clients’ trusts and estates to carry out their legacies and manage their wealth across generations.
We’ll guide you to make wise, sustainable choices and avoid unnecessary risks. We'll help you set clear expectations and map a course to meet them. Our goal is to preserve and build your wealth while managing risk – to support your lifestyle and provide your legacy.

Investment Management
Investment management is one of our fundamental core competencies, and one in which we invest heavily in terms of intellectual capital, data sources, systems, and processes.  Our experience and expertise extends to: investment strategy and asset allocation; research, analysis, and selection of investments (individual stocks and bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs); construction, monitoring, and management of investment portfolios; and ongoing client review and engagement. We follow a disciplined Investment Process.
To achieve our clients’ objectives, we stand by our investment management philosophy and these fundamental principles:
Focus on Clients’ Needs and Goals:  Investment management begins with a thorough discussion to understand our clients’ financial objectives so that we can devise the right investment strategy and provide financial advice that is helpful and relevant.
Long-Term Perspective:  We approach portfolio management as long-term investors, patiently seeking to build wealth over time while managing risk.
Diversification and Asset Allocation:  We believe in constructing globally-diversified portfolios appropriately allocated among asset classes and in line with our clients’ objectives, time horizon, risk tolerance, and unique circumstances.
Independence and Objectivity:  Our research is independent and incorporates multiple sources of financial, market, and economic intelligence.
Transparency and Liquidity:  We invest in individual equity and fixed income securities, mutual funds, and ETFs.  All positions are publicly-traded, daily valued, highly-liquid, and transparent.
Client Assets and Best Execution: Assets are held in custody primarily at Charles Schwab, a financially-strong custodian that provides industry-leading asset protection protocols.  Schwab provides independent reporting to clients of all positions, valuations, and transactions.  Schwab also provides best execution of trades.
Ongoing Client Communication:  We believe maintaining regularly scheduled communications with our clients strengthens client relationships and positively impacts our investment strategy.


Financial Planning
Planning to Achieve Your Financial Goals
We offer a broad selection of professionally prepared financial plans that allow our clients to monitor their progress toward specific financial goals: saving for retirement, saving for college, or managing lifetime savings for retirement and beyond.
At The Fiduciary Group, our plans have two objectives: (1) to provide a clear, objective view of your current financial situation as it relates to your goals; and (2) to help you understand and monitor the variables that may impact specific goals or risks.  We believe our approach to planning offers a number of benefits:
Independent and Objective
Our plans are fee-based and transparent. We prepare the plan as your fiduciary, meaning we render objective advice based solely on our clients' best interests. We do not receive a commission or financial incentive of any kind for selling insurance, annuities, or other financial products.
Dynamic and Accessible
Our plans are dynamic and accessible online through our password protected client portal, allowing each client to monitor and modify their plan as circumstances change.  Clients can even test variables to simulate a fluctuating market and its potential impact on specific goals.
Focused on What’s Important to You
Depending on your financial life-stage and specific circumstances, you may have different financial priorities and concerns. We offer “planning modules” that focus on particular needs you would like to address. You can choose to focus on an individual module, combine modules that matter most to you, or take a comprehensive approach to your planning needs.





Financial Concierge Services
We provide a broad array of financial concierge services, which can be tailored to the needs of our clients.  A number of our clients nominate our principals to serve as Power of Attorney to handle various household financial transactions such as distributions, transfers, and withdrawals.  For some, we provide bookkeeping services to track income and disbursements for business or family partnerships, as well as principal and interest payments for loans.  
As clients age, many look to our bill pay service to issue payment on their behalf for bills, specific taxes, and household expenses.   Our client account administrators maintain complete, detailed records of all payments and transactions. We can also send statements to an interested party, such as a family member or accountant, to monitor expenses.
We provide year-end transaction reporting to clients and their CPAs for tax purposes.  We also can provide consolidated reporting of held-away assets and non-managed assets (real estate, life insurance) so that clients have a holistic view of their assets and their values.
Fees for bill pay and other financial concierge services are based on the level of service to be provided.
