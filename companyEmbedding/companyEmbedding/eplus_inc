Customer Terms and Conditions for Products and/or Services

1. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS VERY CAREFULLY. The customer (“Customer”) and ePlus Technology, inc. (“ePlus”) hereby agree to the following terms and conditions, which will be incorporated by reference into any contract for provision of product and/or service by ePlus. These Terms and Conditions (these “Terms”) represent the complete and final agreement between the customer and ePlus for the matters set forth herein. By placing an order with ePlus or an ePlus affiliate for products or services Customer agrees to be bound by and accepts these Terms unless Customer and ePlus have entered into a separate written agreement signed by a senior corporate officer of ePlus (a “Written Contract”), in which case the Written Contract will govern. Customer may issue an ordering document or purchase order for administrative purposes only. Additional or different terms contained in any such purchase order will be null and void. Terms contained in purchase orders, offers to buy, terms and conditions, and the like shall have no effect; any additional or different terms or conditions in any form delivered by Customer are hereby deemed to be material alternations and notice of objection to them and rejection of them is hereby given. In no event shall ePlus’ performance under a purchase order, statement of work or similar instrument be deemed to constitute acceptance of any terms and conditions other than as set forth herein. ANY DESCRIPTION OF THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND RESULT THEREOF POSTED ON THE EPLUS WEB SITE DO NOT CONSTITUTE PART OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EPLUS AND CUSTOMER. 
2.Orders. Orders are not binding until accepted by ePlus. As order delivery times are estimates only, ePlus is not liable for any delays that are beyond its control. Approvals for order cancellations, suspensions or alterations are subject to manufacturer policies and guidelines and ePlus’ ability, pursuant to those policies and guidelines, to cancel/suspend orders to its suppliers. Prior to the shipment, except for products that have been irreversibly configured or customized, customer may cancel, suspend or alter all or a portion of an order. An alteration includes: (i) changing a location for delivery, (ii) modifying the quantity of the product to be delivered, (iii) changing the requested delivery date, or (iv) correcting any typographical or clerical errors. 
3.Pricing. Prices for products and services shall be as identified in an order accepted by ePlus. ePlus strives to provide its customers with pricing that is competitive based on the circumstances at the time that an order is placed. However pricing is subject to variation based on manufacturer discounts and price list changes, order volume, specific services and personnel provided, the circumstances and needs of each customer, and other factors. EPLUS CANNOT AND DOES NOT MAKE GUARANTEES REGARDING THE PRICING OR RELATED TERMS APPLICABLE TO AN ORDER. NO COMPARATIVE PRICE GUARANTY, PRICE WARRANTY, “MOST FAVORED CUSTOMER” PROVISION OR SIMILAR PRICING COMMITMENT SHALL APPLY TO ORDERS ACCEPTED BY EPLUS, AND ANY SUCH TERMS THAT MAY BE SET FORTH IN A PURCHASE ORDER OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENT ARE HEREBY REJECTED. 
4.Title, Ownership and Inspection. Title to product is retained by ePlus until the product is paid for in full by the customer. Subject to full and final payment and except for any confidential or proprietary materials in which ePlus or its supplier(s) has a pre-existing intellectual property interest (“Existing Materials”), any and all deliverables provided as a result of the performance of services (the “Work Product”), shall be deemed to be a “work for hire”. To the extent that Existing Materials are incorporated in Work Products, ePlus grants to customer and its Affiliates a royalty-free, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual right to use, modify and prepare derivative works of such Existing Materials and to use and display such Existing Materials, with full rights to authorize others to do the same but subject to any supplier restrictions and only to the extent required to utilize the Work Product in accordance with the ownership rights granted in this Agreement. Loss or damage that occurs during shipping by a carrier selected by ePlus shall be ePlus’ sole responsibility; loss or damage that occurs during shipping by a carrier selected by customer shall be customer’s sole responsibility. If damaged products are accepted from the carrier, such damage should be noted on the carrier delivery record. Customer should save the product and the original box/packaging and notify ePlus to arrange for a carrier inspection and a pickup of damaged products. Please notify your account executive of any damaged shipping containers within the first two (2) days of receipt. Two (2) days is considered a reasonable period of time to conduct the visual inspection of the shipping container, and failure to provide such notice will constitute acceptance in full. Customer also shall notify ePlus of any order shortages or any concealed damages within seven (7) business days. These notification timeframes are necessary so that ePlus may assist customer on a timely basis in obtaining the benefit of any manufacturer warranties as well as filing any shipping claims with the carrier, as applicable. 
5.Payment. Unless otherwise agreed to in a Written Contract, payment terms are net 30 from date of invoice. Customer shall bear applicable federal, state, municipal and other government taxes (such as sales, use and similar taxes). Unless specified, prices do not include tax, shipping or handling. Tax exemption certificates must be supplied prior to shipment if they are to be honored. Late payment charges of 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowed by law (whichever is less), will apply to any amount not received by the due date. In the event ePlus must resort to collection, customer will be responsible for all collections costs, including legal fees. If the "Bill To" party is different from the "Ship To" party, the "Ship To" party is responsible for all payments and late charges if the "Bill To" party fails to make payment. In any case where Customer receives products or services but the purchase authorization is provided from a third party to be billed pursuant to a lease or financing arrangement, payment of the invoice will be Customer’s responsibility in the event such third party fails to make timely payment. . Any communications concerning disputed debts, including any instrument tendered as full satisfaction of the disputed debt, are to be sent to the Office of General Counsel, ePlus Technology, inc., 13595 Dulles Technology Drive, Herndon, VA 20171. 
6.Product Returns. Approvals for unused, unopened returns are subject to manufacturer return policies and guidelines and ePlus’ ability to return product to its vendors. Such products must be complete and in manufacturer’s original packaging, with no visible damage. ePlus will not be required to accept any return of sold products without an approved return merchandise authorization (“RMA”) number, which may be obtained by contacting the customer’s account executive. A RMA is valid for ten (10) days from the ePlus issuance date, unless other arrangements are made between the parties at the time of ePlus’ RMA approval. The ePlus RMA number is to be clearly noted on a shipping label affixed to the outer shipping box and any items received into an ePlus return facility without an RMA number or after the elapsed time period will be sent back to the customer at the customer’s expense, unless otherwise agreed to under a Written Contract. Any writing, markings or stickers, except shipping label, on the box will void any authorized return. Except in the event of an ePlus or vendor error, customer will be responsible for shipping charges associated with any products being shipped for return, exchange or replacement. Products exchanged or replaced will be shipped back to customer, at customer’s expense. Returns must be made via an authorized carrier that allows the package to be tracked, and customer must insure all returned products. Products not eligible for return include, but are not limited to, items that were at end-of-life cycle at the time of order, used or opened software, used consumables, custom configured and built to order products, and products not purchased through ePlus. At ePlus’ discretion, restocking fees may be charged for items which do not qualify for return under this policy. Some manufacturers require that defective or Dead on Arrival (DOA) products be returned directly to them, or they may limit the timeframe in which products can be returned; therefore, products that are inoperable at initial use may be eligible for DOA return to or replacement by the manufacturer, subject to the manufacturer’s product defective/DOA return policies. If the product is not returnable under manufacturer guidelines, ePlus will make every attempt to repair or replace the product through the manufacturer’s warranty. Customer should contact its ePlus account executive for further details on the manufacturer warranties. ePlus technicians test products returned as DOA or defective. Products found not to be defective may be subject to return at the customer’s expense. In any event, ePlus will work with its vendors to facilitate returns for the customer. 
7.Services. Services provided by ePlus or its subcontractor shall be pursuant to an applicable statement of work executed by the ePlus and Customer.

Certain services including, but not limited to maintenance, support, extended manufacturer warranty service, and other services provided under a manufacturer’s SKU identified in a purchase order, are sold by ePlus as a reseller without a statement of work. ("Third Party Services"). For such Third Party Services, the third party service provider shall be solely responsible for providing the services to the Customer, and Customer will look exclusively to such third party for any loss, claims, liability or damages arising from or related to the provision of such Third Party Services. Customer hereby releases ePlus and each of its affiliates from any and all claims arising from or relating to the purchase, sale or performance of any such Third Parties Services.

No statement or affirmation by ePlus or its agents, by action or word, shall constitute a warranty and Customer agrees torely solely on the manufacturers’ warranties. ePlus will not be liable for any damage, loss, cost or expense for breach of warranty. As ePlus has no control over the manufacturing of the products sold herein, it cannot and does not indemnify customer for claims by third parties that products infringe any patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret; however, ePlus will pass through any such indemnities it receives from the manufacturer or supplier.

Products are purchased upon Customer’s issuance of a Purchase Order, subject to acceptance by IGX.  The Purchase Order shall constitute an offer by Customer to purchase Products on the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Acceptance may be given either in writing (including email), or by IGX’s performance, such as procuring the Products, arranging for shipment, and/or invoicing.  All references herein to IGX or Customer, as the case may be, shall refer to an Affiliate of such Party to the extent such Affiliate issues or accepts a Purchase Order, in which case a contract is formed between such Affiliate and the other Party (or its Affiliate) subject to these Terms.  A Purchase Order must include (a) location where the Products are to be delivered and any special delivery instructions; (b) description of the Products, including quantity and Product numbers; (c) manufacturer or third party maintenance and support for equipment and programs, if applicable; (d) any installation or other professional services to be provided by IGX pursuant to a related SOW; (e) name and address of the Customer contact person for billing and name of the entity to be billed; (f) desired delivery date for the Products; and (g) any other special terms and conditions; provided, however, that such special terms and conditions do not conflict with this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the Purchase Order and this Agreement, the provisions of Section 14.A shall apply.
     

Customer agrees to abide by all product licensing provisions or end user agreements imposed by the manufacturer or software publisher.  Customer shall not reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise reduce to human perceivable form or attempt to discover the source code for the computer software (except as may be allowed by any applicable law which is incapable of exclusion by agreement between the Parties) or remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in the software.  Customer represents and warrants that any Products purchased according to the terms of this Agreement are for Customer’s internal use only and are not for resale or further distribution.  Customer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless IGX from and against any and all third party claims, liabilities, costs and expenses relating to or arising from a breach of this Section 2.B by Customer.
     

Cancellations or partial cancellations of orders for Products or Services require written confirmation from IGX.  All cancellations are subject to manufacturer policies and guidelines and IGX’s ability, pursuant to those policies and guidelines, to cancel orders to its manufacturers.  Customer is responsible for all liabilities, costs, expense, damage and loss suffered, incurred or paid by IGX related to cancellations by Customer.
     

IGX shall use reasonable commercial efforts to meet any delivery dates specified in the Purchase Order, but any such dates shall be estimates only and time shall not be of the essence for delivery of Products.  Shipment shall be Ex Works.  Customer shall be responsible for and pay all shipping, freight, and insurance charges unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, as well as any taxes, levies, duties or similar charges.
     

Title to Products shall pass to Customer on receipt by IGX of Customer’s payment in full in cleared funds of all sums due to IGX in relation to the Product(s) which are the subject of the Purchase Order and any other Product(s) and/or Services IGX has supplied to Customer in respect of which payment has become due.  Until title to the Product(s) passes to Customer: (i) Customer may use the Product(s) in the ordinary course of its business; (ii) Customer shall store the Product(s) separately from other goods held by Customer, maintain such Products in satisfactory condition, keep them insured against all risks for their full price from the time of delivery, notify IGX immediately if Customer suffers an Insolvency Event and provide IGX with such information concerning the Product(s) as IGX may request from time to time; (iii) if Customer suffers an Insolvency Event, then without prejudice to any other rights IGX may have, IGX may at any time require Customer to deliver up the Product(s) and, if Customer fails to do so promptly, enter any premises of Customer or any third party where such Product(s) are stored in order to recover them.        
     

Except for damaged packaging upon visual inspection, Customer shall not refuse delivery of Product shipments and, in the case where a Product shipment has been refused, IGX reserves the right to charge handling and restocking fees.  If damaged Products are accepted from the carrier, such damage should be noted on the carrier delivery record.  Customer should save the Product and original packaging and notify IGX to arrange for carrier inspection and pickup of damaged Products. Customer shall notify its designated account executive of any damaged shipping containers within two (2) days of receipt.  The Parties agree that two (2) days is a reasonable period of time to allow for visual inspection of the container, and Customer’s failure to provide such notice within that period shall constitute acceptance.  Customer also shall notify IGX of order shortages or concealed damages within seven (7) business days of delivery.  These timeframes are necessary for IGX to be able to provide timely assistance to Customer in obtaining the benefit of any manufacturer warranties as well as filing shipping claims.
     

Customer shall be responsible, at its own expense, for preparing prior to delivery a suitable installation site.  Unless otherwise specified, Customer shall be responsible for installing and connecting the Products within Customer’s environment compatible to manufacturer’s specifications provided by IGX to Customer.
     

Approvals for unused, unopened returns are subject to manufacturer return policies and guidelines and IGX’s ability to return Product to its vendors.  Such Products must be complete and in manufacturer’s original packaging with no visible damage.  IGX shall not be required to accept return of a Product without an approved return merchandise authorization (“RMA”) number, which may be obtained by contacting the Customer’s designated account executive. An RMA number is valid for (10) days from issuance, unless other arrangements are made between the Parties, and any items received at an IGX return facility without an RMA number or after the RMA validity period will be sent back to Customer at Customer’s expense.  The RMA number is to be clearly noted on a shipping label affixed to the outer shipping box.  Writing, markings or stickers, except shipping labels, on the manufacturer box will void an authorized return.  Except in the event of an IGX or vendor error, Customer will be responsible for shipping charges associated with Products being shipped for return, exchange or replacement.  Returns must be made via an authorized shipping carrier that allows the package to be tracked and Customer must insure all returned Products.  Products not eligible for return include, but are not limited to, items that were at end-of-life cycle at the time of order, used or opened software, used consumables, custom configured and built to order Products, and Products not purchased through IGX.  At IGX’s discretion, restocking fees may be charged for items which do not qualify for return under this policy.  Some manufacturers require that defective or “dead on arrival” Products be returned directly to them, or they may limit the return timeframe. Products found not to be defective after testing by IGX or manufacturer technicians may be subject to return at Customer’s expense.  If a Product is not returnable under manufacturer guidelines, IGX will make commercially reasonable attempts to repair or replace the Product through the manufacturer warranty.  Customer should contact its designated IGX account executive for further manufacturer warranty details. In any event, IGX will work with its vendors to facilitate returns for the Customer.
     

If Customer receives a Product solely for evaluation purposes in accordance with an IGX quotation and applicable manufacturer authorizations, Customer may elect to purchase such Product at the end of the evaluation period identified on the quotation or otherwise in writing by IGX (the “Evaluation Period”).  If Customer elects not to purchase the Product, Customer shall, on or before the end of the Evaluation Period, (i) in the case of software, either delete the software and return all originally accompanying materials or, (ii) in the case of hardware, request and obtain from IGX an RMA number for such Product; pack the Product and all originally accompanying materials in the original IGX containers; and return the Product to IGX or its designate, F.O.B. destination with RMA referenced, in the same condition as originally delivered to Customer. Customer shall be responsible for shipping and insurance charges.  Products not returned as specified above by the end of the Evaluation Period shall be deemed to have been purchased by Customer at IGX’s then current list price and payment shall be due in accordance with this Agreement.


3. PURCHASE OF SERVICES.
 

Customer may, from time to time, purchase IGX’s Services pursuant to a mutually acceptable SOW. The SOW shall constitute an offer by Customer to purchase Services. The SOW shall only be deemed to be accepted by IGX, when IGX issues written acceptance of the SOW, at which point and on which date a contract between the Parties in respect of the Services ordered shall come into existence on and subject to the terms and conditions of the SOW and this Agreement.  The sole authority to commence effort by IGX or to obligate payment by Customer in respect of the Services shall be a written SOW executed by both Parties.  In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of the SOW and this Agreement, the provisions of Section 14.A shall apply.
     

Customer acknowledges that in order for IGX to perform Services, Customer may need to make certain personnel or other resources available to IGX in a timely manner.  Customer agrees that it will cooperate in providing information or personnel upon IGX’s request, and Customer acknowledges that its failure to do so may prevent IGX from meeting milestones under a SOW.  IGX shall use reasonable commercial efforts to meet any performance dates specified in the SOW, but any such dates shall be estimates only and time shall not be of the essence for performance of the Services.  IGX shall not be liable for any failure to perform the Services to the extent such failure is caused by Customer’s lack of cooperation or other neglect or default in relation to the Services.   
     

Customer is responsible for all content, material, message or data made available or transmitted in accordance with the provision of Services and for its compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, ordinances and codes and acceptable use policies of any third-party vendors or websites.  In the event that Customer provides IGX with access to computer programs, specifications, content or other Customer-provided materials (“Customer Materials”), Customer represents and warrants to IGX that it owns or is duly authorized to grant such access to the Customer Materials. The Customer shall have sole responsibility for the legality, reliability, integrity, accuracy and quality of the Customer Materials. In particular, if the access to and/or use of the Customer Materials by IGX in performing the Services constitutes the processing of personal data (within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998 as amended or replaced), Customer and IGX acknowledge and agree that: (i) IGX shall process such personal data as a data processor and Customer shall be the data controller and retain sole responsibility for obtaining the consent of the relevant data subjects to the processing of the personal data by IGX and for the security of such personal data; (ii) IGX shall process any personal data under this Agreement or a SOW only in accordance with Customer’s instructions; and (iii) any personal data processed by IGX under this Agreement or a SOW may be transferred or stored outside the EEA or the country where Customer is located in order for IGX to carry out the Services and its other obligations under this Agreement.    
     

IGX, in performing the Services, will be making recommendations and providing advice, but all decisions as to implementing such advice and recommendations shall be made by and shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer and IGX shall be entitled to rely on all such decisions of Customer.  IGX is providing Services to assist Customer in support of the initiatives and activities described in the SOW and shall not assume any cost or schedule liability unless expressly agreed.  Customer is the governing authority of all activities and project directives and retains full responsibility for the leadership, review, and approval of actions taken and deliverables completed by IGX in support of Customer. 
     

IGX’s managed services solutions may be purchased pursuant to a separate master managed services agreement executed by the Parties. Manufacturer maintenance, support and similar third party services that are purchased from IGX as a reseller (and not pursuant to an IGX SOW) are subject to the terms of this Agreement applicable to Products.


4. PRICING AND PAYMENT.PRICING AND PAYMENT.
 

Pricing and Payment Terms.  The pricing for each order shall be as set forth on the applicable Purchase Order.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing for a particular order, IGX will invoice (i) for Products upon shipment without regard to any related Services, and (ii) for Services upon completion of such Services or of an applicable milestone under a SOW, and Customer shall be obliged to pay such invoice(s).  Payments shall be due net thirty (30) days from the date of IGX’s invoice and shall be made in Pounds Sterling by (1) cheque drawn on a UK bank; or (2) bank transfer or automated clearing house (ACH) transfer to an account specified by IGX.  Customer shall bear all related bank fees and charges.  Customer acknowledges that IGX may participate in and retain the benefit of vendor incentive plans, rebate programs, or other programs with, among others, its travel providers wherein IGX may receive benefits, such as frequent flier miles or other consideration. If Customer does not indicate for which item of equipment to apply payment, IGX reserves the right to apply payments to customer’s balance at its discretion. All amounts due under this Agreement shall be paid in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding (other than any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law). If any deduction or withholding is required by law Customer shall pay to IGX such sum as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave IGX with the same amount as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction or withholding. If Customer is required by law to make a deduction or withholding, Customer shall, within seven (7) days of making the deduction or withholding, provide a statement in writing showing the gross amount of the payment, the amount of the sum deducted and the actual amount paid.
     

Expense Reimbursement.  Whenever Services are provided by IGX at a location requested by Customer other than at an IGX location, IGX shall be reimbursed for all actual and reasonable travel and living expenses (“Expenses”) provided such Expenses are in accordance with a standard reimbursement policy, the terms of which are set forth as follows:
     
(i)    Fees for out-of-pocket expenses will be invoiced to Customer on a monthly basis.
(ii)   Itemization is required for all expenses.
(iii)  Time for travel under 50 miles will not be billable.
(iv)  The following guidelines shall apply for out-of-pocket expenses:
•   Lodging:  For less than one month, a single hotel room at prevailing commercial rates within a reasonable distance from job location.
•   Meals:  Actual cost not to exceed forty Pounds Sterling (£40) per day.
•   Air Travel: Actual cost for commercial coach or economy class.
•   Ground Transportation:  Commercial shuttle services or hotel transportation to and from the airport should be used whenever practicable.  Taxi service will only be used if such transportation is not available or in emergencies.
•   Auto Rental: Actual cost for commercial standard size automobile, including operating expenses.  
 

Taxes.IGX will furnish Customer with invoices showing separately itemized amounts due in respect of any and all sales, use, excise, value added, or similar taxes associated with the purchase of Products or Services, under applicable law (however, specifically excluding taxes on IGX’s net income) (“Taxes”), if any, or, in lieu thereof, Customer shall provide IGX with a tax exemption certificate acceptable to the applicable taxing authorities. Tax exemption certificates must be furnished to IGX prior to Product shipment or commencement of Services.  Otherwise Customer shall pay or reimburse IGX for all Taxes due under this Agreement and IGX shall remit those amounts to the appropriate taxing authority.  All persons furnished by IGX shall be considered solely employees of IGX, and IGX is responsible for compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations relating to employment of labor, working hours and conditions, payment of wages and employment, National Insurance and other payroll taxes including contributions from such employees when required by law.
     

Late Payments.  If Customer fails to make any payment due to IGX under this Agreement or any SOW by the due date for payment, then, without limiting IGX’s remedies under Section 13, Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of one percent (1%) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 if less.  Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.  In the event IGX must resort to collection, Customer shall be responsible for all costs including legal fees.  IGX reserves its right to review and revise either the credit or the payment terms based on Customer’s financial condition or payment history at the time of such review, and Customer agrees to provide all relevant information.  IGX may suspend Services or stop filling Product orders in the event of nonpayment. 
     

Third Party Financing Arrangements.  If the “Bill To” party on a Purchase Order is different from the “Ship To” party, Customer shall be responsible for all payments and late fees if the “Bill To” Party fails to make payment.  In any case where Customer receives Products or Services but the purchase authorisation is provided from a third party to be billed pursuant to a lease or financing arrangement, payment of the invoice is Customer’s responsibility in the event such third party fails to make timely payment.
     

Communications.  Any communications concerning disputed debts, including any instrument tendered as full satisfaction of the disputed debt, should be sent to IGX and copied to the General Counsel, ePlus Technology, inc., in accordance with Section 11.
     

Installment Payments. If IGX agrees to furnish Products or Services that require multiple payments or any payment to be made more than ninety (90) days from the date of the initial invoice (such as a multi-year maintenance contract with scheduled annual payments), then the following applies: 

The obligation to make the payments is non-cancelable and may not be terminated early. Customer agrees that its payment obligations to IGX are absolute and unconditional in all events.
Customer shall be in default upon failure to pay any sum within five (5) days of the due date, or failure to perform or observe any other obligation. If Customer defaults, IGX may do any or all of the following: (A) terminate this Agreement for material breach, (B) require Customer to stop using and return to IGX the Products or Services, (C) require Customer to pay to IGX on demand an amount equal to the sum of (1) all payments and other amounts then due and past due, (2) all remaining payments for the remaining term discounted at a rate of 2% per annum, (3) interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the amounts specified in Sub-sections (1) and (2) above until the date paid, and (4) all other amounts that may later become due in connection with the applicable Products or Services, and/or (D) exercise any other remedy available to IGX or its assignee under law.



5. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS.
 

“Confidential Information” means the terms of this Agreement together with all data, reports, analyses, compilations, records, pricing and evaluation of all or any portion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that Confidential Information must be marked with an appropriate legend or, if not in written or tangible form, identified as confidential at the time of disclosure and summarized and delivered to the other Party within three (3) days following disclosure. 
     

Notwithstanding any expiration of this Agreement or its termination for any reason, each Party shall protect the Confidential Information of the other Party from unauthorized disclosure to any third party until three (3) years from the date of its receipt.  Information about Customer's needs may be disclosed by IGX to applicable manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers as required for IGX to receive discounts, commissions, rebates, or other consideration pursuant to agreements with its vendors.

D.    Confidential Information shall remain the exclusive property of the disclosing Party and shall be returned to the disclosing Party promptly upon request except for electronic copies maintained in a secure location in accordance with the receiving Party’s standard electronic backup procedures.
 
E.    Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it would be difficult to fully compensate the other Party for damages resulting from the breach or threatened breach of the foregoing provisions and, accordingly, the non-breaching Party may seek temporary and injunctive relief, including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent injunctions to enforce such provisions.  This provision with respect to injunctive relief shall not, however, diminish a Party’s right to claim and recover damages.
6. OWNERSHIP OF WORK PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF SERVICES.
 
A.    Subject to full and final payment by Customer of all sums due to IGX, and except for any confidential or proprietary materials in which IGX or its suppliers have a pre-existing intellectual property interest (“Existing Materials”), any and all analyses, evaluations, reports, memoranda, letters, processes, methods, programs, and manuals and any improvements, enhancements, or modifications to any of the foregoing, which are developed, prepared or conceived by IGX specifically for Customer in the performance of Services (“Work Product”), shall be  and remain the exclusive property of Customer.

Nothing in this Section 6 shall limit IGX’s ownership of patent, copyright or other intellectual property or trade secret rights in any information developed independently of this Agreement even though such information may have been used in connection with IGX’s performance under this Agreement.  IGX or its employees or subcontractors may provide similar services to others and use or disclose to others the general knowledge, skill and experience that IGX and they have developed over the years, including under this Agreement.
 
7. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; DISCLAIMERS.
 

IGX represents and warrants that Services it performs pursuant to a SOW will be performed with reasonable care and skill in accordance with industry standards generally prevailing among providers of similar services under similar circumstances. Customer shall notify IGX of any noncompliance with the foregoing warranty prior to completion of the Services or within five (5) business days thereafter, failing which Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the Services provided pursuant to the relevant SOW.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Customer understands that IGX shall bear no responsibility for the performance, repair or warranty of any of Customer’s software or equipment or any software, hardware product or service provided to Customer by a third party and/or vendor, and Customer shall look solely to the third party provider for all remedies and support with regard to such products or service.  
     

IGX does not provide warranties on Products it does not manufacture, whether with respect to design, performance, specifications, functionality or compatibility with Customer’s system or otherwise.  Without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, IGX does not warrant that such Products cannot cause or are free from susceptibility to security or data breaches. Any Product warranty and any rights to indemnification for claims or losses related to a Product must come directly from the manufacturer. To the extent authorized, however, IGX will pass through to Customer any transferable Product warranties, indemnities, and remedies provided to IGX by the manufacturer.
     

ALL WARRANTIES PROVIDED HEREIN ARE PERSONAL TO, AND INTENDED SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF, CUSTOMER AND DO NOT EXTEND TO ANY THIRD PARTY.  THE WARRANTIES SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 7 ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT AND IGX HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH PRODUCTS SOLD OR SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES PROVIDED INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT OR OTHERWISE.

IN NO EVENT SHALL IGX BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY LOSSES OR DAMAGES, LOST DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR LOST PROFITS OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE, ARISING OUT OF OR CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT.  IGX’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY HEREUNDER, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES, WHICH SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE ACT, OMISSION OR OTHER EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY OR THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE DIRECTLY CAUSING SUCH DAMAGES..  

 
B.    No action whatsoever arising out of transactions under this Agreement may be initiated by either Party more than one (1) year after the cause of action accrued, except for payments owed.  In no event shall IGX be liable for claims by a third party.  Each Party acknowledges that this Section 8 sets forth a reasonable allocation of liability between them, and that IGX’s pricing is offered in reliance on the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations and exclusions set forth in this Agreement.   
 
9.       NON-HIRING OF EMPLOYEES.  Customer acknowledges that IGX and its Affiliates have invested significant resources in the training of its employees and that these employees are a valuable resource.  Therefore, if IGX or one of its Affiliates provides Services under this Agreement, Customer agrees that during the term of this Agreement and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Customer shall not solicit for hire or hire employees of IGX or such Affiliate (or anyone who has been employed by IGX or the Affiliate within the month prior to the date of solicitation). Should such a hiring take place, Customer shall pay to IGX or the Affliate a fee in an amount equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the employee’s total annual compensation (“Finder’s Fee”). The Parties hereby acknowledge that they have had the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice on the effect of this Section and agree that the amount of the Finder’s Fee represents a fair and reasonable sum in the circumstances.

11.    NOTICES.  Notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and delivered in person or by a nationally recognized overnight carrier that obtains a receipt to the respective Party’s address set forth in the introductory paragraph of this Agreement or to such other address as the Party from time to time may have designated by written notice.  Notices shall be deemed given when delivery is confirmed or on the date of first refusal.  Notices of default may first be given orally if followed by written notice according to this Section 11.  A copy of each notice to IGX shall be delivered simultaneously to the General Counsel of its parent company, ePlus Technology, inc., at 13595 Dulles Technology Drive, Herndon, VA 20171 USA, with copy to Vice President, Contracts at the same address.
 
12. PRESS RELEASES.  Any press release, announcement, publication or any other media release regarding this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties prior to release.  Neither Party shall make any representations or warranties about the other Party that the other Party has not first approved in writing.
 
13.  TERM AND TERMINATION.  
 

Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall, unless otherwise terminated as provided in this Agreement, continue for an initial period of 12 months and, thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive twelve (12) month periods unless or until a Party provides written notice to the other of its intention to terminate in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
     

Termination.  At any time that there is no uncompleted SOW or non-cancelable order outstanding (but not otherwise), either Party may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason on fifteen (15) days written notice to the other Party.  Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any SOW with immediate effect on giving written notice to the other Party if: (i) the other Party commits a material breach of this Agreement and/or the SOW (including without limitation failure to pay any amount due) and such breach is not remediable or has not been remedied within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice to remedy such breach; or (ii) the other Party suffers an Insolvency Event.  IGX may terminate this Agreement and/or any SOW with immediate effect on giving written notice to Customer if Customer fails to pay any amount due to IGX by the due date for payment and such payment remains outstanding seven (7) days after Customer receives written notice to make such payment. If a breach by its nature cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, then without prejudice to the non-breaching Party’s rights and remedies, the breaching Party shall commence to cure the breach within such period, and then diligently prosecute such cure to completion. 

 
For the purposes of this Section 13.B, an “Insolvency Event” means: the occurrence of any of the following in respect of a party: (a) that Party stops or suspends its business or payment of its debts or is unable to pay its debts (within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act 1986) or otherwise becomes insolvent or (being a partnership) suffers bankruptcy orders being made against any one of its partners; (b) an administrator, administrative receiver, receiver or manager, liquidator or other similar officer is appointed in respect of that party or a notice of intention to appoint an administrator in respect of that Party is given; (c) a winding up order or bankruptcy order is made against that Party or that Party passes a resolution or makes a determination for it to be wound up; (d) a judgment, order or award made against that Party is outstanding and not discharged within 10 days or any distress, execution, sequestration or similar process is levied on or commenced against any of the assets of that party and not lifted, withdrawn or discharged within 10 days; (e) any arrangement, compromise or composition of that Party’s debts is proposed or made by or with that Party; or (f) any event occurs in relation to that Party in any jurisdiction in which it is incorporated, resident or carries on business which is analogous to any of those stated in this definition.
 
C.    Effect of Termination.  Termination does not relieve Customer’s obligations to pay all accrued fees, including all charges for Products ordered prior to such termination.  Termination of a SOW shall not modify the term of this Agreement or the term of any other SOW. Customer agrees that upon termination of a SOW it shall pay IGX for all fees and costs incurred in the performance of its Services up to and including the effective date of termination. Termination of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of each Party accrued at the date of Termination.  Any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue in force on or after termination or expiry of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
 
14.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.
     

Assignment and Subcontracting.  Except any assignment by IGX of its right to receive payments, neither Party shall sell, assign, subcontract, transfer or otherwise deal with its rights or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the other Party’s prior written consent or as expressly permitted by this Agreement.   Any such attempted assignment or dealing shall be void.  IGX reserves the right to subcontract with other individuals and businesses for the performance of Services under this Agreement, but such subcontracts shall not constitute assignment of IGX’s obligations or rights hereunder.
     

Severability.If any provision or part-provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion of any provision or part-provision under this Section will not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provision or part-provision of this SOW.
     

Governing Law and Jurisdiction.This Agreement and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.
     

Force Majeure.  Neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement if the delay or failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement results from an event or circumstance (a “Force Majeure Event”) resulting from a judicial or government decree or regulation which is not such Party’s fault, communication line failure, power failure, any natural disaster or act of God, war, terrorism, invasion, insurrection, riot, the order of any civil or military authority, fire, flood, earthquake, weather, lockouts, strikes, the unavailability of personnel due to injury, sickness, death or termination of employment, either voluntary or involuntary, or, without limitation, any other cause beyond such Party’s reasonable control, the Party so affected shall promptly give notice to the other Party and shall use reasonable commercial efforts to resume performance. Upon delivery of such notice, all obligations under this Agreement shall be immediately suspended.  If the period of nonperformance exceeds fifteen (15) days, the Party receiving notice of a Force Majeure Event may, by giving written notice, terminate this Agreement or any SOW.  Delays in delivery due to Force Majeure Events shall automatically extend the delivery date for a period equal to the duration of such events.  A Force Majeure Event, however, shall not apply to or extend Customer’s obligation to pay for Products or Services.
     
 

Survival of Terms.  The provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13.C, 14 and 15 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and/or a SOW for any reason.
 
 
Counterparts.This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all such counterparts shall constitute one and the same Agreement. Transmission of an executed counterpart of this SOW (but for the avoidance of doubt not just a signature page) by fax or email (in PDF, JPEG or other agreed format) shall take effect as delivery of an executed counterpart of this SOW. If either method of delivery is adopted, without prejudice to the validity of the agreement thus made, each Party shall provide the other with the original of such counterpart as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. No counterpart shall be effective until each Party has executed and delivered at least one counterpart.
     

Variation.  This Agreement may be modified only by means of a duly executed written amendment.  Neither the terms of any purchase order, invoice, or other instrument documenting a payment or transaction that is issued by either Party in connection this Agreement, nor any other act, document, usage, custom, or course of dealing shall modify the terms of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be enforceable in accordance with its terms when signed by each of the Parties hereto.
     

Third Party Rights.  No one other than a party to this Agreement, their successors and permitted assignees, shall have any right to enforce any of its terms.
     

No waiver.  No failure or delay by a Party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

 
15. ANTI-BRIBERY.  
 

Customer shall: (i) comply with all applicable laws, statutes, regulations and codes relating to anti-bribery and anti-corruption including the Bribery Act 2010 (“Relevant Requirements”); (ii) comply with IGX’s ethics and anti-bribery policies as may be notified to Customer in writing from time to time (“Relevant Policies”); (iii) have and shall maintain in place throughout the term of this Agreement its own policies and procedures, including adequate procedures under the Bribery Act 2010, to ensure compliance with the Relevant Requirements and the Relevant Policies, and will enforce them where appropriate; (iv) promptly report to IGX any request or demand for any undue financial or other advantage of any kind received by Customer in connection with the performance of this Agreement; and (v) immediately notify IGX in writing if a foreign public official becomes an officer or employee of Customer or acquires a direct or indirect interest in Customer, and Customer warrants that it has no foreign public officials as direct or indirect owners, officers or employees at the date of this Agreement.

Code of Conduct






Version History

The Board last approved changes to the Code of Conduct on February 17, 2016

Description of Revisions:  Revisions include:  Specifically addressing data privacy and workplace privacy; Clarifying the Ethical Reporting section to separately address Business Records and Public Disclosures; Clarifying the Conflict of Interest section to be simpler and to reference the Company’s Related Person Transaction Policy; Updating the Gifts language to reference the Company’s Gifts Policy; Updating the Improper Payments language to be broader, and to specifically reference the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.  Additional changes to improve readability were made to several sections, including the Political Process, Equal Opportunity and No Harassment sections.

Introduction

ePlus requires all employees to use their judgment, to be accountable for their actions, and to conduct business with integrity.

The ePlus Code of Conduct outlines the standards of ethical behavior ePlus expects of you in performing the duties of your position with ePlus. Throughout this document, we will abbreviate these standards as the “Code.”

You should keep in mind these important considerations when reading this Code:

The Code applies to all of our employees, officers and directors regardless of location or position.
You should follow this Code in letter and in spirit, along with any applicable laws, regulations and other ePlus policies and procedures.
You may never violate this Code, or any Corporate Policy, simply because someone directs you to do so. If you receive such a request you must refuse, and you should follow the reporting procedures detailed within the Code.

In addition to governing conduct among employees, the Code governs conduct between employees and customers, competitors, and the numerous business providers who assist ePlus every day, including vendors and contractors.

The Code has been approved by the ePlus Board of Directors. Because we want our customers, business partners and investors to understand how we do business, and what they can expect from us, the Code is published on our corporate website, and also in the ePlus Employee Handbook.

Amendments and Waivers

ePlus will publicly disclose all material amendments and any waivers for senior financial officers, executive officers or directors, to the extent required by law.


Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations

Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which ePlus’ ethical standards are built. All employees and officers must respect and obey the laws, rules and regulations of the cities, states and countries in which we operate, whether or not specifically addressed in the Code. Although employees and officers are not expected to know the details of each of these laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel.

If a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law. If you have any questions about conflicts, please discuss with your manager, HR, the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel for additional guidance. You may also seek advice from any attorney or other advisor you select, at your expense.

Antitrust Laws

You must comply with applicable antitrust and similar laws that regulate competition in the countries in which we operate. These laws prohibit:

Agreements to fix prices, bid rigging, market allocation and collusion (including price sharing) with competitors;
Boycotts, certain exclusive dealing arrangements and price discrimination agreements; and
Unfair trade practices, including bribery, misappropriation of trade secrets, deception, intimidation and similar unfair practices.

Environmental Laws

ePlus complies with all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations. You should strive to utilize resources appropriately and efficiently and dispose of all waste in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

Political Process

Contributions of Company funds or the use of Company assets or facilities for the benefit of political parties or candidates is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Chief Financial Officer or the General Counsel.

All employees may participate personally in the political process and support political parties  and candidates of their choice. You should not in any way suggest that ePlus endorses  or supports a political activity or view, however, you may disclose ePlus as your employer, if requested, on a political donation form.

Ethical Reporting

Business Records

Customers, suppliers, and government agencies rely upon the integrity of our business records. All business records, such as timecards, purchase orders, invoices, expense reports, certifications and financial records must accurately reflect the transactions of the Company in accordance with all applicable requirements. We will not create or permit false or misleading entries to be made  in the records of the Company under any circumstances.

Public Disclosures

ePlus requires full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with, or submitted to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and in other public filings and communications. The standards for accounting and financial reporting require the proper recording of, and accounting for, revenues, costs, expenses, assets, and liabilities. If you have responsibility for, or any involvement in, these areas, you must understand and adhere to these rules and prepare all reports, books and records of ePlus with care and honesty, and adhere to all internal control policies and procedures.

Violations of laws associated with accounting and financial reporting can result in fines, penalties, and imprisonment and they can lead to a loss of public faith in the Company. If you become aware of any action related to accounting or financial reporting that you believe may be improper, you should submit your concerns to the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel. Alternatively, employees can use the ePlus internal web-based communication channel, VOICE IT, or call the Hotline, which is managed by a third-party service provider. Callers have the option to remain anonymous.

Expenses

Employees are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable business-related expenses, but only if those expenses were actually incurred and fall within the parameters detailed within the ePlus Travel and Expense Policy. Business expense reports must be accurate, include all supporting documentation, and be submitted in a timely manner. Submitting an expense account for meals not eaten, miles not driven, airline tickets not used, or any other expense not incurred as submitted, is dishonest reporting.

Data Privacy

ePlus typically does not possess personal information, except with regard to our employees. We take appropriate steps to protect information relating to individuals, whether they are employees, customers, investors or vendor partners. We are responsible for collecting, processing and transferring personal data only for lawful and legitimate business purposes, and use care in safeguarding the confidentiality and security of personal data, and in respecting personal privacy.
 
Workplace Privacy

As an ePlus employee, it is important that you understand that ePlus may take the following  steps when you access any ePlus network or system, or use any device, regardless of ownership, to conduct ePlus business:

Access, search, monitor, and archive all data and messages sent, accessed, viewed, or stored;
Conduct physical, video, or electronic surveillance (as permitted by law); and
Review IM, phone, and similar records, and web-surfing history.


Our People

ePlus’ success depends on its employees. It depends on people who innovate and are committed to growing our business responsibly, people who dedicate themselves to really satisfying customers, helping partners, and people who are accountable for achieving challenging goals with unwavering integrity. People who are leaders, who appreciate that to be truly great, we must continually strive to better ourselves, and help others improve.

Equal Opportunity

ePlus employs, trains, promotes and compensates individuals based on merit, job-related qualifications and abilities. ePlus is committed to providing equal opportunity without regard to race, color, religious creed, sex, gender, gender expression, gender identity, transgender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, marital status (including same-sex marriages), genetic predisposition/carrier status, disability or any other classification proscribed under federal, state or local law.

No Harassment

Any kind of harassment by or against our employees is prohibited. All employees must comply with our Sexual Harassment Policy. Prohibited conduct includes the making of unwelcome sexual advances or engaging in any other conduct with sexual overtones which interferes with an individual’s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. All instances of sexual harassment should be reported, and will be investigated, as described in the Sexual Harassment Policy.

Health and Safety

ePlus is committed to providing employees with a safe and healthy work environment. All employees have a responsibility for maintaining the health and safety of the work environment by following environmental, safety and health rules and practices, and for reporting accidents, injuries, and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.
 
All employees are expected to perform their company-related work in a safe manner, free from the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.

Workplace Violence

We all deserve to work in an environment that is free from violence or hostility. ePlus will not tolerate any threatening, hostile or abusive behavior by employees, or from anyone with whom an ePlus employee comes into contact in the course of doing business for ePlus.

You must report any instance of violence, hostile behavior or possession of weapons on Company property to your supervisor or Human Resources immediately. In cases of imminent danger, you should call 911 or local law enforcement first, and then the General Counsel, Human Resources, or your manager. Supervisors are expected to inform the VP of Human Resources or the General Counsel no later than 24-hours after any reports or act or threat of violence, even if the situation has been addressed and resolved.

Leadership

We expect our leaders to set an example and be role models in every respect. As leaders, you must ensure that employees have sufficient information to comply with laws and policies, and create a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance. This culture must encourage all employees to raise concerns when they arise. We must never sacrifice ethical and compliant behavior in the pursuit of business objectives or generate an environment where employees are fearful to raise concerns.


Working with Others

The integrity of ePlus is a key component of our reputation, trustworthiness and service. The people that ePlus conducts business with expect and deserve fair, honest and respectful information and service. You are responsible for your role in the delivery of that standard of service.

Relations with Government Officials and Employees

You may not make any payments to or for the benefit of any government official or employee in order to secure business or to obtain special concessions. Relations with government representatives, even where personal friendships may be involved, must be legal, in good taste and such that full public disclosure would in no way damage ePlus’ reputation.

Relations with Contractors and Vendors

Relationships with our contractors and vendors are to be managed in a fair and reasonable manner, consistent with applicable laws and ethical business practices. The selection of contractors and vendors will be made on the basis of objective criteria, including quality, technical  excellence,  price,  delivery,  adherence  to  schedules,  service  and  maintenance     of
 
adequate sources of supply. Purchasing decisions will be based on the vendor’s ability to meet our needs, and not on personal relationships and friendships.

Authority to make ePlus Commitments

The ePlus management system and contracting processes are designed to help ePlus protect its assets and to provide the appropriate controls needed for ePlus to run its business effectively  with its customers, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Authorities are defined within the ePlus ‘Authority Matrix’.

Commitments must be visible to ePlus accounting to help ensure the accuracy of ePlus’ financial results. Making business commitments outside of the most current and internally published Authority Matrix is prohibited.


Conflicts of Interest

ePlus respects the right of all employees to engage in personal activities outside of work. However, each of us has the responsibility to avoid activities and relationships which conflict with our job responsibilities or the interests of ePlus.

Any employee activity that may involve a conflict of interest, or may reasonably create an appearance of a conflict of interest, must first be approved by the Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of the Chief Compliance Officer or Company legal counsel, and must be in compliance with the Company’s Related Person Transaction Policy.

Examples of Conflicts of Interest include:

Holding a significant and undisclosed financial interest in a current or reasonably anticipated customer, supplier or competitor of ePlus, or serving as an employee consultant or director of that business. (Holding a small amount, such as less than 5%, of the publicly-traded stock of our suppliers or customers would not constitute a conflict of interest.)
Directing ePlus business to a supplier owned or managed by a relative.
Accepting “spiffs” from vendors other than in accordance with our Gift Policy.
Using confidential ePlus information for personal benefit, or for the benefit of others.
Performing work or rendering services for any entity who does, or seeks to do, business with ePlus, outside the normal course of your employment, without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer (or the Board of Directors, if  you are an executive officer).

Gifts

Although the exchange of gifts and entertainment can promote a successful working relationship and  goodwill,  you must  follow all  applicable laws and  company rules  and procedures.     You
 
should assume that any gift given or received will be made public, and should not offer or accept any gift that might reasonably be viewed negatively if disclosed.

ePlus has a Gift Policy that addresses common gift situations, and with which all employees are required to comply. ePlus also has an online reporting tool for employees to report gifts given or received that are not otherwise addressed under the policy. The Gift Policy can be found on eConnect, in the Human Resources’ policies section.

Improper Payments

It is never appropriate to offer or receive bribes, kickbacks or improper payments. This prohibition applies to dealings with current and potential customers, suppliers, representatives, consultants or other business partners seeking to establish a relationship with ePlus. Many countries and U.S. states have laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and commercial bribery. In particular, employees should be aware of, and comply with, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act.

If you are unsure if a payment or gift is inappropriate or illegal, you should seek guidance from the General Counsel.

Personally Gaining From Corporate Opportunities

You owe a duty to ePlus to advance its legitimate interests. You cannot take any business opportunity you learn of as a result of your employment or use any ePlus property for your personal benefit or for the benefit of a family member. For example, you should not acquire any interest in a company when you know that ePlus may take or is taking steps to acquire an interest in that company. If you learn of a business opportunity you are interested in pursuing that is within ePlus’ existing or proposed lines of business, you should inform your supervisor, ePlus’ Chief Financial Officer or, in the case of executive officers, the Board of Directors. You should not personally pursue the business opportunity until ePlus decides not to pursue it and grants approval for you to do so.

Participation on Boards of Directors

It is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of a company that is in competition with ePlus.

Employees and officers should not serve as a director of any other for-profit company, other than on behalf of ePlus, without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or, in the case of the Chief Financial officer, the Chief Executive Officer. In the case of any employee who is also a director of ePlus, service as director of any other for-profit company must be approved by ePlus’ Board  of Directors.

Confidential and Proprietary Information

Confidentiality

Customers, vendors, and others disclose confidential information to ePlus for business purposes. Each employee has a responsibility to protect and maintain the confidentiality of this information. Failure to properly protect customer and third-party information may damage our relationships with these important business partners, and may result in legal liability.

ePlus owns all information, in any form (including electronic information), that is created or used in support of its activities. This information is a valuable asset and ePlus expects you to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. This information includes ePlus customer, vendor, business  partner and employee data. Federal, state and foreign laws may restrict the use of this  information and may penalize you if you use or disclose it. You should protect information pertaining to ePlus’ competitive position, business strategies and information relating to negotiations with employees or third parties and share it only with employees who need to know it in order to perform his or her job. Nothing in this policy shall be deemed to interfere with employee disclosure rights protected by law.

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information

You should carefully maintain and manage the intellectual property rights of ePlus to which you have access, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses and trade secrets, to preserve and protect their value. In addition, you should respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you violate other’s intellectual property rights, you and ePlus could face substantial liability, including criminal penalties. Intellectual property that you create during the course of your employment belongs to ePlus. You must share any innovations or inventions you create with your supervisor so that ePlus can take steps to protect these valuable assets.

Insider Trading

Federal and state securities laws and ePlus’ policies prohibit you from:

Purchasing or selling ePlus securities while you know material, nonpublic information about ePlus; and
Disclosing material, nonpublic information, except as permitted by law.

In order to better protect non-public information, all confidential Company business information and information of our customers, vendors and business partners, should be disseminated internally only on a “need-to-know” basis. For more information, employees should refer to the ePlus Insider Trading Policy which is posted on the Corporate Intranet and is included as an Appendix to the ePlus Employee Handbook.

Because of the complexity of insider information and insider trading, and the severity of the punishments involved, which can include criminal prosecution, you should seek the advice of
 
ePlus’ General Counsel on any questions regarding this subject. In some cases, you may want to retain an attorney on your own to advise you.

Requests for information from the media, analysts, attorneys, law enforcement officers and others.

What may appear to be an innocent request for information could result in serious harm to our company. Be alert to requests for information from outside of ePlus.

You should not initiate contact with the media, analysts, attorneys or others.

If you receive a request for information from these sources, you must direct the caller to the Company’s main telephone number (703) 984-8400 or 888-482-1122. The call will then be directed to the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Investor Relations Department.

Inadvertent Disclosure

To avoid inadvertent disclosure, never discuss with any unauthorized person confidential information. Furthermore, you should not discuss such information even with authorized ePlus employees if you are in the presence of others who are not authorized, for example, at a trade show reception or in a public area. You should also not discuss such information with family members or with friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass the information on to someone else.

If you ever suspect or know that you or someone else has inadvertently disclosed information  that is confidential or non-public, you must contact the General Counsel immediately.


Protection and Proper Use of Company Assets

Every employee must properly use, protect, and safeguard Company property, both tangible and intangible, as well as the property of our customers, vendors and business partners that is in our possession.

ePlus’ assets include our physical assets and our extremely valuable proprietary information,  such as ePlus’ intellectual property and ePlus confidential information, noted in the previous section.

Care should be taken to ensure that assets are not misappropriated, loaned to others, or sold or donated, without appropriate authorization. ePlus will take appropriate steps, including legal measures, to protect its assets.

You have an obligation to care for and protect the equipment that has been provided to you. If you use ePlus equipment at your home or off site, you must take precautions to protect it from
 
theft or damage, just as if it were your own. If you leave ePlus employment, you must immediately return all Company-owned equipment.


How To Report Possible Violations

Every employee has a responsibility to promptly report any issue or concern he believes, in good faith, may constitute a violation of the Code or any other ePlus Policy. We also encourage you to come forward if you encounter a situation that “just doesn’t feel right.” Your commitment to  take action to share your concerns will help to ensure an ethical workplace for everyone.

You should report suspicions to only those people who absolutely need to know. This protects people from allegations that may not be proven and prevents the possible destruction of  evidence. The Company does not allow retaliation for reports made in good faith.

You have several options available for voicing you concerns:

Start by talking with your immediate manager. ePlus managers have a duty to promote an open and honest environment where members of their teams can feel comfortable about voicing their concerns without fear of retaliation.

If you do not feel comfortable discussing your concern with your manager, or after seeking assistance you do not feel the outcome resolved your issue, please contact a Human Resources representative.

If you do not feel comfortable with either of the first two options, or after seeking assistance, you do not feel the issue was appropriately addressed or resolved, please contact the Chief Financial Officer or the General Counsel.

In addition to the options already listed, you can submit comments or concerns via the Company’s internal web-based communication channel “VOICE IT”. VOICE IT submissions are received by HR and the General Counsel.

Also, ePlus has retained the services of an external provider, to manage a confidential Whistleblower Hotline for ePlus employees. The Hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Your concern will be documented by the third party. An independent ePlus Board member, the General Counsel and the Vice President of Human Resources receive details of all ePlus-related calls made, directly from the third-party provider.

Non-ePlus employees should contact the Company’s main telephone number (703) 984-8400 or 888-482-1122. The call will then be directed to the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Investor Relations Department.

Style Scores:



B Value | A Growth | C Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
