AXPM We are different





































































 













AXPM Difference
Why do it the same way?
Cars are different now than they were 10 years ago. Brackets are different now than they were 10 years ago. Why do even new management softwares look and have the same features as 10 years ago? We want you to love your software and we want your patients to love it too!


 


AXPM Difference
Multi-Speciality
We are a multi-specialty software built on the HTML5 platform. Pedo, Ortho, iPads, PC, Macs, Android, iOS, Linux. We can answer yes! If your software was not built from day one as multi-specialty chances are it is retrofit to work and will not work well.


 


AXPM Difference
Secure Communication
Finally a software that built in secure communication into the platform. Securely share images, treatment notes, documents and more! Keeping you and your patients data safe! Heck we even have a built in phone system! All HIPAA compliant. 


 




We are different, and we are okay with that!

All practice management software can take payments, schedule payments, manage a ledger, create a letter and track treatment for patients.  It is how those things are done and the new never before seen features in practice management software that makes us different.
At AXPM One we are reinventing practice management and rethinking the old ways. Times change and so should your practice management software. We are committed to continue to bring you new innovative features that have never been part of a software.

Does your practice management software have a built-in email client?
What about secure HIPAA compliant sharing?
Wireless Imaging?
Can you text with patients and track all communication in their chart?
Technology to help close more cases?
What about an interactive patient portal?
Built-in phone system that pulls up patient’s charts?

Sure for some of those you can use a third party – but by the time you do that you are using 3-6 piece of software. That is just crazy!
Why should you have to do that when we can handle it all for much less than you are currently paying!
Call us today at 844-488-AXPM to learn more!

Run your practice like a business
"We are all working together, that is the secret," - Sam Walton
Running your practice like a business can be a tall task for somebody who just wants to make people smile. But our job is to make you smile by letting you focus on your patients first. We have re-invented practice management software so you can once again put the focus back on your patients.
We have re-thought practice management software and built technology like a smart scheduler, case closer and wifi photo auto transfer and load. We are working towards making you and your staffs life easier to make your patient have a better experience.
 


AXPM tips
Autopay Tip!
Help patients stay on top of things by setting up their auto payment with them. Together, you can discover when their paydays are and base payments on those dates. Setting it up for when they get paid every two weeks can make individual payments less pricey for the patient and more consistent for you. Everybody wins.







Axpm One
Case Closer Technology
Starting cases is harder than it has ever been. But we’re making it easier. With our Case Closer Technology, treatment coordinators can adjust down payments, payment frequency, monthly amounts and term lengths to find the best plan for both the patient and the practice. Patients can even access it from anywhere in order to accept treatments, sign contracts, make payments and schedule appointments.









Axpm One
Smart Scheduling
Under the old template system, there’s no such thing as a perfect day. That’s why Smart Scheduling was born. Smart Scheduling uses an algorithm that recalculates every time you or your patient sets up an appointment. This makes it more efficient to set up each appointment, while also continuously making your overall schedule for the day as perfect as possible.  Practice smarter, not harder.








AXPM One
Reporting and Analytics
Reporting and Analytics sound boring. At least, that’s the way we used to see it. But we make reporting dynamic and easy to read and understand. You can even anonymously view how your practice stacks up against the rest of the country. And you should like how it looks from the top, with us on your side.









AXPM One
Secure Sharing
We give you the ability to digitally send patient photos and medical stats directly to other doctors. In a safe and sensitive manner, you can exchange vital information for all patients you have in common, or just the ones you choose. And if the other practice is savvy enough to use AXPM One as well, it all goes right into the chart.








AXPM One
Latest Technology and Platform
Everything runs on HTML5 and is based in The Cloud. That means there is nothing to install and you can pump the brakes on your IT costs. The clients we work with save an average of $25,000 a year in that department. Use Macs, PCs, Android, iOS, Chrome OS and even Linux. Any operating system works!








AXPM One
Communication
With One, we have a fully integrated email client. 2-way text messaging is also built-in. You can text message with 
patients directly out of the software. Not only can you send appointment reminders via email and text but if they reply 
to those text messages your staff and text back with them to find a new time! We even have your phone system built-in. Get rid of that expensive 3rd party expense!








AXPM One
Accrual and Cash Accounting
Good news - you can now run your reports for Accrual and Cash basis accounting! Finally - making you and your accountant's life easier!








AXPM One
HR and Benefits
One of the biggest departments that practices can receive some much needed help from us is human resources. Our HR Management and Benefit Enrollment services are part of what we offer as an insurance broker, letting you and your employees to stay on top of all the vital individual and group info that comes with the territory.








AXPM One
Wireless Imaging
With so much of your world running wirelessly, you can now add imaging to the list of things you don’t have to worry about tripping over. There are no cords in sight as you seamlessly and digitally drop photos into patient charts so that they can be ready to go instantaneously.

Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC Advises AXPM Dental Management, LLC on its Capital Raise with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group L.P.






Jul 6, 2017, 12:00pm EDT














CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Arkansas-based AXPM Dental Management, LLC d/b/a Rock Dental Brands (Rock Dental), on its recent debt financing with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (GSSLG). Rock Dental, a leading multi-specialty dental service organization, engaged Deloitte Corporate Finance to obtain financing for a series of strategic acquisitions and to refinance an incumbent lender.  



After its recent acquisitions, Rock Dental now operates 69 practices in Arkansas and Missouri. The financing provided by GSSLG allowed Rock Dental to refinance an existing credit facility, close the aforementioned acquisitions and continue to execute on its strategic growth initiatives.
"As we continue with our acquisition strategy, Deloitte Corporate Finance has played an integral role in helping evaluate capital structure and financing options," said Merritt Dake, CEO of AXPM Dental Management, LLC. "DCF provided invaluable insight regarding this type of transaction in the dental space and the appetite of capital markets, as well as thoughtful guidance throughout the entire process."
John Deering, managing director, Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC, said, "Rock Dental's reputation for providing high quality patient care, as well as its impressive track record of growth led to an excellent match with GSSLG, which has extensive experience in the health care sector." 
Tom Spivey, managing director, Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC, added, "Goldman Sachs' debt facility will allow Rock Dental to further solidify its position as a leading dental service organization." 
About AXPM Dental Management, LLC, d/b/a Rock Dental Brands Rock Dental is a leading dental service organization in Arkansas and Missouri, operating orthodontic, pediatric dental, oral surgery, and general dental clinics. The Little Rock-based company has its roots going back to 1986, when founder Dr. Mark Dake opened an orthodontic clinic in West Plains, Missouri. Focused on financial diligence, doctor collaboration, continuing education, and providing the highest quality of patient care possible, the Company grew through acquisitions and de novo clinic additions to what it is today – a fully integrated dental service organization operating four distinct brands under the Rock Dental umbrella. For more information, visit http://rockdentalbrands.com/.

Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC Advises AXPM Dental Management, LLC On Its Capital Raise With Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group L.P.









PR Newswire




Jul 6, 2017 12:00 PM EDT













 




























































  CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Arkansas-based AXPM Dental Management, LLC d/b/a Rock Dental Brands (Rock Dental), on its recent debt financing with Goldman Sachs Specialty Lending Group, L.P. (GSSLG). Rock Dental, a leading multi-specialty dental service organization, engaged Deloitte Corporate Finance to obtain financing for a series of strategic acquisitions and to refinance an incumbent lender.      After its recent acquisitions, Rock Dental now operates 69 practices in Arkansas and Missouri. The financing provided by GSSLG allowed Rock Dental to refinance an existing credit facility, close the aforementioned acquisitions and continue to execute on its strategic growth initiatives. "As we continue with our acquisition strategy, Deloitte Corporate Finance has played an integral role in helping evaluate capital structure and financing options," said Merritt Dake, CEO of AXPM Dental Management, LLC. "DCF provided invaluable insight regarding this type of transaction in the dental space and the appetite of capital markets, as well as thoughtful guidance throughout the entire process."  John Deering, managing director, Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC, said, "Rock Dental's reputation for providing high quality patient care, as well as its impressive track record of growth led to an excellent match with GSSLG, which has extensive experience in the health care sector."  Tom Spivey, managing director, Deloitte Corporate Finance LLC, added, "Goldman Sachs' debt facility will allow Rock Dental to further solidify its position as a leading dental service organization."   About AXPM Dental Management, LLC, d/b/a Rock Dental Brands  Rock Dental is a leading dental service organization in Arkansas and Missouri, operating orthodontic, pediatric dental, oral surgery, and general dental clinics. The Little Rock-based company has its roots going back to 1986, when founder Dr. Mark Dake opened an orthodontic clinic in West Plains, Missouri. Focused on financial diligence, doctor collaboration, continuing education, and providing the highest quality of patient care possible, the Company grew through acquisitions and de novo clinic additions to what it is today - a fully integrated dental service organization operating four distinct brands under the Rock Dental umbrella.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Our passionate team working alongside yours.
We started in the dental industry and realized what was holding doctors back. It's not taking care of their patients that is slowing them down. It's taking care of their practice. At last, a systematic software and consulting solution combined with industry expertise.

Cloud-based practice management software, business services, consulting.  We created AXPM to fulfill a need.  Our business model worked so well that we want to share it with you.
