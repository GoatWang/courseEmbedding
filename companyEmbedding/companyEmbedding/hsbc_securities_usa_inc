Fantastic Crew, terrible back office support and terrible infrastructure. Most of the HSBC employees phone agents and tellers have a polite demeanour & best intentions. On the contrary the banking system and norms they use are really painstaking. My time to open an account for a promotion I received was 1 hour and 30 mins, that included a waiting for ~15 mins, account details gathering for ~20 mins, waiting for ~30 mins and then finally ~25 mins with the teller. HSBC corporate run promotions without staffing the local branch with the right infrastructure. In my case, they couldn't accept the check because they let me walk in at 2:30p and by the time they could operate my account they were over 4:00p.

Now let's get to the promotion itself, no one from the call center or the administration team could tell you whether you are on track or not to receive your bonus, in fact the call center team has no clue what promotion you signed up on. They will ask you to reach via Bankmail(their secure messaging platform) and the mail team will redirect you to the call center. Its cyclic! 

Now if you were reading between the lines, my frustration is not the promotion. For a global bank of this footprint, their card systems, online account management, 4 websites before you can sign in, 40 mins of call wait time and the whole experience is so terrible. So in short, not only avoid this branch, (great staff) AVOID THE BANK like plague for domestic US banking at the least.







So my reason visiting the bank was to open a new checking account and take advantage of their promotional sign up. 

First off when entering the bank I was confused and felt lost. The entrance to the bank is not the traditional Chase or BofA. You walk pass the advisers offices before reaching the teller at the end of the hallway. Layout of the bank I would give 1 star because it didn't feel welcoming at all. 

I met the teller first, Christine a traditional Chinese lady. If you understand the Chinese culture then you know what I mean. She handed me some documents to fill out but didn't give me a pen. Luckily I had my own. Towards the end of my trip, she opened up more and I was able to understand the banking process more there. I give her 3.5 stars.

The person who assisted me in opening up my account was Jeff Liao. I was pretty honest with my feelings with the bank and told him I felt foreign in entering the banking facility. He is a very nice person and took the time to explain to me the different options they have. He was pretty patient and was able to answer all the questions I have and even walked me through th online sign on process. I would give him 5 stars, strongly recommend him if you need services at the bank. 

There was another lady, her office was second to the right of the teller. She looked like the Dragon lady at the office. Not friendly or helpful when she saw me and pretty much ignored me. I would give her 0 stars...

I'm just so very glad Jeff made my experience at HSBC bank so much better. Also, I wouldn't recommend coming here in a rush, their computer system is pretty slow.







Great office location which prompted me to open an account here but really bad day to day working 
The asked for all sorts of stupid and unrequited documents - even after DL and 3 credit cards, work ID they asked for home PG&E billing or comcast 
after the account was opened - i kept being logged out and had to re-set my password everytime in some complicated format
When calling you would have to give all details including anything personal - it was PAINFULL and so finally closed the account 

Really bad experience - had to spend 30 min on call to cancel a credit which had not been used for 3 months - if you done tell USA at the end of address - they will question which country so i added planet earth too the address 

Will stick to chase , WF & even BOA







Stay away!

The most atrocious bank of the world and most atrocious branch of the year award goes to HSBC Mountain View. 

1.They will extract as much fee as possible.
2. Even-though you have a premier account, the relationship manager will never contact you. Premier customers are supposed to not wait in the queue with the customer support, but you will end up in a queue.
3.They will recommend you  Mutual funds with higher load. Fiduciary duty for a toss. 
4.They are not open on Weekends and close early at 4pm. 
5.It is hard to understand the Tellers. 

Wells Fargo bank and others are a blessing in comparison.







Jemma B. said it all, really.  Our HSBC experience mirrored hers almost to the letter.  We experienced employees who simply did not know how to handle our seemingly standard requests, but were friendly and, at times, apologetic.  We were 'tag-teamed' on both visits by two women, one who seemed to be some sort of expeditor and one a teller.  This type of interaction meant having to repeat one's request at least twice.  I don't know how this type of scenario is meant to be efficient, which I think might have been the goal, but it wasn't.

The poor slob in line in front of us was in for an address change.  His request, like those of many an HSBC customer in the Bay Area, was one relating to a move from abroad.  We showed up in line behind him fifteen minutes prior to his having had the task completed.  Goodness knows how long he'd already been standing there.  

In my experience, both NYC and UK HSBC banks run a lot more smoothly.  -not sure why the CA affiliate would function any differently, but it does.  Those relocating to the Bay Area with an already existing HSBC acct. would do well to close it and bank elsewhere.







They don't deserved to be called as bank. Reception try to push you out the door by showing her know it all knowledge. Even you point out her mistake, she still refuse to let you to a banker. She just tell you stay where you are and she will going inside and ask. WTF... Canceling my hsbc account right now.







Terrible.

I had an HSBC account in the UK so thought the experience here would be the same. How very wrong I was.

When you walk in it's like a ghost town and when you do finally find someone to help you they pass you from one clueless employee to the next. 

Nothing is simple there - even something as quick as depositing a cheque can take up to half an hour. Couple that with the fact that I have to repeat everything three or four times because the lady who is serving me somehow can't understand my clear London accent?!

If you really feel like you absolutely MUST bank here, ask for Alvin. He seems to be the only person who has any idea what's going on.







Coming to this bank is always an exercise in frustration. I am now using my visits to train myself in principles of mindfulness, detachment, and deep breathing. 

There is always something here to practice deep breathing about, from making me sign again because my signature "doesn't look the same" to performing basic tasks at the speed of molasses. The layout of the branch is absurd. The rest of HSBC's services are similarly terrible, including the non-functioning relationship manager and the app and site which are so secure that I can never log on.







Only if I can give them zero star instead of one. They are simply terrible. They're absolutely the worst bank you can ever meet. The front desk lady is mean, impolite, anti-gay and racist. They ask you questions like they're an immigration officer, And, they are new to gay thing obviously. When I told them I want to open a joint account as a gay couple, the front desk lady simply gave me the ohmygod face which I can never forget. Beside, she doesn't know nothing,nun professional at all.







Odd lay-out, odd employees. Closest location to me *sigh*. Thankfully HSBC is simply an emergency cash account for me and not a main bank holding.

So, when you first walk in you're in a waiting room of sorts with no employee there behind the podium. OK, should I sign in or just sit down? Wait, there is no sign in sheet should I walk down this flat hallway across these glass offices? Ummm...hello? Anyone here?

Finally an account specialist comes out and oh, you just need a teller? It's all the way down at the end of the hallway. Silly me, why didn't I see a teller window ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK? How could I not see the invisible signs that read "This way, idiot?".

Ah, the teller window...why hello cranky teller who looks at me like I just woke him up or interrupted his favorite cat youtube video. Zero professionalism and actually the person he spoke with over the phone did all the work. 

Ugh, thankfully First Republic will soon have another South Bay location.







The worst bank I've dealt with in 2 decades. I spent $100K for a "premier account". My premier relationship manager doesn't pick up the phone and doesn't respond to emails. At the Palo Alto Branch you can't park because the employees park in the visitor spots. I was told to find parking on the road !!! 
They tout ease of withdrawing money around the world. What a joke. If you go to Asia they will treat you like crap unless you are fair skinned.
Their online site is a pathetic joke. I wish I had never opened this account. 

Oh and I think the positive reviews are from their own employees.







DO NOT BANK WITH HSBC!  

I had my mortgage, checking & brokerage accounts and credit card with HSBC at  one point.  They provided the WORST customer service.  The Palo Alto branch account manager never responded to my calls or emails.  The only way to talk to her was to keep calling back hoping one time she would pick up the phone.

This bank has countless, doesn't-make-sense policies.  For example,  I called to get a copy of my 1098 Form.  The rude representative said she couldn't mail one to me without my account number.  But she just looked up my account information using my SSN!  A simplest transaction must be done in writing via fax (no emails or phone).  


This bank is ridiculous!  Exercise no common sense.  Poorest customer service.  I will never give business to them again.







Let me first sum up that this is NOT your bank... "You are NOT a customer, you're an asset".

They seem nice and are very willing to help you setup an account, but that's because you've given them control of your money.  Once they have your money, they act like they are doing you a service by controlling it.

They can decide NOT to give you your money.  Yes you heard right, they refused a cash with drawl from the teller.  Not because of insufficient funds or due to not having the proper ID and account information.   They suggest that they don't always have sufficient funds to allow for cash with drawls sums that are perfectly ok at other banks (BofA for example).   If you with drawl funds regularly this is NOT the bank for you.

The place seems more like an old world investment bank.  Between the teller in the back, the sense of questioning as to why you would make a with drawl, the rude Indian manager... If you ask for your money, expect resistance and even a fight.  

With all the headache they caused, i can't say enough of how frustrating it is to work with this bank.   Yes most banks suck for one reason or another, but in the end all the other banks never refused me access to my money.







Do NOT bank here, the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The staff don't even know how their online banking works. Zero stars

Only if I can give them zero star instead of one. They are simply terrible. They're absolutely the worst bank you can ever meet. The front desk lady is mean, impolite, anti-gay and racist. They ask you questions like they're an immigration officer, And, they are new to gay thing obviously. When I told them I want to open a joint account as a gay couple, the front desk lady simply gave me the ohmygod face which I can never forget. Beside, she doesn't know nothing,nun professional at all.

Odd lay-out, odd employees. Closest location to me *sigh*. Thankfully HSBC is simply an emergency cash account for me and not a main bank holding.So, when you first walk in you're in a waiting room of sorts with no employee there behind the podium. OK, should I sign in or just sit down? Wait, there is no sign in sheet should I walk down this flat hallway across these glass offices? Ummm...hello? Anyone here?Finally an account specialist comes out and oh, you just need a teller? It's all the way down at the end of the hallway. Silly me, why didn't I see a teller window ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK? How could I not see the invisible signs that read "This way, idiot?".Ah, the teller window...why hello cranky teller who looks at me like I just woke him up or interrupted his favorite cat youtube video. Zero professionalism and actually the person he spoke with over the phone did all the work. Ugh, thankfully First Republic will soon have another South Bay location.

The worst bank I've dealt with in 2 decades. I spent $100K for a "premier account". My premier relationship manager doesn't pick up the phone and doesn't respond to emails. At the Palo Alto Branch you can't park because the employees park in the visitor spots. I was told to find parking on the road !!! They tout ease of withdrawing money around the world. What a joke. If you go to Asia they will treat you like crap unless you are fair skinned.Their online site is a pathetic joke. I wish I had never opened this account. Oh and I think the positive reviews are from their own employees.

DO NOT BANK WITH HSBC!  I had my mortgage, checking & brokerage accounts and credit card with HSBC at  one point.  They provided the WORST customer service.  The Palo Alto branch account manager never responded to my calls or emails.  The only way to talk to her was to keep calling back hoping one time she would pick up the phone.This bank has countless, doesn't-make-sense policies.  For example,  I called to get a copy of my 1098 Form.  The rude representative said she couldn't mail one to me without my account number.  But she just looked up my account information using my SSN!  A simplest transaction must be done in writing via fax (no emails or phone).  This bank is ridiculous!  Exercise no common sense.  Poorest customer service.  I will never give business to them again.

Let me first sum up that this is NOT your bank... "You are NOT a customer, you're an asset".They seem nice and are very willing to help you setup an account, but that's because you've given them control of your money.  Once they have your money, they act like they are doing you a service by controlling it.They can decide NOT to give you your money.  Yes you heard right, they refused a cash with drawl from the teller.  Not because of insufficient funds or due to not having the proper ID and account information.   They suggest that they don't always have sufficient funds to allow for cash with drawls sums that are perfectly ok at other banks (BofA for example).   If you with drawl funds regularly this is NOT the bank for you.The place seems more like an old world investment bank.  Between the teller in the back, the sense of questioning as to why you would make a with drawl, the rude Indian manager... If you ask for your money, expect resistance and even a fight.  With all the headache they caused, i can't say enough of how frustrating it is to work with this bank.   Yes most banks suck for one reason or another, but in the end all the other banks never refused me access to my money.

This is my first yelp review, which I decided to write because the manager at this HSBC branch went WAY WAY above and beyond helping me with a problem with an overseas HSBC account. She spent over an hour with me placing calls, downloading forms, helping me get them completed and sent off, and she was pleasant and patient through the entire process. I have no complaints about my current bank, but this experience raises the bar for what I consider to be excellent customer service. If I lived closer to Palo Alto, I would be very happy to do my banking here.







If the system let me do zero star, I will.  This is the most ridiculous operation,  a sorry excuse for a bank.  Went in for my safe deposit box during bank hour after driving across town and lucky enough to find a parking place (don't get me started on the parking but I guess that is not quite their fault).  They have the nerve to tell me that they are short staffed and everyone else is in a meeting so they cannot access the safe deposit box.  I can come back in 3-4 hours or make an appointment.

Why have bank hours if they can selectively decide certain service will not be available?  Maybe they should take a class in managing workload and resource balancing.  They are here to service the customers, not arbitrarily decide what they would not do for the day.  So frustrated with HSBC.

This is my first yelp review, which I decided to write because the manager at this HSBC branch went WAY WAY above and beyond helping me with a problem with an overseas HSBC account. She spent over an hour with me placing calls, downloading forms, helping me get them completed and sent off, and she was pleasant and patient through the entire process. I have no complaints about my current bank, but this experience raises the bar for what I consider to be excellent customer service. If I lived closer to Palo Alto, I would be very happy to do my banking here.

First to Review
        


If the system let me do zero star, I will.  This is the most ridiculous operation,  a sorry excuse for a bank.  Went in for my safe deposit box during bank hour after driving across town and lucky enough to find a parking place (don't get me started on the parking but I guess that is not quite their fault).  They have the nerve to tell me that they are short staffed and everyone else is in a meeting so they cannot access the safe deposit box.  I can come back in 3-4 hours or make an appointment.Why have bank hours if they can selectively decide certain service will not be available?  Maybe they should take a class in managing workload and resource balancing.  They are here to service the customers, not arbitrarily decide what they would not do for the day.  So frustrated with HSBC.

1 Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy.  These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets.  Prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of companies in more developed countries.  Securities of emerging market issuers generally have more risk than securities issued by issuers in more developed markets.  The less developed the country, the greater affect the risks  may have in an investment, and as a result, an investment may exhibit a higher degree of volatility than either the general domestic securities market or the securities markets of developed foreign countries.

Investing in Mutual funds







What are mutual funds?

Mutual funds are a type of pooled investment  vehicle.  Shareholders of a mutual fund  invest their money by purchasing shares of the fund.  The money that they pay for the shares is  pooled together and invested in a portfolio of securities, such as stocks,  bonds, or money market instruments. Mutual funds are professionally managed and operated by money managers, who maintain the portfolio in accordance with the fund's investments objectives as stated in the prospectus. 
Mutual funds, money market funds, and Exchange Traded Funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Professional or call 866.586.4722. Read it carefully before you invest.
An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
Popular investment disciplines which can involve mutual funds include:

Asset allocation1: a disciplined approach to long-term investing, designed to seek consistent exposure to markets. This  approach does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot  eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns. However, it may  be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns.
Dollar cost averaging2: a strategy  in which securities, typically mutual funds, are purchased in fixed dollar amounts at regular intervals, regardless of what direction the market is moving. While this method doesn't guarantee against losses, over time, this can help to reduce the average cost of acquired shares.  
Target date ("life cycle") investing3: investors choose a fund with a specified target date near a personal need or goal (such as retirement) for which they will need to access their invested funds. Though target date investing does not protect against loss of principal, the fund's risk exposure is gradually reduced as a target date draws nearer to prepare for the approaching liquidity needs. 

HSBC Global Asset Management fund options
Our World Selection Funds4offer asset allocation solutions–designed to help reduce the roller-coaster ride that volatile market conditions can generate. The five different fund strategies are aligned to the full spectrum of risk profiles:

Income Strategy Fund, 

Conservative Strategy Fund,

Moderate Strategy Fund,

Balanced Strategy Fund and 
 
Aggressive Strategy Fund. 


Explore our other exclusive asset allocation solutions.



In addition, the suite of HSBC Funds5 includes domestic money market funds and domestic and international equity and debt funds6. The 

HSBC Emerging Markets Debt Fund, 
HSBC Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund, HSBC Frontier Markets Fund and the HSBC Total Return Fund
 all provide access to some of the world's fastest growing markets through the lens of HSBC's deep global knowledge and experience. 

Additional funds from leading managers
A financial professional7 from HSBC Securities can also help you choose from a broad selection of third-party mutual funds. Each of these funds is thoroughly screened and regularly reviewed by the HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research team8 - a global team of research analysts dedicated to helping enhance our clients' portfolios by identifying third party money managers that show sustainable competitive advantages within their asset class.
Take advantage of our mutual fund experience
Mutual funds offer a convenient avenue for entering financial markets and can also become integral parts of a broader investment strategy. To fully understand your personal investment objectives and help determine which funds may be suited for your needs, an HSBC Securities financial professional8 will take the time to conduct a thorough financial review. To schedule your review, or to receive information on funds offered through HSBC Securities, please call 866.586.4722 or schedule a consultation online.

2 Dollar Cost Averaging is a plan of investing which allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations, but it does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
3 Target date funds invest in other funds, so performance can vary significantly based on the investment restrictions of the target date fund. A target date fund may have losses and does not guarantee that sufficient assets will be available for retirement or any specific return.
4 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is the investment adviser for the HSBC World Selection Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), serves as the distributor of the Funds' shares.
5 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the Advisor. HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited serves as investment subadviser to the HSBC Frontier Markets Fund. HSBC Global Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited serves as subadviser to the HSBC RMB Fixed Income Fund.  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. receive fees for providing various services to the funds.
6 International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility that is heightened when investing in emerging or frontier markets. Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. The risks of investing in emerging-market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies and even less developed capital markets or legal and political systems than traditional emerging market countries. As a result, the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier market countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall.
7 Financial professional refers to Premier Wealth Advisors (PWA), Premier Relationship Advisors (PRA) and Financial Advisors (FA).  PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.  Both offer bank products through HSBC Bank (USA) N.A., investments and certain insurance products, including annuities, through HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and traditional insurance products through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc.
8 HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research  team is a research and asset management capability utilized by certain HSBC companies in various regions around the world. In the U.S. the company offering these capabilities is HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc.
United States persons (including U.S. citizens and residents) are subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their U.S. and non–U.S. accounts – including, for example, Form TD F 90–22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ("FBAR")). U.S. persons should consult a tax adviser for more information.

Equities and ETFs








What are ETFs and Equities?

Equities1 represent ownership stakes in corporations. Typical equities may include common stock, preferred stock, foreign equities and closed-end funds.
An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a collection of securities such as equities, bonds, and options that is bought and sold like a stock in real time on a stock exchange. Most ETFs are not actively managed, but instead are designed to track an index. In general the expense ratios of ETFs are relatively low. Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value (NAV) calculated every day like a mutual fund does. 
Both equities and ETFs can offer potential growth from market price appreciation; however, they are subject to market volatility and thus, open to market price risk and potential loss of principal.
Exchange-traded funds are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility such that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF but must be bought and sold on an exchange, like an indivudual equity.  ETFs are sold by prospectus.  Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Advisor or call 888-525-5757.  Read it carefully before you invest.
Ready to invest?
Before you invest in equities or ETFs, it's important to weigh the risks against the potential returns and carefully plan your strategy. In addition to utilizing the knowledge and support of your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. financial professional2, you can leverage unique insights and analysis from HSBC Securities vast global resources to help you evaluate your investment possibilities. Get started with a comprehensive financial review by calling us at 866.586.4722 or by 
      scheduling a consultation online.
