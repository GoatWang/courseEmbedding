This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Key 
							Benefits



Allows plants to absorb and 
								maintain calcium in those parts of the plant 
								that suffer from symptoms of calcium deficiency, 
								particularly the fruit, such as Blossom End Rot 
								(BER), internal browning, bitter pit, tip burn, 
								and black heart.


Gives better 
								cellular wall structure, improving the size, 
								quality, homogeneity and colour of fruit and 
								produce.


Helps plants 
								effectively use calcium while under stress 
								caused by poor environmental conditions, such as 
								temperature extremes, excess or limited water, 
								poor or high light conditions and salinity that 
								would normally lead to flower/fruit loss.


Avoids physiological 
								disorders


Improves growth 
								under environmental stress conditions 



Improves fruit shape 
								and homogeneity of the crop


Formation and 
								maintenance of a higher number of flowers and 
								fruits


Better firmness, 
								quality and shelf-life of the harvested product


Improves plant 
								tissue resistance to fungal pathogens


Easy application. 
								Optimized formulation makes it a perfect partner 
								for tank mixing












							eNrich**
 


eNrich 
							– a plant growth promoting inoculant incorporating 
							N-fixing and P-solubilizing microbes.

Key 
							Benefits




								Increased nitrogen & phosphate efficiency



								Improved fertilizer uptake



								Improved plant structure



								Potential to increase yields or reduce synthetic 
								N application rates

							Cytokinins (0,025 mg/L)


A 
							unique combination of Kelpak and micro-elements, for 
							high plant growth and yields. It does not contain N, 
							P, K.

Kelpak 
							is derived from the seaweed species, Kelp and is a 
							natural source of Auxins and Cytokinins, a group of 
							plant growth bio-regulators that have proven to have 
							a number of physiological effects on plants. 


Auxins 
							and Cytokinins are important to division of plant 
							cells, so assisting with root elongation and 
							development.
