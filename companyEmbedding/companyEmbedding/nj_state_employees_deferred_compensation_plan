DEFERRED COMPENSATION
The New Jersey State Employees Deferred 
                    Compensation Plan (NJSEDCP) provides you, as an eligible state 
                    employee, an opportunity to voluntarily shelter a portion 
                    of your wages from federal income taxes while saving for retirement 
                    to supplement your Social Security and pension benefits. Under 
                    the Plan, federal income tax is not due on deferred amounts 
                    or accumulated earnings until you receive a distribution (payment) 
                    from your account. Presumably, distribution is at retirement 
                    when your tax rate is expected to be lower.
MANAGING YOUR INVESTMENTS
As a participant in the NJSEDCP, you have 
                    the ability to make changes on your account such as increase, 
                    decrease, suspend, or resume deferral percentages. You may 
                    also change your investment elections to any of the 20 pre-approved 
                    products offered under Prudential. 
Effective July 31, 2014 the Bond Fund and Money Market Fund, representing two of the four State-managed investments were eliminated. The assets of the DCP Bond fund were mapped to the Core Plus Bond PIMCO Fund. On December 15, 2015, the Core Plus Bond PIMCO Fund assets were mapped to the Core Bond Plus/PIM Fund. The assets in the existing DCP Money Market fund were mapped to the Stable Value Fund and the DCP Equity Fund were opened to accept new contributions and investment transfers. 
Participants with balances 
                    remaining in the  State-managed investment funds (DCP 
                    Equity and Small Cap Equity) may transfer all 
                    or a portion of those investment balances among any of the 20 funds on 
                    a daily basis. 
PLAN ADMINISTRATION
The NJSEDCP, governed by the guidelines 
                    of Internal Revenue Code Section 457 and the laws of the State 
                    of New Jersey, is administered by Prudential 
                    Financial for the State of New Jersey. Individual participant's 
                    accounts are maintained by the Administrator and statements 
                    of account are furnished quarterly. All plan expenses are 
                    borne by the participants and notification of administrative 
                    fees is provided at enrollment. The Deferred Compensation 
                    Board is the final authority on all matters concerning the 
                    operation of the Plan and by law, the State Investment Council 
                    has the right to supervise certain aspects of the Plan including 
                    the investment of assets.
ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT
To enroll in the NJSEDCP, you must be employed 
                    by the State of New Jersey or an eligible agency, authority, 
                    commission, or instrumentality of state government.
If you are employed through a county, township, 
                    or municipality and not paid directly by the State of New 
                    Jersey or one of its agencies, you are NOT eligible for the 
                    NJSEDCP.
HOW TO ENROLL
You can obtain an enrollment package from 
                    your Human Resource or Personnel Representative or enroll 
                    by contacting Prudential Retirements directly at 1-866-NJSEDCP 
                    (1-866-657-3327  a TDD line is also available at: 1-877-760-5166) 
                    or over the Internet at: www.prudential.com/njsedcp
Upon enrollment, you agree that your deferrals 
                    and any earnings will be held in trust for you and your beneficiaries 
                    and will be paid to you following severance of employment. 
                    You may defer between 1% and 100% of your salary (minus your 
                    tax-sheltered pension or other voluntary tax-sheltered contributions) 
                    with an annual dollar maximum in 2016 of $18,000 ($24,000 
                    for individuals age 50 and older). You then choose how you 
                    want to invest among the 20 investment funds now offered through 
                    Prudential Financial.
 
DISTRIBUTION OF YOUR MONEY FROM THE PLAN
Your Deferred Compensation Plan account 
                    may be distributed following severance of employment due to 
                    termination, retirement, or disability. Distribution is also 
                    permitted in the case of an unforeseeable financial hardship, 
                    as defined under Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code, 
                    following approval by the Deferred Compensation Board. In-service 
                    distributions are permitted on smaller, inactive accounts.
If your account balance is less than $5,000 
                    at the time of distribution as a result of severance of employment, 
                    you must take a lump-sum payment.
If your account balance is $5,000 or more, 
                    you may elect:

 1. A one-time lump-sum 
                      payment;
 2. A portion of your account 
                      in a specific dollar amount; or
 3. Periodic installment payments.

Upon severance of employment, you may begin 
                    your account distribution as soon as administratively feasible, 
                    you may elect a future distribution date, or you may do nothing. 
                    However, you must begin receiving distribution no later than 
                    March of the year following your attainment of age 70 1/2, 
                    or the year of employment termination whichever is later. 
                    For daily valued funds, your account will be valued at the 
                    close of the day prior to your distribution date. For monthly 
                    valued funds, your account will be valued at the close of 
                    the month prior to your election for payment. A Distribution 
                    Request form must be completed and returned to the Plan office.
TAX CONSEQUENCES
The New Jersey State Employees Deferred 
                    Compensation Plan is an eligible state deferred compensation 
                    plan under Section 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. Distributions 
                    from the Plan may be eligible for rollover, however, distributions 
                    do not qualify for special 5-year or 10-year averaging. Distributions 
                    are defined as pension payments and are subject to federal 
                    income tax unless rolled over to another retirement plan.
IF YOU DIE BEFORE DISTRIBUTION IS COMPLETE
At the time of your death, your executor, 
                    beneficiary, or a family member should contact Prudential 
                    at 1-866-NJSEDCP. Your beneficiary will be notified of the 
                    options for account distribution. Your beneficiary will have 
                    the same distribution options available to members who terminate 
                    employment. However, the maximum period for periodic installment 
                    payments to non-spousal beneficiaries cannot exceed five years. 
                    Beneficiaries receiving distributions are subject to the same 
                    tax consequences as the original member.
