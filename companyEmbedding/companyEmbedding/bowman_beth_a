Top positive reviewSee all 8 positive reviews› 4.0 out of 5 starsA Great BeginningByDru Loveon November 15, 2012This great read features gutsy private investigator Beth Bowman who takes on a simple case but instead is accused of murder when a dead body is found near her unconscious state.  Trying to find the killer(s), Beth who knows her limitations, keeps on looking for clues until the job is done inherits a motley crew of back-up support that includes the mysterious Bob, Dr David and Dot.  The author did a good job in delivering a finely tuned mystery that entertained me from the first page to the explosive finale.  I loved how Beth handles the situations that she found herself in using her personal bravado. I can't wait to read the next exciting forays that Beth and her cohorts find themselves in, in this delightfully enjoyable debut series.

Top critical reviewSee the critical review› 3.0 out of 5 starsOrdinaryByJayeon March 24, 2013The writer stated his purpose to create an authentic female voice from a male writer.  While I admire the goal, he did not succeed.  This weakness became grating as the book moved along.  The plotting of the book had several clever and interesting pieces.  I read it very quickly but found nothing outstanding or memorable.
