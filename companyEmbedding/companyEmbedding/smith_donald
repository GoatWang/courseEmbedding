Where?My current locationSearchHomePhysicians & Surgeons near New York, NYDR Donald Smith Wood MD PCServicesDR Donald Smith Wood MD PC830 Park Ave, New York, NY 10021(212) 744-2224View Business DetailsServices"Fish and Chips" found in 1 dishPhysicians General PractitionersWeight ManagementWe also encourage patients who intend to lose a lot of weight to wait before undergoing the procedure, since skin in the abdominal area typically loosens after substantial weight loss.RadiologistUltrasoundWhile the conventional liposuction procedure was effective in removing excessive fat deposits, it was a painful procedure that involved suctioning out large areas of solid fat. New technology has allowed for different techniques that improve the accuracy and reduce the pain associated with this procedure. Today, liposuction is usually performed via the tumescent technique or with the help of ultrasound imaging or a laser. These new technologies have transformed liposuction into a much safer and less invasive procedure.SurgeonsGeneral SurgeryEar SurgeryEar surgery typically serves two functions: setting prominent ears back closer to the head, and reducing the size of large ears. Surgery may also be helpful for “lop ear,” “cupped ear” and “shell ear,” large or stretched earlobes, and lobes with large creases and wrinkles. Surgeons are also able to construct new ears for patients who are missing them from injury or other causes.Reconstructive SurgeryDr. Donald Wood-Smith is a board-certified plastic surgeon specializing in cosmetic plastic surgery. Dr. Wood-Smith’s prestigious medical society affiliations include membership in the American Association of Plastic Surgeons, the American Society of Aesthetic Plastics Surgeons (ASAPS), the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons, and the British Association of Plastic Surgeons. He holds the position of Professor of Clinical Plastic Surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and is Chairman of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the New York Eye & Ear Infirmary. He works closely with each patient to develop an individualized plan of treatment and is dedicated to helping you achieve a natural post-surgical look.Plastic SurgeonsBotoxBecause blepharoplasty cannot be used to raise the eyebrows or reduce the appearance of wrinkles, crow’s feet or dark circles under the eyes, the procedure is often combined with others such as a facelift and BOTOX® treatments.Brow LiftFurther, facelifts will not rejuvenate the brow, eyelids, nose, and some of the midface. Patients who want to improve these areas may consider combining a facelift with a brow lift or eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty).Eyelid SurgeryBlepharoplasty, also known as eyelid surgery, is a surgical procedure that improves the appearance of the upper and lower eyelids by tightening muscles and tissue or removing excess fat and skin. This procedure can be performed on men and women alike and offers a younger, more refreshed look that reflects across the whole face.LiposuctionLiposuction is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure used to remove localized areas of fat from the body through a small thin tube called a cannula. The fat from the targeted area is suctioned from the body through this tube to help patients achieve a slim and balanced appearance.Breast AugmentationOur patients elect to undergo breast augmentation for many different medical and aesthetic reasons, including balancing breast size, compensating for reduced breast mass after pregnancy or surgery, and correcting a congenital breast defect. Under our doctors’ expert care, patients enjoy great-looking, natural-feeling breasts that are one or more cup sizes larger after the operation.Breast ReductionThis procedure may be performed alone, or can be combined with other cosmetic procedures, such as a facelift, breast reduction or tummy tuck, to achieve maximum results.Breast LiftThe best candidates for breast lift are women whose breasts meet some or all of the following conditions...RhinoplastyChin surgery, also known as mentoplasty, is a surgical procedure to reshape the chin either by enhancement with an implant or reduction surgery on the bone. Although human beauty and attractiveness are generally subjective, there are some rules that dictate whether contours are aesthetic or not. In regards to the chin, these rules revolve around the positioning and prominence of the chin relative to the base of the nose. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a plastic surgeon to suggest supplementing a rhinoplasty with mentoplasty in order to ensure that an aesthetic balance is maintained.Plastic SurgeryDonald Wood-Smith, M.D. F.A.C.S., F.R.C.S., an internationally renowned Manhattan plastic surgeon, who specializes in surgery of the face, breast and body, has established offices in London and is now available to patients seeking the newest procedures in cosmetic enhancement. Wood-Smith notes; “cosmetic plastic surgery is an evolving art with new techniques emerging with great frequency each year.” Dr. Wood-Smith travels to Britain frequently where he consults with patients who he operates upon in New York.Face LiftThe way a facelift is performed varies depending on the surgeon, the patient’s facial structure, and the extent of correction desired. The three most common incision techniques are...Neck LiftNeck Lift: A neck lift concentrates on jowls, loose skin on the neck, and fat under the chin. The incision is made around the ear lobe and behind the ear to the lower scalp.BlepharoplastyThe best candidates for blepharoplasty are individuals who are in good overall health and who do not smoke or have any serious eye conditions. If you have loose, sagging skin or puffy bags around your eyes, this procedure can help reduce these unwanted effects and leave the eyes looking young and fresh.AbdominoplastyAbdominoplasty, often called a “tummy tuck,” is a very popular surgery in America. Tummy tucks help flatten and shape the abdomen and waist by removing excess fat and skin and tightening muscles. Our doctors have been performing abdominoplasties with excellent cosmetic results for many years. Patients love the look of their new flat stomachs after surgery under our doctors’ exceptional care.Nose SurgerySurgeons use one of two techniques when performing nose surgery. In a closed rhinoplasty, incisions are made within the nostrils. In an open rhinoplasty, the incision is made across the columella, the tissue between the nostrils. With both methods, the surgeon gently lifts the soft tissues covering the nose. He or she sculpts the bone and cartilage to the desired shape. Any additional cartilage needed to augment the nose can often be taken from the septum.OtoplastyScar RevisionPatients who have had previous abdominal surgery should know that their old scars could be raised, stretched or generally more noticeable after the procedure. A scar revision procedure after abdominoplasty may minimize the appearance of an unsightly scar.Laser ResurfacingWhen wrinkling around the eyes and mouth is the main complaint, laser resurfacing may obviate the need for a mini-facelift. According to Dr. Wood-Smith, however, it cannot replace it.Cosmetic SurgeryBreast augmentation is one of the most frequently performed cosmetic surgery procedures in the U.S. and one of our most popular services. Breast augmentation can give women with small or unevenly sized breasts a fuller, firmer, better-proportioned look through the placement of saline or silicone implants in the breast.Facial ImplantsForehead LiftGynecologistsPregnancyDermatologistsAcne TreatmentChemical PeelsChemical peels remove damaged outer layers of skin on the face to smooth texture, reduce scarring, and remove blemishes and pre-cancerous growths to produce healthy, glowing skin.PsychiatristsAnxietySend to PhoneDR Donald Smith Wood MD PC830 Park Ave, New York, NY 10021(212) 744-2224Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailDR Donald Smith Wood MD PC830 Park Ave, New York, NY 10021(212) 744-2224Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

        it was amazing



Outstanding. This book is packed with rules and tools to accelerate product development. Without a single direct reference to IT this book explains the essence of Agile and Lean in a buzzword free way.

Most of the time and risk is taken out of product development by investment in the "fuzzy" front end. The authors focus on this (often neglected)

If you're looking for a single sourcebook for a more efficient product development effort this one is worth it.
