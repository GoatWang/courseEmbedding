HMS Income Fund
  



HMS Income Fund: Created With You andAmerican Businesses in Mind.
Public offering expected to close to new investors on or about September 30, 2017.
HMS Income Fund is a public, non-traded business development company (BDC) that focuses on income and capital appreciation. The company’s strategy is to make debt investments in syndicated middle-market companies as well as self-originated debt and equity investments in lower middle-market companies.
HMS Income Fund taps the experience and resources of Main Street Capital Corporation (“Main Street”), a publicly-traded BDC (NYSE: MAIN), through MSC Adviser I, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that is the sub-adviser to the fund. The sub-adviser recommends and monitors all of HMS Income Fund’s investments, targeting investment opportunities that arise from ownership transitions, strategic acquisitions, business expansions and other growth initiatives, primarily for later stage businesses. Since its inception, Main Street has specialized in providing long-term loans and equity capital to middle-market and lower middle-market U.S. companies.
There are substantial costs associated with an investment in this offering. An investor must review the fees and expenses in the prospectus prior to investing.
Click here for information on sales charges, fees and expenses.
Please note: Investors are not acquiring an interest in Main Street.1There is no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions. The amount and timing of distributions are not guaranteed. Investment income has been insufficient to fund distributions due to the incentive fee on income, which the Adviser and Sub-Adviser have agreed to waive. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of distributions were paid from net realized income from operations (before the waiver of the incentive fee on income), 0.0% came from the waiver of the incentive fee on income, and 0.0% came from distributions in excess of net investment income, which represents adjustments made to GAAP basis net investment income to arrive at taxable income available for distributions. If the advisors had not agreed to waive their fees, these distributions would have come from investors' paid in capital. Paying distributions from sources other than net realized income lowers an investor's overall return. 
2Price effective as of the Company's January 19, 2017 weekly closing. Based upon the calculated NAV, the pricing committee reviews the offering price to ensure that shares are not being offered at a price, after deduction of selling commissions and dealer manager fees, below NAV per share. Periodic valuations will cause offering price to fluctuate.

Overview
 NOTE:  Hines Global REIT closed to new investors on April 11, 2014.



Hines Global REIT: Your passport to global real estate.® 



Hines Global REIT owns and manages a diversified real estate portfolio that includes office, multifamily, retail, industrial and other real estate investments in domestic and international markets. It was launched in August 2009 and has a portfolio of investments in 18 locations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Australia.3

Portfolio Summary4

Estimated aggregate value: $4.8 billionNumber of investments: 40 projects, 16.0 million square feetPercentage leased: 93%


16.5% annualized distribution rate is based on the $10.03 per share estimated NAV and assumes the daily distribution rate ($0.0017808 per share, per day) declared since January 2015 is maintained for one year.2Our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fully years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with cash flows from financing activities, which may include proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from our debt financings. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we paid $1.1 million and $22.0 million in acquisition fees and expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses were expensed and therefore reduced cash flows from operating activities. However, we funded these expenses with proceeds from our public offerings or other equity capital.3Data as of March 31, 2017.4Assumes 100% ownership in each of Hines Global REIT’s real estate assets and investments in real estate-related debt. We own less than 100% of the interests in three projects. Assuming the REIT’s effective ownership, the estimated aggregate value would be $4.8 billion; square feet would be 16.0 million and the percentage leased would be 93%.5Please see Hines Global REIT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017 for a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, as well as the limitations of the estimated per share NAV. The estimated per share NAV was calculated as of a moment in time, and, although the value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, developments related to individual assets, purchases and sales of additional assets and the payment of fees and closing costs in connection therewith, changes in the real estate and capital markets, the distribution of sales proceeds to Hines Global REIT’s stockholders (if any) and changes in corporate policies such as Hines Global REIT’s distribution level relative to earnings, Hines Global REIT does not undertake to update the estimated per share NAV on a regular basis. As a result, stockholders should not rely on the estimated per share NAV as an accurate measure of the then-current value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock in making a decision to buy or sell shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock, including whether to reinvest distributions by participating in Hines Global REIT’s distribution reinvestment plan and whether to request redemption under Hines Global REIT’s share redemption program. The estimated per share NAV is not a representation, warranty or guarantee that (i) a stockholder would be able to realize an amount equal to the estimated per share NAV if such stockholder attempts to sell the his or her shares; (ii) a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated per share NAV upon Hines Global REIT’s liquidation or sale; (iii) shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock would trade at the estimated per share NAV on a national securities exchange; or (iv) a third party would offer the estimated per share NAV in an arm’s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of Hines Global REIT’s shares of common stock.

REITs Overview
 Real estate is one of the oldest means by which individuals have accumulated and measured their wealth. In fact, there was once a time when real estate was considered the more "traditional" investment while stocks and bonds were thought of as “alternatives.” Today there are a number of ways to invest in real estate, and one that has grown exponentially in popularity is the non-traded real estate investment trust, or REIT.
REITs are specialized investments that pool the money of many investors to purchase real estate assets, primarily properties. REITs can focus on one property type, such as office, or include many different kinds of properties in a single portfolio. REITs can also vary in terms of their geographic focus—they can be regional, national or global in scope.
An investor’s return from a REIT investment may come from different sources depending on the REIT’s strategy. Typically, income from rents, minus expenses, is passed through to the REIT and, after paying other expenses of the REIT, is then distributed to shareholders. The REIT may also seek to grow the value of invested capital, providing additional return to investors in the event of a future liquidity event, such as a listing on an exchange, merger, or sale of REIT assets.
Remember that, like real estate, an investment in a non-traded REIT does not offer ready liquidity like you would find with stocks and bonds. Distributions from a REIT are not guaranteed, nor is growth in the value of invested capital. Future liquidity events are also not guaranteed. An investment in a non-traded REIT is subject to significant upfront and ongoing expenses which can reduce the amount available for an investment and reduce an investor's overall return.

Hines Global REIT Announces New Estimated NET Asset Value Per Share of $10.24


March 3, 2016




(HOUSTON) – Hines, the international real estate firm, announced today that the Board of Directors of Hines Global REIT, Inc. (“Hines Global REIT” or “the Company”) has established a new estimated net asset value (“NAV”) per share of $10.241 as of December 31, 2015, a net increase of approximately 8.5% over its last valuation of $9.44 per share as of December 31, 2014. Hines Global REIT is a diversified real estate investment trust sponsored by Hines that, as of December 31, 2015, holds a portfolio of 43 high-quality core assets that is 96% occupied and valued at approximately $5.5 billion2.“We are extremely pleased with the continued strong performance of the Company’s high-quality and well-diversified portfolio,” said Sherri Schugart, the Company’s President and chief executive officer. Hines Global REIT’s portfolio -- 62% located in the United States, with the remainder in Great Britain, Germany, France, Australia, Poland and Russia – consists of 16.9 million square feet of office, retail, industrial, mixed-use and multifamily assets as of December 31, 2015.Schugart attributed the bulk of the share price increase to a 9.9% rise in the value of the Company’s real estate holdings during 2015, offset by reductions to reflect the continued devaluation of the Euro, Australian dollar and British pound against the U.S. dollar as well as estimated closing costs related to a potential future liquidity event. Schugart added, “As the Company gets closer to consideration of a potential liquidity event3, management and the board of directors thought it appropriate to include an estimate of the closing costs in determining the new estimated NAV per share.”Hines Global REIT used the same third-party valuation firms as it has in prior years. Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. provided MAI appraised values of every domestic asset, while Knight Frank, LLP provided appraised values of every international asset. Debt was valued by Jones Lang LaSalle while Cushman & Wakefield also provided a reasonableness opinion on the estimated NAV per share.About HinesHines is a privately owned global real estate investment firm founded in 1957 with a presence in 199 cities in 19 countries. Hines has $87 billion of assets under management, including $43 billion for which Hines provides fiduciary investment management services, and $44 billion for which Hines provides third-party property-level services. The firm has 104 developments currently underway around the world. Historically, Hines has developed, redeveloped or acquired 1,100 properties, totaling over 346 million square feet. The firm’s current property and asset management portfolio includes 531 properties, representing over 186 million square feet. With extensive experience in investments across the risk spectrum and all property types, and a pioneering commitment to sustainability, Hines is one of the largest and most-respected real estate organizations in the world. Visit www.hines.com for more information.Forward-Looking StatementsStatements in this press release, including intentions, beliefs, expectations or projections relating to the estimated NAV per share and the estimates related to a potential future liquidity event, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, beliefs and assumptions that involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, Hines Global REIT’s ability to maintain occupancy levels and lease rates at its properties, Hines Global REIT’s ability to repay or successfully refinance its debt obligations, the future operating performance of Hines Global REIT’s investments, Hines Global REIT’s estimate of closing costs that Hines Global REIT would expect to incur in relation to a future potential liquidity event, and those risks set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of Hines Global REIT’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, as amended or supplemented by Hines Global REIT’s other filings with the SEC. Although these forward-looking statements reflect management’s belief as to future events, actual events or Hines Global REIT’s investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. To the extent that Hines Global REIT’s assumptions differ from actual results, Hines Global REIT’s ability to meet such forward-looking statements may be significantly hindered. Stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.1The estimated NAV per share is not a representation, warranty or guarantee that (i) a stockholder would be able to realize an amount equal to the estimated NAV per share if such stockholder attempts to sell his or her shares; (ii) a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated NAV per share upon the Company’s liquidation or sale; (iii) shares of the Company’s common stock would trade at the estimated NAV per share on a national securities exchange or (iv) a third party would offer the estimated NAV per share in an arm’s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of the Company’s shares of common stock. The estimated NAV per share was calculated as of a moment in time, and although the value of Hines Global REIT’s common shares will fluctuate over time, the Company does not undertake to update the estimated NAV per share on a regular basis. As a result, stockholders should not rely on the estimated NAV per share as being an accurate measure of the then-current value of their shares in making a decision to buy or sell their shares, including whether to reinvest distributions by participating in the distribution reinvestment plan and whether to request redemption under Hines Global REIT’s share redemption program. See the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016 for a description of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the estimated NAV per share, as well as the limitations of the estimated NAV per share.2Assumes 100% ownership in each of Hines Global REIT’s real estate assets and investments in real estate-related debt. We own less than 100% of the interests in five projects. Assuming the REIT’s effective ownership, the estimated aggregate value would be $5.3 billion; square feet would be 16.5 million and the percentage leased would be 96%.3There can be no assurances of the time frame in which the Company would execute any potential liquidity event or that the closing costs related to such an event would be incurred in the amount estimated by the Company.NY 245694878v1

NEW HINES GLOBAL REIT ANNOUNCED
$3.5 Billion Offering Targets Individual Investors


August 13, 2009




(HOUSTON) – Hines, the international real estate firm, announced today the commencement of the initial public offering of Hines Global REIT, a public non-traded real estate investment trust. The company seeks to raise a maximum of $3.5 billion in the offering.

We think Hines Global REIT will benefit from the expertise of our many offices and tenured employees in 17 countries on four continents.”

We plan to make strategic acquisitions and dispositions, and will be seeking out undervalued assets as well as aggressively pursuing opportunities in markets around the world, which may offer additional diversification as well as attractive risk-adjusted returns.
With Hines as our sponsor, we will have the advantage of tenure and expertise in developed markets, as well as in emerging markets such as Brazil, China, Russia, Poland and India.”

Overview
The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview
 NOTE:  Hines Global REIT closed to new investors on April 11, 2014.



Hines Global REIT: Your passport to global real estate.® 



Hines Global REIT owns and manages a diversified real estate portfolio that includes office, multifamily, retail, industrial and other real estate investments in domestic and international markets. It was launched in August 2009 and has a portfolio of investments in 18 locations in the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Russia and Australia.3

Portfolio Summary4

Estimated aggregate value: $4.8 billionNumber of investments: 40 projects, 16.0 million square feetPercentage leased: 93%


16.5% annualized distribution rate is based on the $10.03 per share estimated NAV and assumes the daily distribution rate ($0.0017808 per share, per day) declared since January 2015 is maintained for one year.2Our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fully years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with cash flows from financing activities, which may include proceeds from our public offerings and proceeds from our debt financings. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, we paid $1.1 million and $22.0 million in acquisition fees and expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and acquisition-related expenses were expensed and therefore reduced cash flows from operating activities. However, we funded these expenses with proceeds from our public offerings or other equity capital.3Data as of March 31, 2017.4Assumes 100% ownership in each of Hines Global REIT’s real estate assets and investments in real estate-related debt. We own less than 100% of the interests in three projects. Assuming the REIT’s effective ownership, the estimated aggregate value would be $4.8 billion; square feet would be 16.0 million and the percentage leased would be 93%.5Please see Hines Global REIT’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017 for a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to determine the estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, as well as the limitations of the estimated per share NAV. The estimated per share NAV was calculated as of a moment in time, and, although the value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock will fluctuate over time as a result of, among other things, developments related to individual assets, purchases and sales of additional assets and the payment of fees and closing costs in connection therewith, changes in the real estate and capital markets, the distribution of sales proceeds to Hines Global REIT’s stockholders (if any) and changes in corporate policies such as Hines Global REIT’s distribution level relative to earnings, Hines Global REIT does not undertake to update the estimated per share NAV on a regular basis. As a result, stockholders should not rely on the estimated per share NAV as an accurate measure of the then-current value of shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock in making a decision to buy or sell shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock, including whether to reinvest distributions by participating in Hines Global REIT’s distribution reinvestment plan and whether to request redemption under Hines Global REIT’s share redemption program. The estimated per share NAV is not a representation, warranty or guarantee that (i) a stockholder would be able to realize an amount equal to the estimated per share NAV if such stockholder attempts to sell the his or her shares; (ii) a stockholder would ultimately realize distributions per share equal to the estimated per share NAV upon Hines Global REIT’s liquidation or sale; (iii) shares of Hines Global REIT’s common stock would trade at the estimated per share NAV on a national securities exchange; or (iv) a third party would offer the estimated per share NAV in an arm’s-length transaction to purchase all or substantially all of Hines Global REIT’s shares of common stock.
