..... Power to the data-poor Ry Walker of Astronomer makes the argument that many companies who need enterprise integration are far better served by a package of SaaS + custom work by humans, departing from the trend in the space that has focused on self-service due to the VC preference for scaling purely on software. Machines + Humans = Future of SaaS Jonathan Golden of Airbnb writes about how flexibility can help push products forward, by allowing managers to reimagine solutions.

This watch is very comfortable, it's not to heavy and it doesn't slide around to much.BEST PURCHASE YET !!!Great purchase ! In love with the product and amazed at how fast it was shipped to me. Beautiful watch; You will love it.I bought the watch for my husband for Father's Day!  He loved!  He took it to a jewelry store to get two links removed to make it fit better.  The watch is definitely not an everyday watch, but for special occasion.  I also bought him another JBW watch from another website; that one he wears daily.  JBW makes fabulous watches and Overstock makes it affordable!  Keep quality products coming!!!!positiveNot what I expected but will serve a purpose. The picture made the watch appear to be of better style and quality than actual product.Sai Good product .... And a nice deal.... Really worth buying it Great ProductI have been anticipating this product for about 6 yrs now finally got the product. I love the style. I would recommend Johnson and Son watches to watch buyers.Swiss MasterpieceThis is my first Edox, but, based on this beauty, it won't be my last.  

I have a wide range of watches, from world-renowned models from affordable brands like Citizen and Seiko on up through to Hamilton, Tissot, Raymond Weil, Maurice LaCroix and so on, and, while I don't claim to be any kind of expert, I do know enough to know what makes a "good" watch worth it.  While some highly upscale brands are really a complete waste of money (unless for use of bragging, for those that find such to be useful) based on providing nothing more in quality than pieces twenty times less in price, there are some decent finds in and around a range from $500 to $2500 that are "worth it" in some brands, despite the fact that, for much less than that, you can also get what that price range provides, in terms of movement, materials and styling.  The difference in the higher priced versions may be subtle, but generally you are getting a better movement, higher grade of materials and finishing of the details, and the heritage behind a more established and respected brand (which can often equate to better service, in the event servicing is ever needed, plus more recognition/respect among peers, if that matters at all).

While I initially viewed Edox watches as overpriced, researching the brand changed my mind.  It's just not as well known, at all really, in the States, but it is a well-respected and well-established brand overseas, and is actually quite a prize to have on your wrist.  Because of that prestige, yes, you are paying more for the brand factor, but not nearly as much as you would pay for other brands where far. far more is being spent on the brand name itself, than on what you're actually buying, and receiving, in terms of a watch.  

The "branding" element may push the price here, slightly, but this model proves it's definitely getting you more, plus, this is where smart buying, like here on Overstock, cuts out much of that cost, meaning you are getting a prestige watch on a "regular joe" budget (and who needs to know, but you).  

So, what are you getting?  Well, as I say, there is the prestigious Edox name, but this is a case where the brand delivers much, much more, than just a name.  

The rubber strap, with deployment clasp, is pure silk.  It is incredibly comfortable.  For me, I was specifically looking for a square case to add to my watch collection, since I own very few, and it is always a different look than just the same round styling over and over again.  The sizing here is perfect, not just for comfort, but for showing wrist presence without appearing gaudy or crass.  A genuine Swiss quartz heart beats inside, with a very unique "retrograde" movement, where, for the chronograph, the lower hand sweeps and re-sets to count thirty second intervals, which then triggers the minute hand to count and then reset five minute periods, which then triggers the hour hand to jump forward five minutes at a time, up to one hour of timing.  It's one of the most unique chronograph counters I've seen, it's a wonder to just sit and watch it work, and I really like different movements, such as this one, which set the watch apart as something quite special.  Water resistance is 50m, appropriate and actually quite good for a luxury watch, meaning you can get it wet without worries, but it's not meant for serious underwater time, obviously.    

In terms of the crystal, I can't anywhere confirm Overstock's description of "mineral glass" coated with sapphire -- every other listing shows this as a true sapphire crystal, with anti-reflective coating, which it appears to be, so it seems Overstock is wrong here.  Lume is very strong on this piece, and is generously applied, giving it a terrific and readable glow in the dark.

Beyond just the great feel, and special movement, the styling is stellar.  In this edition of gold and black with white highlighting on the indices, the final result is mesmerizing and beautiful to behold.  I have a lot of nice looking watches, but this is the best of them all.  This easily rivals custom limited edition pieces paraded around on the pages of Robb Report or other luxury lifestyle publications, but instead of shelling out hundreds of thousands, this amazing watch only runs a few thousand at retail prices, and here is just under $500, which is a staggeringly great deal frankly.  

I likely would have saved up and sprung for this at a thousand or more, just because it's such a gorgeous watch, but at the cost here, I ordered it the moment I found it.  This is truly a deal of epic magnitude, to get this watch for this price.

In person, it is just somewhat jaw dropping, and, if you're looking to enter the world of high end Swiss watches, there could be no better point of entry.  You'll outshine everyone else at the luxury watch table, and only you need to know that you only spent hundreds, instead of tens of thousands, for your treasure.  

The details and finishing on this watch are absolutely top notch, and this is just a huge step beyond any of the usual "affordable" Swiss lines, giving you a truly elite time piece that, honestly, is far more compelling even than what is considered to be "higher end" Swiss brands (which, while rich in brand recognition, tend to honestly just look pretty boring in terms of styling).  

This is a watch set apart, for sure, and it will set you apart in your ownership of it.  Cousins of this variant ran as high as $15,000 for a chiming minute repeater version, $4,000 for the automatic model, and even this quartz one, elsewhere, usually starts at double what it's going for here, so this is definitely an impressive time keeper and I'd encourage you to get it, not just for the incredible deal, but also because it is now out of production, so eventually they will be gone.

This one has certainly sold me on the Edox brand.  Research is one thing, but seeing and wearing this, in person, has convinced me that Edox is a rare find, providing, for only several thousand dollars (or much less, here) the kind of watches that ordinarily can cost as much as a car, or even a house.  I can't recommend this more highly and, frankly, for those seeking a square case, I'd go as far as to say this is one of the best versions made.  If you want to make a statement of elite quality, this Classe Royale says it all.

 Great WatchThis was my first purchase off OS.com and of a Stuhrling watch. I am happy to say that the watch I received in the mail looked much better than the images on the site, they just don't convey the beauty of the piece. I waited over a month before I wrote this because I wanted to be able to give an accurate review of the product. As I stated above the images do not accurately convey the true esthetics of the piece.The watch is rather large and takes some getting use to. Since it is automatic, if it is not wore daily it will stop. That being said I do not wear it overnight and it keeps time fine overnight w/o stopping or slowing down. The downsides, there were and are a couple very small gold flakes loose under the glass. Also, on the face there is a small rough patch that looks unpolished. That being said, both issues are only noticeable when looking very closely at the watch and probably aren't present on all pieces. I paid about $$$ for the watch, I noticed the price at the moment is about $$$. I don't know if the price went down because of the Holidays but I would say take advantage of the low price it is well worth it. Recommendation: BuySponsored LinksWhat's This?

SaveJonathan Golden, Airbnb’s very first product manager and now Director of Product, knows that flexibility can get you far in his line of work. Last year, it even got him to Cuba.While the island nation had always been effectively closed to Airbnb, the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the U.S. in 2015 opened a door — a door the company’s leaders wanted to walk through quickly. “We thought it was important to incorporate that community into the world and into the Airbnb ecosystem,” says Golden.Any number of Airbnb teams could have added the Cuba project to their existing workload, but given the unique challenges of entering the highly restricted market and managing money transfers, that would have taken too long. So the decision was made to build a new, dedicated team, which landed in the Payments organization that Golden helms.In 10 weeks, a cross-functional team — product managers, designers, engineers, and data scientists reallocated from elsewhere in the org — was assembled. There was extensive support from other areas of the company including legal, operations and comms. It was a herculean task for everyone who worked cross-functionally. But two months later, the initial infrastructure was up and running in Cuba. And almost as quickly as it formed, the team was disbanded, with the ongoing work of maintaining Cuban business doled out to existing product areas.An unusual case? Maybe. But it’s emblematic of the elastic, vision-driven product management approach that has allowed Airbnb to reimagine travel. In this exclusive interview, Golden describes how to build high-impact, modular teams driven by actual needs. He walks through the decision-making framework that he uses to allocate the hottest of commodities: engineers. And he explains why — when everyone is working toward a clear company objective — having teams that expand and contract actually keeps you aligned.STEP 1: Make sure your vision is fully articulatedIf Golden could share just one organizing principle, it would be this: Design your product teams around outcomes, not features.This is where defining a clear vision comes in. Too many teams skip this step because they want to get to the concrete work and not waste their time with touchy-feely goal-setting. When you do this, you end up wasting a lot more time.“A lot of people call me and ask how they should structure their product organizations. I always tell them to do it based on outcome. If you do it based on features, then you’re going to be perpetuating those features whether they’re useful or not.” Your company vision is what you want the world to look like in five-plus years — outcomes are the team mandates that will help you get there. “Outcomes define what we want to achieve for people in our community,” says Golden. (More context on this later.)Your product vision and the team outcomes it spins out aren’t pie-in-the-sky talk reserved for board meetings and investor pitches. It’s as important to your company’s day-to-day functioning as your site metrics or revenue — and like those numbers, you should communicate it clearly and often.For example, Airbnb’s vision for the Payments team is to “create a world where connections between people become less transactional and more human.” By bringing the transactional element of payment between guests and hosts online, the team makes the process as seamless as possible and allows the community to engage in more meaningful ways. But this is a challenge that’s ongoing — Golden knows there’s more to do to achieve this greater objective. In the meantime, the more immediate mission is a helpful tool: “To build an accurate and extensible global payments platform that provides a frictionless experience for guests, hosts and partners.”That’s not to say that you need to identify a vision that will take your company all the way from series A to IPO. Frankly, you probably couldn’t if you wanted to. Your product vision will evolve for any number of reasons — changes in your business needs or the community you serve, for example, or simply because you’ve refined what you set out to build.The excitement of a consumer technology startup is that the business and environment around you is changing so fast, you must respond in kind.Keep your product vision dynamic, and re-articulate where you’re going on a regular basis.“I’m sure Mark Zuckerberg, in the early days, didn’t think Facebook was going to be as big as it is today,” Golden says. “Now they’re able to think so much more expansively about connecting the world in a very meaningful way. But they’ve only achieved that because they were able to slowly expand that vision as they moved forward through a number of outcomes.”Golden advises founders to focus initially on the things that are working and grow into their product vision organically. “I’ve seen company scope expand too quickly,” he says. “Normally if something is working and you double down on that, then whatever you are measuring will dramatically accelerate. If something is only half working and you need to go do something else to achieve your goal, then maybe it really wasn’t working as well as you had thought.”STEP 2: Build modular teams for maximum flexibilityAirbnb optimizes for agility first and foremost by assembling interdisciplinary product teams. The notion of a group of product managers sitting together in a bullpen apart from the rest of the organization is anathema. Instead, product managers are matched with engineers, designers, and data scientists to attack business problems from all sides.If people collaborating on the same project are disjointed or they’re not always interacting, then a lot of the magic of creativity is going to get lost.This modular team structure is how Airbnb has managed to keep the spirit of an early-stage startup as it’s grown into a tech giant. “In the early days, we used to have one big meeting, with all of engineering, all of design, all of data science, and all of product management in one room. Of course, at the time that was maybe 20 people,” says Golden. “We’ve evolved from there, but we kept the core of how the team operated.”There’s no feeling of rank within each team and no room for prima donnas. “Everybody has the same ownership of impact across data, design, engineering, and product. ” If a team needs to communicate something to the rest of the company, it selects the appropriate lead — a data scientist, for example, would communicate the results of a major A/B experiment. “It’s a team that operates cohesively, versus one person who’s potentially more of a totalitarian leader.”STEP 3: Hire These 3 Types of PMs — You’ll Need Them AllWhile building modular product teams, startups also need to staff for their stage. When you’re pushing toward product/market fit, you’ll need a very different “type” of PM than when you’re scaling or, later, when you achieve scale and move on to platform initiatives. Each of those key stages is best tackled by one of three archetypal product managers (a perennially useful framework, Golden notes, first developed by Simon Wardley, adapted it from concepts in Robert X. Cringely’s 1992 book Accidental Empires):PioneersThese are people who are excited by building prototypes, who are pumped about the riskiness of the endeavor and when creating something brand new in the world,” says Golden. Sound a lot like a founder? That’s not a coincidence; founders are typically their companies’ first product person — the ultimate pioneer. But whether you bring it to the table yourself or hire for it, this is the type of PM energy a company needs at the start.How to spot them: These risk-taking front-liners need to be scrappy, so look for someone who has entrepreneurial experience already. That might be someone who was CEO of his or her own company, or even a PM who led an exploratory team for a large company (the lead for a new product area at Google, for example). Don’t, however, assume that any startup experience equals pioneer experience. “There is a huge difference between somebody who has built something and somebody who has maintained something,” says Golden.Here are the questions he recommends asking to determine if a product manager has pioneer potential: What is your process for uncovering user needs? How do you know if you’ve achieved product market fit? Tell me a time when you did something non-scalable to jumpstart a product. I’m thinking about building “X” — what do you do to get it built in 10 days?For each of these questions, you’re looking for responses that are both thoughtful and concise. Beware candidates who talk in circles or provide a lot of unnecessary context. They should have a clear sense of what they’d say in each situation and be able to communicate it clearly. And their explanations should dovetail with the cadence, speed and culture of your company.SettlersOnce you achieve product-market fit, your focus needs to shift from starting a company to building one. And to scale, you need settlers. “These product managers are much more focused on impact. They really care about reaching a lot of people. That’s a slightly different makeup; they’re obsessed with growth, they’re obsessed with optimizing.”Settlers can come from a variety of backgrounds. Most times they are highly analytical and have an uncanny ability to work hand in hand with data science. Large consumer internet companies have many settlers who work on refining and optimizing product experiences.How to spot them: Look for someone who finds the creativity in A/B testing, someone who’s driven by metrics and can tell you exactly how they’d measure the impact of a new feature.Here are the other questions Golden recommends asking to determine if a product manager is a natural settler: How would you break down our conversion funnel? How do you like to set up an A/B test? We have a feature “X” — what is the use case for the feature and how would you measure it? Tell me about a time you influenced user behavior through product?Town PlannersThese are your platform managers, who take over when it’s time to build the infrastructure and systems necessary to handle scale and accommodate your product’s use cases, current and future.Good town planners are also entrepreneurs. Many town planners have technical backgrounds but that is not a hard requirement. They can also work with technical visionaries where the product manager can steer the vision to realize its practicality for the broader product team. At Airbnb, they added product management support to the core infrastructure teams to help them build technical tools to set the business up for scale through the next few years.How to spot them: “Town planners must be able to synthesize large amounts of disparate information to build technology that will service existing and unanticipated use cases,” says Golden. Don’t just look for workhorses who can lay down a solid backend foundation—these PMs also need a vision for the future product initiatives that foundation could support.Here’s what to ask to figure out if someone has the capacity to be a town planner: What metric would you measure to determine success for a platform product? Tell me about a time when you built a system that supported a variety of use cases. How do you balance building toward known cases versus unknown future use cases? How do you know i the platform is too rigid or too flexible?A brand-new enterprise needs to know when to bring on the next wave of product management. But even in an established company, all three types of product managers are critical. “The product team needs each of these PMs to be nimble and responsive. Otherwise the business won’t endure for the long term,” says Golden. “We allocate product resources across three main categories: core initiatives that focus on the existing product, new initiatives that explore possible areas of growth for the business, and platform initiatives that focus on building fundamental technological infrastructure.” Pioneers and settlers don’t become obsolete just because you’re at scale.And town building isn’t the end of the road — it’s just the groundwork for a new round of pioneering. Golden’s Payments team, for example, is primarily tasked with building a platform. But since the exchange of funds touches everything the company does, his team also contributes to many of Airbnb’s new guest and host conversations. “We’re always thinking, ‘Okay, how do we take the system that we’ve built, which is moving a lot of money around the world right now, to think about where the business is going?’”Done right, the work of these three types of PMs forms a loop that makes the difference between a billion-dollar company and a one-hit wonder.STEP 4: Demystify resourcing projects with clear process“A product team needs to evolve with the product, how people use the product, and environment around the business,” says Golden. “It needs to have a culture of constant change.” But how do you know when it’s time to effect that change? For that, you’ll need one more building block: A consistent framework for setting and measuring goals. Because without a process for testing hypotheses, you may quickly find that you’re not so much iterating as spinning your wheels.For Golden and product leadership at Airbnb, that process looks something like this:By the time you reach the bottom of this flowchart, resourcing decisions may not be easy, but they’ll be clearer.“Everybody always wants more resources,” says Golden. “For the most part, nobody is saying ‘I’m fine, I don’t need to grow.’ People feel like their work can be contributing to the product, to the community, and in a high-growth company that’s usually true.” Product managers, then, need to work with founders and other company leaders to establish priorities.It’s very much a PM’s role to decide which bets to place.Working through this process chart, though, is not a one-and-done proposition. “You need to constantly revisit and challenge core fundamental assumptions to make sure that you’re making the right decisions based on what we know as factual today,” says Golden.Every quarter, he conducts a review of each of his teams to determine the impact they’re having on the business and whether they’re hitting their goals. “We say, ‘Okay, if this team is established and we’ve articulated all our goals and we didn’t hit one — or for some reason something is off — why are we off? What happened?’” Once again, he starts at the top of the chart. “The first question is ‘Did this product or project actually fit into the product vision?’ Usually it does, but other times we’ve had to be uncomfortably honest.”Take Airbnb’s Wish List feature, for example, which was originally conceived as a single-user “favorites” tool. “But most trips on Airbnb have more than one person and once it was in use, we saw that we weren’t actually addressing the real need, which was for sharing favorites and choosing the best place to stay as a group,” says Golden.By the time the tool was relaunched this year, the product vision had been torn down and rebuilt. “We had to take a step back to say, ‘Okay, is this actually what we want the product to be? Does it change our people’s behavior in a positive way?’” Armed with a new product vision, one informed by data, the team reinvented Wish List as a collaborative tool for planning trips (and saw a significant jump in usage).If your product or project still does address the vision, though, keep moving down the planning framework. “At the end of the day, if you realize that a project isn’t succeeding purely because your metric isn’t hitting the goal, normally the culprit is resourcing,” says Golden. And that’s a clear cue to look at re-aligning the team’s resources.STEP 5: Rally teams quickly and scrap them when necessary“If you have a culture of iteration, and a team that is flexible and includes a balance of the three types of product managers, then realignment is expected every so often. It’s not controversial,” says Golden.Whether you’ve identified a team that’s understaffed, have surfaced new problems that can’t be addressed by existing teams, or want to double down on a nascent opportunity, don’t shy away from moving people where they’ll be most valuable.Take internationalization, for example. Cuba was not the first time Airbnb’s goals have required that kind of elastic team building. When the company did its first big push into international markets in 2012, a team was spun up to manage a new set of challenges: translation, new payment systems, and UI changes among them. And as with Cuba, once those systems and platforms were in place, the tasks of maintaining them were once again distributed across the rest of the organization.Today, the company is reassembling an internationalization team to tackle its latest new markets. “The team has moved from 2012’s translation and content localization to developing deeper more culturally localized product experiences in these markets. We need a dedicated team to think through those issues.”It’s clear why a company might want to whip up a product team from scratch, but what about the how?When a product manager is engaged with a given team, how do you sell her on dropping everything to tackle a new challenge? If you’ve established a vision-based company culture, this is where you’ll really reap the rewards. Teams will be bought in to accomplishing a goal, not bringing a particular feature or product to market. “If you’ve done it right from the get-go—articulated your vision, outcome and goals right — it should be much easier to have a conversation about reallocating human resources,” says Golden.Decommissioning a team is often the harder side of this equation, but there too, let your product vision serve as a touchstone. Take the team through your goal-setting framework and identify where things went wrong or changed. Was it a flaw in the product vision, strategy, goal, metrics, or resourcing? “If you go through that process, then the team gets much more comfortable with the reason things didn’t work out as well as they thought,” says Golden. Moreover, in an iterative product management culture, individuals have less to fear.You can’t achieve a real culture of iteration without accepting failure. “The key to postmortems is obviously to not point fingers. It’s all about lessons learned and identifying why things happened the way they did.”From 2012 to 2013, Golden managed a team that focused on user tools. They handled all guest and host interactions after the booking and tackled many issues around reservation alterations, refunds, and cancellations. But they didn’t have a clear mission that related to an outcome.“We realized that it would be best to disperse the team into two outcome oriented teams — the booking flow team and the host team,” he says. “This enabled these two teams to realize their mandate through a wider but yet overall more simplistic scope.”IMPORTANT REMINDER: You must repeat yourself to make any of this workSure, Airbnb has reached a scale that few startups do — but Golden is not as far removed from the early-stage days as you might think. “As Airbnb’s product organization expands, each team is actually starting to look like Airbnb did a couple of years ago. Those teams are getting to a size where they’re almost early-stage startup companies on their own,” he says. And like any good startup leader, Golden knows that the key to keeping his teams humming is constant communication.To that end, he hews closely to three simple pillars: process, context, and listening. Process: Having a clear framework for making company decisions, as we’ve seen, is key. Transparently discussing the results of that process is, too. Context: A clear vision isn’t enough, though. You need to make sure everyone on the team sees that vision too. Don’t be afraid to repeat yourself. In fact, be sure to repeat yourself. “You have to communicate it all the time,” says Golden. “And as new people join the team, tell them the history of how things evolved. That context is usually really helpful.” Listening: As a team leader, Golden is also acutely aware that his communication responsibilities go both ways; just as he repeatedly shares the company’s vision with his team, he also contributes his teams’ feedback to leadership’s ongoing vision making. “You’re not going to be able to make the best decisions without actually talking to individual people and making sure that you’re addressing their concerns.”“It’s the job of a team lead — whether in product, engineering, design, or data — to communicate the what and the why. But if people don’t agree, then you have to revisit them. Anybody can push back. Challenging core fundamental assumptions is really healthy.”Beyond these three tenets of communication, Golden is not one to dictate how often teams should meet with each other, or how they manage their internal messaging. “We allow each team to figure out their own cadence, their own process and structure. We like to see each team have it’s own character—a little bit of identity.”When you do the work of establishing a mission-driven culture, you can afford to be flexible on the details.“Again, much of the work of product management is making sure everybody understands the what and the why," he says. "Leaving it up to teams to figure out how to actually make that happen empowers them to do better and find more meaning in their work. I think everyone wants a say in their daily work — that’s not just in tech land, that’s in life.”Recommended ArticlesFirst Round TalentAccess exclusive opportunities at the startups

Drawing on Scripture and the phenomenal success of Land of Thousand Hills Coffee, entrepreneur Jonathan David Golden helps readers discover their own passion and dares them to have the courage to pursue it.




Description


Almost anyone you ask would say that they want to do work that matters. Yet just one third of Christians feel "called" to the work they currently do. Others may feel a sense of calling but lack either the courage or the supportive community to carry it out. Jonathan D. Golden, founder of Land of a Thousand Hills coffee company, has discovered and is living out his unique calling to promote social, spiritual, and economic justice while providing a living wage to 2,500 farmers in Rwanda and Haiti. In his book Be Good. Do Good., he reveals to readers how to identify their calling, dispels the myths and misunderstandings we often have about what constitutes a calling, and challenges them to pursue that calling with a courage that can surmount the many obstacles that may lie in their path. He also shows readers how to cultivate a community of support that will help them fulfill their calling.

God spends the day elsewhere, but He sleeps in Rwanda.


This may be a popular saying in that East African country, but my view of Rwanda has been shaped by 1990s era news reports of violence, genocide, and war.  Jonathan David Golden has spent a few nights in Rwanda himself, and the result of that is a multi-million dollar coffee business that promotes justice through partnering directly with Rwandan farmers to make excellent coffee  and to make a difference.


Be You.  Do Good. tells the story of Jonathans journey from conflicted and confused to confident and called.  On his way to The Land of a Thousand Hills (the name of his company and another nickname for Rwanda), he extracts twelve principles that shaped his missional world view:


1. Let Go of the Myths  We believe all kinds of false statements about calling and vocation that keep us mired in indecision.


2.Be Who You Are  Life is a cosmic collaboration in which God works through the person he created to do a great thing.  Dont put that self on the shelf.


3.Use What You Have  Take the first step, and dont wait. Notice who is nearby to help, and live scrappy!


4.Get What You Can  Sounds pretty radical, right? Jonathan is a believer in The Big Ask.  Tempered by the truth that its not about you, but about the call, this is a legitimate position:  you are inviting others into Gods work.


5.Follow the Inkling  God invites us into adventure.  Our experiences and gifts are custom-made to equip us for that faithful following.


6.Pursue What Makes You Come Alive  Sensitive to social injustice from the time he was a boy, Jonathan realized that his entrepreneurial spirit and his heart for ministry could make a difference in Rwanda through the production of coffee.  This chemistry of passion and ability is what we all need to find.


7.Find a People to Serve  A healthy community is one in which everyone blesses and everyone is blessed in return.  For Jonathan, it was a matter of not being The Rich White Guy.  Serve and be served.


8.Growing Little by Little  The work of forgiveness, finding your calling, reaching your goals:  these are all works of slow grace.


9.March Through Challenges  One foot ahead of the other requires a mundane soldiering through the hard times.  Jonathan shares his liturgy for life which, essentially, is a daily turning of his face toward what is true.


10.Follow, Dont Force  Forging through with ones own agenda can be dangerous.  Pause and allow the Holy Spirit to show the next step.


11.Stand Back Up  When the wheels come off our plans, the choice between give-up and stand-up is a tough one.  The myth of easy can keep us from persevering.


12.Stay Open to New Possibilities  Open eyes to the needs around us and open hearts to hear the voice of the Spirit are essential to readiness.


Intensely practical and yet highly motivational, Be You. Do Good. is a call to gritty obedience and a faithful following that honors Gods unique gifting of the believer.  When the Spirit whispers, take one brave step.  Then, see what God does with your availability.

            Today we are brought a new book, courtesy of Jonathan David Golden.    It was an interesting read and was filled with helpful tips for those who do not feel like they are living a life that makes them feel "alive."   Jonathan's story was encouraging to read, as it detailed a regular guy and his journey to listening to the Lord.  For people like myself, going out on a limb and following the Lord's crazy callings is not easy, and this book encouraged me to be more bold. I enjoyed tracking the humble beginnings of Jonathan's coffee company and seeing it grow over time into a company that is growing into a profitable business.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take the next step in their life or feels stuck in a rut.  I am not really into self-help  books as a rule but this was easy for me to read.  His personal life stories made it much more interesting to me and didn't feel like it was an impersonal list of things I need to do to get "better." I would give this book 4/5 stars.


This book was provided to me by Baker Books in exchange for my honest opinion.

Goes beyond "What" to "WHO." Call to courage and purpose.

            I love when a book asks good questions. This one goes beyond What do you want to be when you grow up? to Who do you want to be? Jonathan Golden has an impressive resume, but shares how his accomplishments dont mean anything without purpose behind them. I deeply resonated with his drive to do more than just what was expected or what looked good. He speaks throughout his book of the quiet faithfulness behind real transformation, doing things little by little. I love the courage he speaks of to start doing the things that make you come alive. Every calling begins with one brave step. (48) He gives permission for the unconventional and bold, inviting the reader to ask better questions of what it means to live a life of meaning. 4/5 for me.

            Earlier this year, I asked to review an Amish fiction book. By mistake, I received Jonathan David Golden's book Be You. Do Good. I was told I could read it or pass it on, since it had been sent in error. I decided maybe the mistake wasn't so much of a mistake, and I should read the book.


The subtitle is "Having the guts to pursue what makes you come alive," and since I'm still in my first year of career change and new paths, I thought perhaps this would offer me something really pivotal to help me in my journey.


I was so sad when I finally closed the book, because it wasn't my favorite. I pondered just skipping the review entirely because I didn't want to say something negative, but I decided to go ahead with it, believing that part of being a book reviewer is knowing every book might not zing me and being okay with admitting when one does not.


Jonathan is the founder of a successful business called Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee Company. {COFFEE!!! I mean how could this go wrong for me??} The book shares many of the stories of his life, but particularly over the last decade as he founded this company and went through seasons of success and failure, personally and professionally.


I did a lot of underlining in the first chapter and felt excited that I would learn so much from this book, but the chapters that followed were predominantly story, with a tag line of application at the end of each one. It seemed the main meat of the book was all in the first chapter. I craved less story and more explanation of how he imagined others could apply what he experienced in their own lives. I think I felt so disconnected from it because I know that my own calling is not to run a multi-million-dollar corporation, nor is it to work across national boundaries, so I wanted to know how to apply the principles in ordinary-world. {I'm not opposed to doing the heavy lifting as a reader and figuring out how to make something fit my own details. In this situation, I just didn't feel like I'd been given enough actual teaching to do so.}


It was much more of a business book than a Christian living book, in my opinion, though it is marketed as Christian living. The copy on the back of the book indicates that anyone looking to make a career out of their life calling can learn from the book, but I did not find it to be a good fit for me.


Make no mistake: his stories are interesting, and there is much to learn about the country of Rwanda and the coffee business through reading the pages, but I just ached for a little bit more guidance and a little bit less story.


If you're a business-minded person and you aspire to head a corporation someday, this actually might be a great book for you. It just wasn't for me, and I was sorry for that.


* I received this book from Baker in exchange for an honest review. *

            Many of us struggle with or know the struggle of trying to find our way through this one life. It sometimes does not come to most of us so easily nor does it develop overtime. However, Be You. Do Good by Jonathan David Golden gives, shares, and demonstrates the ways in which any one of us can find the right path. This book is the perfect tool that will enable us to work out the kinks or balance out the thoughts that linger in whether we should take the next step in pushing our boundaries. I found this book to be inspiring and a fast read to enjoy and pushes its reader to take the leap in the direction that will make a happy life. It may seem like it can be an easy pursuit to finding what calls you to do in life, but Golden shares the words that will guide us to a meaningful life. A must read. I received a copy for this review from Baker Books and all opinions are my own.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Almost anyone you ask would say that they want to do work that matters. Yet many people do not feel like they are actively making a difference in the world. Others may feel a sense of calling but lack either the courage or the supportive community to carry it out. But if God created each of us on purpose, for a purpose, we should be ordering our lives around that purpose.Jonathan D. Golden, founder of Land of a Thousand Hills coffee company, has discovered and is living out his unique calling to promote social, spiritual, and economic justice while providing a living wage to 2,500 farmers in Rwanda. Now he reveals to readers how to identify their calling, dispels the myths and misunderstandings we often have about what constitutes a calling, and challenges them to pursue that calling with a courage that can surmount the many obstacles that may lie in their path. He also shows readers how to cultivate a community of support that will help them fulfill their calling.For anyone who is dissatisfied with the work they are doing, just entering the workforce, or wondering what more is out there, this book reveals how to embrace the meaningful life they were meant to live.

God spends the day elsewhere, but He sleeps in Rwanda.


This may be a popular saying in that East African country, but my view of Rwanda has been shaped by 1990s era news reports of violence, genocide, and war.  Jonathan David Golden has spent a few nights in Rwanda himself, and the result of that is a multi-million dollar coffee business that promotes justice through partnering directly with Rwandan farmers to make excellent coffee  and to make a difference.


Be You.  Do Good. tells the story of Jonathans journey from conflicted and confused to confident and called.  On his way to The Land of a Thousand Hills (the name of his company and another nickname for Rwanda), he extracts twelve principles that shaped his missional world view:


1. Let Go of the Myths  We believe all kinds of false statements about calling and vocation that keep us mired in indecision.


2.Be Who You Are  Life is a cosmic collaboration in which God works through the person he created to do a great thing.  Dont put that self on the shelf.


3.Use What You Have  Take the first step, and dont wait. Notice who is nearby to help, and live scrappy!


4.Get What You Can  Sounds pretty radical, right? Jonathan is a believer in The Big Ask.  Tempered by the truth that its not about you, but about the call, this is a legitimate position:  you are inviting others into Gods work.


5.Follow the Inkling  God invites us into adventure.  Our experiences and gifts are custom-made to equip us for that faithful following.


6.Pursue What Makes You Come Alive  Sensitive to social injustice from the time he was a boy, Jonathan realized that his entrepreneurial spirit and his heart for ministry could make a difference in Rwanda through the production of coffee.  This chemistry of passion and ability is what we all need to find.


7.Find a People to Serve  A healthy community is one in which everyone blesses and everyone is blessed in return.  For Jonathan, it was a matter of not being The Rich White Guy.  Serve and be served.


8.Growing Little by Little  The work of forgiveness, finding your calling, reaching your goals:  these are all works of slow grace.


9.March Through Challenges  One foot ahead of the other requires a mundane soldiering through the hard times.  Jonathan shares his liturgy for life which, essentially, is a daily turning of his face toward what is true.


10.Follow, Dont Force  Forging through with ones own agenda can be dangerous.  Pause and allow the Holy Spirit to show the next step.


11.Stand Back Up  When the wheels come off our plans, the choice between give-up and stand-up is a tough one.  The myth of easy can keep us from persevering.


12.Stay Open to New Possibilities  Open eyes to the needs around us and open hearts to hear the voice of the Spirit are essential to readiness.


Intensely practical and yet highly motivational, Be You. Do Good. is a call to gritty obedience and a faithful following that honors Gods unique gifting of the believer.  When the Spirit whispers, take one brave step.  Then, see what God does with your availability.

            Today we are brought a new book, courtesy of Jonathan David Golden.    It was an interesting read and was filled with helpful tips for those who do not feel like they are living a life that makes them feel "alive."   Jonathan's story was encouraging to read, as it detailed a regular guy and his journey to listening to the Lord.  For people like myself, going out on a limb and following the Lord's crazy callings is not easy, and this book encouraged me to be more bold. I enjoyed tracking the humble beginnings of Jonathan's coffee company and seeing it grow over time into a company that is growing into a profitable business.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take the next step in their life or feels stuck in a rut.  I am not really into self-help  books as a rule but this was easy for me to read.  His personal life stories made it much more interesting to me and didn't feel like it was an impersonal list of things I need to do to get "better." I would give this book 4/5 stars.

            I love when a book asks good questions. This one goes beyond What do you want to be when you grow up? to Who do you want to be? Jonathan Golden has an impressive resume, but shares how his accomplishments dont mean anything without purpose behind them. I deeply resonated with his drive to do more than just what was expected or what looked good. He speaks throughout his book of the quiet faithfulness behind real transformation, doing things little by little. I love the courage he speaks of to start doing the things that make you come alive. Every calling begins with one brave step. (48) He gives permission for the unconventional and bold, inviting the reader to ask better questions of what it means to live a life of meaning. 4/5 for me.

            Earlier this year, I asked to review an Amish fiction book. By mistake, I received Jonathan David Golden's book Be You. Do Good. I was told I could read it or pass it on, since it had been sent in error. I decided maybe the mistake wasn't so much of a mistake, and I should read the book.


The subtitle is "Having the guts to pursue what makes you come alive," and since I'm still in my first year of career change and new paths, I thought perhaps this would offer me something really pivotal to help me in my journey.


I was so sad when I finally closed the book, because it wasn't my favorite. I pondered just skipping the review entirely because I didn't want to say something negative, but I decided to go ahead with it, believing that part of being a book reviewer is knowing every book might not zing me and being okay with admitting when one does not.


Jonathan is the founder of a successful business called Land of a Thousand Hills Coffee Company. {COFFEE!!! I mean how could this go wrong for me??} The book shares many of the stories of his life, but particularly over the last decade as he founded this company and went through seasons of success and failure, personally and professionally.


I did a lot of underlining in the first chapter and felt excited that I would learn so much from this book, but the chapters that followed were predominantly story, with a tag line of application at the end of each one. It seemed the main meat of the book was all in the first chapter. I craved less story and more explanation of how he imagined others could apply what he experienced in their own lives. I think I felt so disconnected from it because I know that my own calling is not to run a multi-million-dollar corporation, nor is it to work across national boundaries, so I wanted to know how to apply the principles in ordinary-world. {I'm not opposed to doing the heavy lifting as a reader and figuring out how to make something fit my own details. In this situation, I just didn't feel like I'd been given enough actual teaching to do so.}


It was much more of a business book than a Christian living book, in my opinion, though it is marketed as Christian living. The copy on the back of the book indicates that anyone looking to make a career out of their life calling can learn from the book, but I did not find it to be a good fit for me.


Make no mistake: his stories are interesting, and there is much to learn about the country of Rwanda and the coffee business through reading the pages, but I just ached for a little bit more guidance and a little bit less story.


If you're a business-minded person and you aspire to head a corporation someday, this actually might be a great book for you. It just wasn't for me, and I was sorry for that.


* I received this book from Baker in exchange for an honest review. *

            Many of us struggle with or know the struggle of trying to find our way through this one life. It sometimes does not come to most of us so easily nor does it develop overtime. However, Be You. Do Good by Jonathan David Golden gives, shares, and demonstrates the ways in which any one of us can find the right path. This book is the perfect tool that will enable us to work out the kinks or balance out the thoughts that linger in whether we should take the next step in pushing our boundaries. I found this book to be inspiring and a fast read to enjoy and pushes its reader to take the leap in the direction that will make a happy life. It may seem like it can be an easy pursuit to finding what calls you to do in life, but Golden shares the words that will guide us to a meaningful life. A must read. I received a copy for this review from Baker Books and all opinions are my own.

                    Featured Experience
                    



Successfully sold the operating company of a large Atlanta-based grocery store chain to a private equity firm, while simultaneously spinning off the real estate in a publicly traded distribution to the owners of the operating company. In an innovative procedure, the public limited partnership then leased the property back to the real estate firm for use in operations.
Represented Moovies Inc. in the merger of nearly 10 video rental companies throughout the Southeast. In an innovative and complex procedure, the owners all signed a contract to merge and go public simultaneously, and the proceeds from the public offering were used to close on the deal, pay off any debt, and provide the owners with cash, as well as shares in the merged company, resulting in $100 million deal. Ultimately, the new company multiplied to approximately 400 stores nationwide by acquiring smaller chains after the merger.
Led the public offering of Sysco Corporation, Fortune 100 national food distribution company, from its beginning to the present, including more than 100 acquisitions, dozens of public company offerings and listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
