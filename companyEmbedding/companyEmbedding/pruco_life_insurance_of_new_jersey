What is Term Life Insurance?

Term life insurance is the most affordable way to protect your family's financial security if something happens to you.
Men and women in excellent health in their mid 30s and 40s can buy $100,000+ of term life insurance for under a dollar a day.
You can buy term life insurance for 10, 15, 20, or 30 years — however long you need it.
In most cases, term life insurance proceeds are tax-free. Consult with your tax advisor if you have any questions.  



How Much Do I Need?

Term life insurance is the most affordable – and flexible – Life insurance product available. Why? Because term life insurance provides a specific death benefit amount for a duration – or term – chosen by the policyholder. Once a 10-, 15-, 20-, or 30-year term is selected, the coverage and premium amounts remain the same for the life of the policy. So rather than paying a monthly premium for the rest of your life, you can simply buy coverage for however long you need it – usually until your children are grown and out of the house.
Life insurance is a personal affair. Standard formulas such as buying coverage equal to eight, nine or ten times your annual income are inadequate shortcuts. Online calculators can provide a general guide, but it doesn't make sense to say that someone with four young children should have the same amount of coverage as empty nesters with no mortgage and a substantial retirement fund. Other items to consider:
The time factor. Figure out how many years you'll need to be covered.
Final expenses. Determine the total cost of your funeral, burial and related expenses.
Mortgages and other debts. Tally your mortgage balance, car loans, student loans, and any other major expenses.
Education expenses. This calculation can be tricky because you need to consider the cost of a college education at the time your kids will enroll, as opposed to what it would cost today. Hint: It will be more expensive.
Income replacement. Once you cover funeral expenses, debts and education, you need to determine the amount of income required for your family members to sustain their current lifestyle. 
A conversation with an experienced agent can provide the guidance you need.

FAQs for Retirement






             Why do I have a Customer Identification Number?
          






To protect your privacy, Prudential does not use your Social Security Number (SSN) in any correspondence we send you. Instead, we create a unique Customer Identification Number (CIN) for every person with an annuity as an identifier to be used in place of your SSN in our communications to you. The CIN is a nine-digit, alpha-numeric number that starts with a letter—for example, A12345678.








             What is the "Contract" that was purchased and what kind of annuity was purchased for me under it—a group annuity or an individual annuity?
          






The “Contract” that was purchased to provide your annuity is a group annuity contract offered through the Prudential Insurance Company of America. A group annuity contract is a financial product sold by an insurance company that provides a guaranteed stream of income for members of a group at stated intervals (in this case monthly) for each recipient’s lifetime, and, in some circumstances, if applicable, for the lifetime of a joint annuitant (such as a spouse) thereafter.








             What is a Contract Number and why do I need to reference it when I contact you?
          






A Contract Number is the unique identifying number assigned to the group annuity contract that covers the annuity that was purchased for you. Whenever you contact us by phone or mail, you should reference your Contract Number. It helps us locate your records on our administrative systems and enables us to be more responsive to you.








             On My Fact Sheet there’s a box – Important Information Regarding Beneficiary Designation. Why do I need to complete your Beneficiary Designation Form?
          






If this box appears on your Fact Sheet, then your benefit has a death benefit feature that requires you to designate a beneficiary:

Prudential is required to have your valid beneficiary designation form in our records. Since your prior payer did not transfer your prior beneficiary designation form to us, we ask that you complete the form enclosed in this folder and return it to Prudential to ensure that we have your valid beneficiary form on file.
If this box is not on your Fact Sheet, your benefit does not have a death benefit feature.









             I currently receive my pension benefit through direct deposit. Will Prudential continue that?
          






If you currently receive your pension through direct deposit, your prior payer provided that information to Prudential, and we will continue direct deposit of your benefit. No action or information is required on your part for Prudential to continue your direct deposit.








             How safe is my Prudential annuity?
          






Your annuity is provided under a group annuity contract issued by The Prudential Insurance Company of America, a New Jersey life insurance company whose principal office is located in Newark, New Jersey. As a highly regulated insurance company, The Prudential Insurance Company of America is required to maintain appropriate reserves to meet its financial obligations.

2017


Lesser of $5,500 or 100% of Taxable Income


Lesser of $6,500 or 100% of Taxable Income












             What is the contribution deadline for Tax Year 2016?
          






Traditional IRA and Roth IRA contributions received between January 1 and the tax filing deadline may be attributed to tax year 2016. Written instructions indicating attribution to the previous tax year must accompany the contribution, or else the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year. The federal tax filing deadline for Tax Year 2016 is April 18, 2017.

IRA checks that are received after April 18, 2017, but on or before April 22, 2017 must be accompanied with proof that the check was post-marked to the Agent/Financial Professional on or before April 18, 2017. Proof should be a copy or fax of the envelope with the post-mark, or statement of proof of delivery by the USPS or courier service (i.e. UPS or Federal Express); not the actual envelope. Otherwise the contribution will be attributed to the current tax year.

All Tax Year Contributions received after April 22, 2017 will be coded with the 2017 Tax Year.

New contracts must be issued on or before April 18, 2017 for a contribution to be attributed to the 2016 tax year, even if a contribution is made with accompanying attribution instructions prior to the tax filing deadline.

All SEP IRA contributions are coded for the current calendar year, no exceptions.








             If my contract is owned by a trust and is not subject to 72(u), why was the Form 1099-R coded with a 1 in box 7 when I'm over 59?
          






Entity owned contracts, i.e. Trusts, are not subject to 72(u) will always use Distribution code 1, as there is no date of birth for an entity, except in the case of a Grantor Trust. Distributions from a Grantor Trust are reported based on the Grantor's date of birth (DOB), and it will be coded as a 1 for an early distribution or as a 7 for normal distribution based on the Grantor's DOB.








             Why wasn't my Form 1099-R coded as a disability payment?
          






The withdrawal form did not indicate disability. You can file IRS Form 5329 and would have to prove to the IRS on your own that the disability exception applies.








             Why is my entire distribution taxable?
          






For Non-Qualified contracts there are 2 possible reasons:

The distribution was all earnings; it did not contain any return of cost basis.
The contract is aggregated.

For Qualified contracts (except for Qualified Trustee Owned Pension Plans and 457 Plans):

Since some or all of the distribution may be taxable as ordinary income for the tax year in which the distribution is made. We report all distributions as fully taxable on IRS Form 1099-R. If a portion of the distribution is not taxable, you would indicate that on your own return.

Qualified contracts are funded with pretax dollars and Prudential doesn't track Cost Basis. Non-Qualified are funded with after tax dollars, and earnings are taxable and generally come out first.








             Why is box 2b "Taxable amount not determined" checked on my 1099-R?
          







Taxable Amount Not determined is used on Non-Qualified accounts that were funded with a 1035 exchange where the prior institution did not send us the cost basis
For Roth IRA contracts we report all distributions as taxable amount not determined









             Why does my Form 1099-R show such a high taxable amount compared to my cost basis?
          






If the taxable amount seems high this contract is most likely a non-qualified annuity that is part of an aggregated group.
Section 72(e) (12) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that all annuities entered into after October 21, 1988 be aggregated and treated as a single deferred annuity contract for the purpose of determining the amount of taxable gain includible in gross income. Aggregation applies to all contracts:

Purchased by the same contract owner
From the same insurance company and its affiliates
During the same calendar year

All non-qualified annuity contracts issued to the same contract owner, by the same insurance company or affiliate, in the same calendar year they are treated as a single contract for tax gain purposes. Aggregated groups are determined by the TIN of the owner.
Aggregation rules do not apply to: Qualified Contracts, Immediate Annuities, contracts subject to 72(u) of the Internal Revenue Code and contracts issued prior to October 21, 1988.








             Why did I receive tax Form 1099-R if I converted my IRA into a Roth IRA?
          






An IRA to Roth conversion is generally fully taxable. Taxable amounts are included in income in the year of conversion subject to ordinary income tax. 10% withholding applies unless election out. RMD if applicable should be removed before the conversion.
Amounts converted from an eligible IRA to a Roth IRA are required to be included in the customer's taxable income in the year of conversion. Generally, this includes deductible contributions made to the IRA and any earnings on those contributions and the present value of the actuarial benefit if applicable. A Form 1099-R will be issued reflecting the conversion from the traditional to the Roth IRA. The Form 1099-R will reflect a distribution code of either a 2 (under 59 ½ with an exception) or 7 (over 59 ½). In addition, a Form 5498 will be generated to reflect the amounts converted to the Roth IRA.








             Why did I receive tax Form 1099-R when I received these funds as a Death Claim?
          






Death proceeds from an annuity contract are taxable to the extent that there is gain. Under normal circumstances a beneficiary is responsible for the income tax on the death benefit they receive. However, there are exceptions to this general rule as indicated below.

On an annuitant driven contract the death proceeds are payable at the death of the annuitant and are payable to the beneficiary. If the annuitant is the owner, tax reporting is to the beneficiary. If the annuitant and owner are different, tax reporting is to the owner.

On an owner driven contract the proceeds become payable upon death of the owner. For single owned contracts, the proceeds are paid to and reportable to the beneficiary. For Jointly owned contracts, if the surviving owner is not the beneficiary, the surviving owner will receive the tax reporting, however, the beneficiary will receive the proceeds.

Pruco Life Insurance Company Key Developments

Pruco Life Insurance Company Introduces PruLife Survivorship Index Universal Life
Jan 5 16
Pruco Life Insurance Company has introduced, PruLife Survivorship Index Universal Life, a new product that provides death benefit protection for two lives and the opportunity to build cash value through multiple interest crediting options. Within the policy, customers can choose how the cash value can grow – through an indexed account that credits interest based upon the performance of the S&P 500, a fixed account, which credits interest based on a fixed rate, or a combination of both. The indexed account is subject to a cap and a floor on the amount of interest earned, but the crediting rate will never be less than zero percent. The fixed account offers a set rate declared by Prudential, which is guaranteed to never be less than 2%. Clients also have the option of combining the types of interest that is credited to their policy – both index and fixed interest. This can help create a balance between the upside potential of the indexed account and the stability of the fixed account. PruLife Survivorship Index UL is issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company in all states except in New York where, if available, it is issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey. Both are Prudential Financial companies located in Newark, NJ and are solely responsible for their own financial condition and contractual obligations. The contract number is SIUNLG-2015 or ICC15 SIUNLG-2015 and the product may not be available in all states. Policies contain exclusions, limitations, reductions in benefits and terms for keeping them in force. A financial professional can provide with costs and complete details. The PruLife Survivorship Index UL policy is not a variable contract or an investment. Money that is placed in the Indexed Account is not a direct investment in the S&P 500 Index. If amounts in the Indexed Account are withdrawn prior to the end of the one-year term, no interest will be credited.
