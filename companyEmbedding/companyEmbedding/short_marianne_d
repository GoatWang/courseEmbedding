We have a Marianne! She's now 4 and just gorgeous (gush gush). No obvious abbreviations but she gets called: Manny, Madge (!), Madou, Maddie, Mads... I also really like Annie - may try to push that one as she gets older.FWIW, I still absolutely love the name and I'm so glad that we chose it. Glad others like it too.

I love this name especially as I am very keen on the name Anna also. I'm thinking I could use it and shorten it to 'Anna'.  I always shorten my children's names but I use their full names a lot too. I have a Jessica and she gets Jess, Jessie and Jessica. I also have a Lily (short name anyway) and can't help shortening it to Lils!

I have an 11yo Marianne. We always thought we'd shorten it to Annie but it never stuck. Occasionally her friends shorten it to Maz which I do not like AT ALL!When she was born her 2yo sister could only say Mavianne which became Mav so if we ever shorten it we use Mav/Mavvy. Strangely Mav's ok but Maz aint!Most of the time tho she's Marianne.It's a beautiful name and often commented upon. Don't know where it is (or isn't) in the hot 100.

I have a 2.5yo Marianne (who, incidentally, is also gorgeous  ) and she generally gets her full name, apart from my teenage sister who calls her Mazza, mainly to annoy me.
