POET Technologies Provides Highlights from Annual General Meeting
July 17th, 2017
Technology and Business Updates Focused on  Proprietary Dielectric Hybrid Platformto Accelerate Revenue Growth
SAN JOSE, CA, July 17, 2017 – POET Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “POET”) (OTCQX: POETF; TSX Venture:  PTK), a developer of opto-electronic fabrication processes for the  semiconductor industry provided shareholders with a review of its strategy,  technology roadmap and product development activities during its Annual General  Meeting of shareholders (“AGM”) held in San Jose, California on Thursday, July  13, 2017. 
POET’s Executive Chairman,  David Lazovsky, conducted the formal business of the AGM, including the  approval of all proposals outlined in the Company’s proxy material. POET’s CEO,  Suresh Venkatesan, then presented a strategy, technology and product update.  In addition, Thomas Mika, CFO, updated shareholders  on the Company’s communications policy and expiring Shareholder Rights  Plan.  All three senior managers of POET  participated in an extensive Q&A session.   The slides presented at the meeting along with a webcast replay can be accessed  in the Investor Relations section of POET’s website at: http://www.poet-technologies.com/agm/agm2017.html
Strategy and Technology Overview

POET’s strategy is based on photonics integration (utilizing  both monolithic and hybrid approaches) to lower cost and increase performance of  disruptive solutions for the data communications and sensing markets, while focusing  on the highest Return on Investment (ROI) opportunities available to the  Company;


Recent explosive growth in the market for Indium Phosphide (InP)-based  solutions for data communications at 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) utilizing  Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) provides an opportunity for POET to  leverage its InP facility and production capability in Singapore, its unique and  proprietary dielectric technology, and its wafer-level packaging expertise into  a newly announced Hybrid Dielectric Photonics platform strategy;
POET has demonstrated the functionality of its proprietary dielectric  waveguides for multiplexing and de-multiplexing light signals, allowing for the  development of an optical engine suitable for transceivers operating at 100  gigabits per second (Gbps); engineering samples of these devices are planned to  be delivered to customers this quarter;
POET is strategically allocating resources to capitalize on  the rapidly growing InP Photonics market, which is estimated to grow to an $11  billion addressable market by 2021, in order to increase ROI, accelerate time  to revenue and deliver shareholder value;
Technical challenges related to the manufacturability of the  monolithic GaAs platform, have delayed POET’s development of a Gallium Arsenide  (GaAs)-based optical engine. The additional development time and cost associated  with the GaAs platform will require the Company to secure a strategic partner in  order to develop and commercialize this platform;
POET announced that its Narrow Linewidth Laser products have  demonstrated industry-leading performance with “super-wide” tunability for high  resolution sensing applications, such as gas & chemical sensing, coherent  communication, meteorological sensing and atmospheric LIDAR; additional  developments, including the incorporation of dielectric waveguides and  wafer-level packaging is expected to accelerate growth in the sensing product  line in 2018 and beyond.                

AGM Highlights 
                At the AGM, POET  Technologies shareholders approved the following items:

The current directors were re-elected as proposed, with each  director receiving over 88% of the votes cast;
Marcum LLP, Certified Public Accountants, of New Haven,  Connecticut were reappointed as auditors of the Company for the ensuing year.

Director Compensation
                In an effort to reduce cash  expenses, and following a review of peer group companies, the POET Board of Directors  recently revised its compensation. This included reducing the cash compensation  paid to its Executive Chairman, and effective April 1, 2017, eliminating  per-meeting fees and reducing the annual cash retainer paid to directors. In  the recent past, the demands on the Board to address key strategic and  operating challenges resulted in frequent and numerous meetings, with  per-meeting fees representing a substantial portion of total director  compensation. In the newly-adopted program, the Executive Chairman is paid US$200,000  annually. The annual cash retainer for each director is reduced to US$30,000  and each committee chairperson receives an additional annual retainer of US$10,000.  The balance of director compensation is paid in stock options at a value of US$90,000  annually, plus US$10,000 per year in value of options to each committee  chairperson. The valuation of options grants is based on the Black-Scholes  option pricing model. The awarded stock options for directors vest quarterly in  arrears over one year to match the period of service provided by each director.   
Options Grant
                  At the meeting of the Board  of Directors following the AGM, as part of the Company’s incentive stock option  grant program, options were granted to certain directors, officers and  employees of the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 9,225,000 common  shares, representing approximately 3.55% of the outstanding shares of the  Company.
Employees as a group:  2,225,000
Management as a group:  4,000,000
Directors as a group:  3,000,000                                                                                                             
                  The options are  exercisable for 10 years at a price of CAD$0.28 (US$0.22) being the closing  price of the Company’s shares on July 12, 2017.   The directors’ options vest quarterly in arrears over the one year of  service as a director until the next Annual General Meeting. All other options  granted to employees and management vest 25% on the first anniversary of the  grant and the balance vests quarterly over a further three-year period  thereafter.  The grant to the directors  represents the option portion of directors’ fees for the 15-month period from April  1, 2017, when the cash fees were reduced, through the next AGM to be scheduled  in approximately one year from the present.
The options were  granted subject to provisions of the Company’s stock option plan and are  subject to the TSX Venture Exchange policies and applicable securities laws.  For further details on the Company’s share capital, refer to the Company’s  Financial Statements and MD&A for the 3-months ended March 31, 2017 which  were filed on SEDAR on May 11, 2017.

See more information below!  What Does “POET” Mean? What Does “PET” Mean? • “POET” = “Planar Opto-Electronic Technology”. • POET is a revolutionary Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) process used to build electrical, optical, and electro-optical integrated circuits. • Supports a full range of electrical and optical active and passive circuit components. • Very high performance versus existing silicon (up to 100x faster). • Very low power consumption versus existing silicon (up to 95% less). • Much more versatile than legacy compound semiconductor processes (GaAs, InP, others). • Can be manufactured using existing CMOS chipmaking equipment. • Fully compatible with existing semiconductor design and manufacturing flows. • Will allow unprecedented integration into a single chip of functions that take entire chipsets today for large component cost reduction, and (particularly for optics) tremendous (e.g. 80%) reduction in assembly and test costs.  • "PET“ = Planar Electronic Technology”. • PET is the electrical subset of the full POET process. • Can support CMOS, Bi-CMOS, and Bipolar device fabrication. • Offers lower cost, simpler process/fab options for applications that don’t require optical feature set.  POET’s benefits are analogous to the benefits of the first silicon integrated circuits: • Eliminate connectors, solder joints, assembly and multiple packaging steps. • Decrease size, cost, complexity and power. • Increase performance and reliability. • Create a path for future improvements and scaling. • Board-to-board, chip-to-chip optics with low-cost integrated transceivers. • Substantial increase in chip I/O bandwidth with reduced power using integrated wavelengthdivision multiplexing. • A higher speed and lower power complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with integrated serializer/deserializer & clock data recovery (SERDES & CDR). • Novel high-density universal memory, Optical RF generation, RF photonic filtering, Optoelectronic low-jitter clock generation and on-chip optical distribution, OE computing and new architectures based on O&E combinations (e.g. quantum computing).  3rd Party Independent Validation of POET: • POET Technologies partners with an international defense services company that is a global leader in military electronic systems design, development, manufacturing and integration. • Funded by AFRL, POET entered into a contract with 3rd party partner in 2008 with the intent of replicating a specific POET device in a 3rd party MIL Spec. environment. • The 3rd party partner has world-class GaAs research facilities and has numerous PhD researchers working on the continued development of POET. • POET’s partnership has successfully reproduced the POET technology as published, by producing and testing the critical electrical elements of POET Platform sub-process steps for transistors. (see more in the "Third Party Valuation of its POET Technology" pdf.)  Ready At The Right Time: CMOS Silicon Evolution Is Ending! • Moore’s Law era 1960-2015? • CPU/GPU execution unit speeds haven’t improved in over 10 years. • Industry looking for new technology path. • Packaging Techniques Have Not Improved OE Transceiver Cost. • Various hybrid integration techniques like 2.5/3 D packaging, silicon photonics have not led to improved Opto-Electronic Transceiver costs. • Single-chip transceivers needed for fiber to fully replace copper for system interconnect applications. • Copper Cable Era For System Interconnect Is Ending. • 1 Gigabit Ethernet system interconnect was and is mostly copper-based. • 10 Gigabit Ethernet system interconnect was and is almost entirely fiber-based. • Optical Systems Need More Lithography, Less Mechanical Assembly. • Many optical systems that need aligned arrays of sensors and/or lasers cannot be built today due to mechanical assembly cost constraints. • POET offers this alignment capability by means of lithography, dramatically lowering the cost of these products (IR sensors, holographic displays, etc.).  Applications: • POET’s technology can surpass speed limits of widely used CMOS silicon chips and is much better positioned for stacking multiple chips to increase performance. • A functional POET device may reduce the power consumption of laptops, tablets, smartphones, servers, and/or other electronic devices by 80%. • Leads to drastic reduction in device size and battery power consumption. • Power reduction in commercial-scale server farms represents tremendous cost savings to companies like IBM, Google and Intel. • In November 2011, Hewlett Packard announced that it is working with numerous chip manufacturers to create ultraefficient, low-energy servers aimed at companies running largescale remote computing operations such as Twitter and Facebook. • POET can also produce an infra-red sensor for use in air, sea, ground, and space with sensitivity that is an order of magnitude higher than existing technology.  Commercial Applications: • CPU. • Memory. • CMOS. • Servers. • Processor to Processor Optical Interconnect.  Communication Applications: • Smart Phones. • Network (Cell Towers, LANs, MANs). • Fiber to the Home (FTTH).  Defense  Applications: • Infrared Sensors (Uncooled – SWIR, MWIR, LWIR). Integrated photonics and electronics for: • Radar and Lidar. • Communications. • Displays. • Hardened computers and memory. • Microwave and millimetre wave power sources.  Other  Applications: • Active Optical Cables. • Coherent laser arrays for pumps, industrial applications. • Commercial UV/VIS/NIR cameras. • Medical Imaging Devices.  Complementary Technologies: 2.5 D Packaging • Refers to die-stacking where multiple chips are put in a single package; often used for memory devices. 3 D Packaging • Refers to true multiple-chip packaging where devices can be assembled in any orientation to one another in the vertical or horizontal plane. Silicon Photonics • Typically involves a passive silicon substrate providing optical (and often electrical) interconnect between separate active devices attached to it. Coherent Optics. • Module-level tunable integrated optical circuits for DWDM optical networking applications.  Four Examples of POET Value: CMOS Silicon: • Final CMOS Si geometry (10/11 nm) is under development now; first production 2015? • POET/PET offer about 100x speed improvement over CMOS silicon. • POET/PET offer 10-100x power efficiency improvement over CMOS silicon.  OE Conversion: • As example, current 10 Gigabit Ethernet transceivers use about 10 individually packaged ICs on a substrate in a die-cast housing; POET can reduce this to 1 individually packaged IC. • Depending on application, POET can reduce overall OE transceiver cost by 60 to 90%.  Memory and Storage: • Current memory types include dedicated SRAM, DRAM, and NVRAM devices. • POET/PET memory cell can concurrently support all three memory types. • Massive simplification at system level due to elimination of NVRAM backup/recovery. • Much lower bit error rates than silicon-based memories (several orders of magnitude).  Sensors and Weapons: • POET provides low-cost optical thyristor arrays that can be used as dual-mode sensor/laser arrays (same panel can find targets and destroy them). • Main reason US Government funded research for so long (19 years and counting).  For more information read the Corporate Presentation Q3 2013 + Extensive DD collection below: http://www.poet-technologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/POET_Technologies_Corporate-Overview-September-2013.pdf  Short to Mid Term Goals Q4 October - December:  - The business development White Paper will be made available under Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”) to potential prospective partners and IP Licensees only. (this was announced in the Pr of June 3rd, so this could be done already, or in progress [NDA?]) - 2 Milestones to be announced soon, see picture below. (dates are approximations & not etched in stone.) - Milestone #5; "3/4 Terminal Switching Laser Demonstration (POET lab)".    - Milestone #7; "Optical Thyristor-based Infrared Detector Array Fabrication and Validation (3rd Party Fab)". - Milestone 7 could have a contract/license attached with the announcement of this Milestone, or thereafter (days, weeks, a month??). From the Pr June 3rd "Once on-line wafer production begins, (after the repair of the MBE Molecular Beam Epitaxy, which was damaged by Hurricane Sandy), producing wafers for the continuance of the BAE Systems military IR Sensor proof of concept project due for completion later this year will take precedence."  "The POET platform is currently the basis for a number of key projects, including optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) devices for avionics systems, combined RF/optical phased arrays, optoelectronic directional couplers, and ultra-low-power random access memory (RAM)."  - As you can see above there are other key projects that form the basis for a contract/license, which can be announced any day now.  - Just in case there are delay's in the Short Term projections they will then be done in the Mid Term Goals section...  - Contract/License and/or establishing one or more PDA's. Board of Directors have endorsed the next phases of the Company’s commercialization plan put forward by the Special Strategic Committee (SSC) chaired by Executive Director Peter Copetti. The multi-pronged approach is based on discussions with potential industry partners and advisers  regarding the Company’s two key markets consisting of the military and commercial sector that have been identified as potential early adopters of the POET platform. Currently, while POET’s incorporation in  military projects is proceeding well, and should provide value in several key verticals, significant value exists in adapting POET for mass production within a commercial semiconductor fab environment. The Company must rapidly move to the next phase of its commercialization plan, which includes addressing feature size and scalability requirements for commercial fabs. The Board has therefore endorsed, and authorized the SSC to proceed on, these recommendations, including:  * Establishing a POET Development Alliance (PDA) – The Company will be establishing relationships with one or more industrial partners looking towards jointly adapting POET to commercial scale III-V implementation. Alliance partners will provide key input including intellectual assets, technical staff, manufacturing capability, and foundry resources. In addition to optimizing device parameters and yields, a near-term goal will be to establish comprehensive design rules and a device parameter library for POET, which will proliferate licensed designs in a POET device ecosystem.  * Drive for Reduction of Feature Size to 100-nm Range (100NM) – The Company will re-prioritize its technical roadmap by introducing specific milestones associated with reducing feature size from the submicronto the 100-nm range in scale, targeting 4Q2013 for that milestone. Consequently, the milestone for full optoelectronic integration on a single die will be re-scheduled to 2Q2014. Even without this full integration milestone, the 100-nm goal anticipates the cadence of commercial III-V foundry capabilities. This roadmap will focus the Company’s ODIS subsidiary on developmental work that will allow for scalable production within existing commercial fabs.  * Adoption of a Shareholder Rights Plan (SRP) – The Company will be structuring a special SRP to protect the potential value of the company, for all shareholders, during the period where discussions with potential partners may be taking place regarding PDA-related agreements, and as progress on the 100NM project continues.  “This move crystallizes the Company’s strategy for unlocking the value of our intellectual property,” said Mr. Copetti. “A development alliance with the right partners will definitely shorten time-to-market, and help evolve a design ecosystem for POET in the marketplace.”  Further SSC actions will be endorsed by the Board depending on the status of the above initiatives. Mr. Copetti added, “While the new feature-size milestone is a challenge given our commitment to projects in our delivery pipeline, I believe the POET team is more than capable of achieving this goal. There is no doubt that POET can demonstrate its n- and p-channel capability to be a viable and scalable complement to silicon CMOS.”  The Company’s proprietary POET platform has demonstrated monolithic fabrication of integrated circuit gallium arsenide (GaAs) based devices containing both electronic and optical elements on a single wafer.  By offering components with the potential for increased speed, density, reliability, and lower costs, POET offers the semiconductor industry the ability to push Moore’s Law to the next cadence level, overcoming current silicon-based bottlenecks, and potentially changing the roadmap for a broad range of applications.  - Completion of Milestone #8 "Demonstration of 100nm or below PET n- and p- channel device and ring oscillator (3rd party lab/line). It is important to note that this time "(3rd party lab/line)" has been used instead of "(3rd Party Fab)"!! This clearly indicated that by that time (+-Q4) that at least one PDA has been established, because a third party lab will have to do this validation. And the "line" part indicates that this can be done in mass-production.  - Contracts, Licenses & PDA's can be announced on any given day. Keep in mind that the stock will be halted, under Canadian law, which also affects the ADR (POETF). When a contract has $$ amounts attached to it the stock will open again on an adjusted basis, so for (swing) traders it can be dangerous if you sold your position just the day prior to a contract announcement... Just saying.  Mid to Long Term Goals Q1 & Q2 of 2014):  - Q1 2014, MS#9 "Integrated external modulator for Continious Wave Laser Demonstration (POET lab)".  - Q2 2014, MS#10 "Full Integration of Electronical and Optical Devices on Single Die (3rd Party Fab).  - Again, Contracts, Licenses & PDA's can be announced on any given day. And as we near the completion of the revolutionary POET Platform it can also be that a (hostile) buyout is offered. Although this total buyout can also come prior to the completion of POET. One just has to take a very promising pharmaceutical company with several products in development as example, that is bought out prior to completion of its pipeline products. This can happen to POET Technologies Inc. as well. (See Monetization Options below.)  Monetization Paths:  Several Options to Monetize POET: • POET is a research company, not a product company. • POET/PET are ready to enter the commercialization process. • No single company is currently active in all market areas where POET provides a best-inclass value proposition; syndicate needed to extract full value from technology platform.  Single Acquirer: • This path would involve selling POET to a single (by definition large) 3rd party. • Technology access/investment would likely be syndicated by acquirer. • Relatively small number of viable candidates.  Multiple Acquirers: • This path would involve selling POET to a syndicate (likely structured as a joint venture). • Ideal syndicate would include members with market presence in all key areas related to POET commercialization. Licensing: • Certain specialized market segments might be best addressed by licensing all or part of the POET/PET technology to one or more 3rd parties for use in a given market. • Can be complex with difficult-to-foresee implications for other activities.  * The Company is seeking to monetize the revolutionary POET platform as described above. In case its sold for $1 Billion this would equate to $5/share with Fully Diluted shares of 200 Million. (In Part 3 of the POET Presentation they expect to see +- $1 Billion).

Good morningThe new DenseLight product “SLED Sets” (Broadband Fiber-Coupled Light Sources) and scope of possible applications:  demonstrated by the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA:Apr. 2008 - A Combined Multiple-SLED Broadband Light Source at 1300 nm for High Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography - Method and resultsThe new combined broadband SLED source was generated by combing four SLEDs which were independently driven. To generate a broadband spectrum with the smallest ripples possible, each of the SLEDs was chosen according to their central wavelength and output power. The layout of the combination is shown in Fig. 1. S1325 (Inphenix, USA) has a central wavelength of 1325 nm, a full width half maximum (FWHM) bandwidth of about 70 nm, and an output power of 15 mW. S1325 has similar specifications as the SLEDs popularly used singly in OCT systems. SLED S1355 (Denselight, Singapore) has a central wavelength of 1350 nm, a FWHM bandwidth of 50 nm, and an output power of 15 mW. The third and fourth SLEDs (S1265 and S1380) were custom built by WT&T (Canada) and have center wavelength at 1265 nm and 1380 nm. The center wavelength of S1265 and S1380 can be tuned over a 10 nm range. The spectrum of each SLED is shown in Fig. 2(a).https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3858014/and demonstrated by School of Engineering & Department of Industrial Electronics, University of Minho, Portugal 15 May2013 - Photonic Sensors Based on Flexible Materials with FBGs for Use on Biomedical Applicationsplease see, on the left, Figure 2 ( Oplink and Ibsen Photonics are customer of DenseLight)This chapter presented biomedical applications for acquisition systems based on FBGs. The absence of mechanical steps on sensor’s fabrication results in the possibility to fabricate high sensitivity sensors with high reproducibility of their characteristics. However, the most important features that made FBG-based systems a wide established technology were their electrically passive operation, electromagnetic interference immunity, compact size, self referencing capability, and more important, inherent multiplexing-ability, which enable a wide number of sensors in a single fiber as well as Bragg a single interrogation systemhttp://www.intechopen.com/books/current-trends-in-short-and-long-period-fiber-gratings/photonic-sensors-based-on-flexible-materials-with-fbgs-for-use-on-biomedical-applicationsCheers

POET Technologies Provides Highlights from Annual General Meeting
Technology and Business Updates Focused on Proprietary Dielectric Hybrid Platform to Accelerate Revenue Growth



















July 17, 2017 09:00 ET

 | Source: POET Technologies Inc.






SAN JOSE, Calif., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- POET Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “POET”) (OTCQX:POETF) (TSX Venture:PTK), a developer of opto-electronic fabrication processes for the semiconductor industry provided shareholders with a review of its strategy, technology roadmap and product development activities during its Annual General Meeting of shareholders (“AGM”) held in San Jose, California on Thursday, July 13, 2017. POET’s Executive Chairman, David Lazovsky, conducted the formal business of the AGM, including the approval of all proposals outlined in the Company’s proxy material. POET’s CEO, Suresh Venkatesan, then presented a strategy, technology and product update.  In addition, Thomas Mika, CFO, updated shareholders on the Company’s communications policy and expiring Shareholder Rights Plan.  All three senior managers of POET participated in an extensive Q&A session.  The slides presented at the meeting along with a webcast replay can be accessed in the Investor Relations section of POET’s website at: http://www.poet-technologies.com/agm/agm2017.html Strategy and Technology Overview POET’s strategy is based on photonics integration (utilizing both monolithic and hybrid approaches) to lower cost and increase performance of disruptive solutions for the data communications and sensing markets, while focusing on the highest Return on Investment (ROI) opportunities available to the Company; Recent explosive growth in the market for Indium Phosphide (InP)-based solutions for data communications at 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) utilizing Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) provides an opportunity for POET to leverage its InP facility and production capability in Singapore, its unique and proprietary dielectric technology, and its wafer-level packaging expertise into a newly announced Hybrid Dielectric Photonics platform strategy; POET has demonstrated the functionality of its proprietary dielectric waveguides for multiplexing and de-multiplexing light signals, allowing for the development of an optical engine suitable for transceivers operating at 100 gigabits per second (Gbps); engineering samples of these devices are planned to be delivered to customers this quarter; POET is strategically allocating resources to capitalize on the rapidly growing InP Photonics market, which is estimated to grow to an $11 billion addressable market by 2021, in order to increase ROI, accelerate time to revenue and deliver shareholder value; Technical challenges related to the manufacturability of the monolithic GaAs platform, have delayed POET’s development of a Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)-based optical engine. The additional development time and cost associated with the GaAs platform will require the Company to secure a strategic partner in order to develop and commercialize this platform; POET announced that its Narrow Linewidth Laser products have demonstrated industry-leading performance with “super-wide” tunability for high resolution sensing applications, such as gas & chemical sensing, coherent communication, meteorological sensing and atmospheric LIDAR; additional developments, including the incorporation of dielectric waveguides and wafer-level packaging is expected to accelerate growth in the sensing product line in 2018 and beyond. AGM Highlights At the AGM, POET Technologies shareholders approved the following items: The current directors were re-elected as proposed, with each director receiving over 88% of the votes cast;Marcum LLP, Certified Public Accountants, of New Haven, Connecticut were reappointed as auditors of the Company for the ensuing year. Director Compensation In an effort to reduce cash expenses, and following a review of peer group companies, the POET Board of Directors recently revised its compensation. This included reducing the cash compensation paid to its Executive Chairman, and effective April 1, 2017, eliminating per-meeting fees and reducing the annual cash retainer paid to directors. In the recent past, the demands on the Board to address key strategic and operating challenges resulted in frequent and numerous meetings, with per-meeting fees representing a substantial portion of total director compensation. In the newly-adopted program, the Executive Chairman is paid US$200,000 annually. The annual cash retainer for each director is reduced to US$30,000 and each committee chairperson receives an additional annual retainer of US$10,000. The balance of director compensation is paid in stock options at a value of US$90,000 annually, plus US$10,000 per year in value of options to each committee chairperson. The valuation of options grants is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The awarded stock options for directors vest quarterly in arrears over one year to match the period of service provided by each director. Options Grant At the meeting of the Board of Directors following the AGM, as part of the Company’s incentive stock option grant program, options were granted to certain directors, officers and employees of the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 9,225,000 common shares, representing approximately 3.55% of the outstanding shares of the Company. Employees as a group 2,225,000Management as a group 4,000,000Directors as a group 3,000,000 The options are exercisable for 10 years at a price of CAD$0.28 (US$0.22) being the closing price of the Company’s shares on July 12, 2017.  The directors’ options vest quarterly in arrears over the one year of service as a director until the next Annual General Meeting. All other options granted to employees and management vest 25% on the first anniversary of the grant and the balance vests quarterly over a further three-year period thereafter.  The grant to the directors represents the option portion of directors’ fees for the 15-month period from April 1, 2017, when the cash fees were reduced, through the next AGM to be scheduled in approximately one year from the present. The options were granted subject to provisions of the Company’s stock option plan and are subject to the TSX Venture Exchange policies and applicable securities laws. For further details on the Company’s share capital, refer to the Company’s Financial Statements and MD&A for the 3-months ended March 31, 2017 which were filed on SEDAR on May 11, 2017.

This news release contains “forward-looking information” (within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws) and “forward-looking statements” (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). Such statements or information are identified with words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “expect”, “plan”, “intend”, “potential”, “estimate”, “propose”, “project”, “outlook”, “foresee” or similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Such statements include the Company’s expectations regarding its strategy, technology roadmap and product development activities. They also include the Company’s expectations with respect to the capability, functionality, performance and cost of the Company’s technology. Such forward-looking information or statements are based on a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions which may cause actual results or other expectations to differ materially from those anticipated and which may prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, management’s expectations regarding future growth, plans for and completion of projects by the Company’s third party relationships, availability of capital, and the necessity to incur capital and other expenditures.
