The iHelp has various features and functions, including a global positioning system (GPS), the ability to remotely locate a loved one, and a dealer portal that enables dealers to manage their own iHelp customer base.The iHelp dealer program is a turnkey program that offers the dealer the opportunity to provide his/her customers with various products without having to change his/her own backend.

Life Alert Very Bad Product,    Consumer Complaints & Reviews   For example, LifeAlert customers tell us that the company holds them to the three-year contract even if the elderly individual dies before the term is up.   A few recent complaints ...     http://www.consumeraffairs.com/age/lifealert.html     It is very difficult to cancel. After my mother died, they continued to bill. They never told us about returning the equipment when we canceled service. We live 400+ miles away and had to get the neighbor to help return equipment. They billed us for a supposed "pendant" that was missing and they are very argumentative on the phone. They are not a good company to do business with.   BAD PRODUCT    Life Alert has an extremely poor performance rating for me. It's not even worth a 1 star!   My mother who lived alone was a Life Alert customer, who never needed their service for any reason. A malfunction with their unit caused the local police to arrive one time, in the last 2 years. Now that my mother lives with me in a different city, she has no use for the Life Alert system. When I contacted them to cancel the service, I was told that she had to remain a customer for another year and deductions from her bank account would continue whether she uses the unit or not. I promptly contacted the bank to have the automatic withdrawals canceled and I was told that Life Alert would have to grant permission for the deductions to stop! Life Alert is taking advantage of senior citizens.   After using high pressure tactics to entice unsuspecting seniors to engage their service, they then impose unrealistic measures and penalties when an elderly person wants to discontinue their services. Life Alert charges 6 months worth of service charges as penalty on a population of our senior citizens who have the least amount of resources available to them, if they choose to cancel their service. In addition, I was later told by one of their officers that they require a minimum of 3 years service in order to terminate their service without penalty. This information is not explained upfront or posted online in any of their advertisements.   I was told over 3 weeks ago that they would mail a copy of their contract and they have not sent it to date (10.26.2011). In addition, I was told by one of their customer service representatives that the information about a mandatory 3 years' service or requirement that a person be deceased or enrolled in an "approved" nursing facility before any termination can take place without penalty is not written in their contract.   Life Alert has been fined in excess of $1 million dollars by the California State Consumer Protection Agency regarding the high pressure sales practices they use on the most vulnerable of our seniors. It is my opinion that Life Alert needs to be fined additionally for this unreasonable "price-gouging of seniors" if seniors choose to discontinue their service in less than 3 years.   Further, they seem to have power over the seniors' bank account as well. If the consumer wants to stop automatic online payments to Life Alert from their bank, they are told they would need to contact Life Alert to get permission to do so. If a bank customer can stop payment on a check; why can't the customer stop payments on automatic deductions especially when they are not satisfied with the vendor's service and no longer needs their service or the equipment which has proven to be faulty?

Looks like new iHelp+3G product is  becoming a winner-attracting big attention and significant impact in the medical alert industry, over the coming years. The stock is a proven looser as an investment and company financially a poster child for high risk investment and dubious management-not to leave out shady deals. What next?  Five cents or fifty cents?

 Thu, 06/09/2016 - 10:00am 
 Comments 
 by Wearable Health Solutions, Inc.  

 






Medical Alarm Concepts Holding, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based personal medical-alarm device manufacturer, has changed its name to Wearable Health Solutions, Inc.
According to the company, the name change more accurately reflects its shift in strategic direction to connected, mobile, and wearable IoT (Internet of Things) devices, as well as supporting services that provide scalable and evolving real-time personal protection, health information, and data-informed decision-making for healthcare institutions, patients and consumers.
"We plan to reveal a more complete view of the WHSI brand and an updated corporate website in connection with the change in our corporate name and strategic direction," Jennifer Loria, COO, said in a press statement.
The company provides mobile health (mHealth) products and services to global dealers and distributors. Products and services include medical alarm devices, wearable healthcare products, GPS and Bluetooth tracking services, and initiatives enabling users to be proactive with their health.
