Robert Allen Johnson













                    
                    After a three-year stint in Southeast Asia, Robert Allen Johnson returned to the States to pursue his dream of writing meaningful, emotional, historically-driven fiction. His first two novels, Rising Sun and Triumphator, were released to rave reviews in 2014. His third novel, Wraith, was released in November 2015. He lives in Indiana with his wife and two children.

 Wraith (Empire and The Hand) -Robert Allen Johnson


Fantasy Book Reviews. 
Where do I start with this one? What an amazing read. Wraith (Empire and The Hand), written by Robert Allen Johnson was engrossing from beginning to chilling end. It stands as a testament to Johnson that I, a Christmas nut, couldn’t stand not to finish it on Christmas Eve. Anyway, onto the review! 
Johnson manages to craft one of the most detailed worlds I think I’ve ever encountered, and that’s not small feat. The sheer amount of detail can be

 The Heart and Soul of a Wraith


Breaking down the ins and outs of Robert Allen Johnson’s latest novel Wraith.  
The news broke amid smiles and cheers. “Finally! You’ve kept us waiting long enough!” 
I wasn’t really sure how to proceed from there. Yes, a new book was definitely on the way for a Fall 2015 release. The only caveat? It wasn’t the one everyone was expecting. “Well, it’s not Foreign Shores. It’s something else. Something new.”

 Wraith, and the Audiobook on the Horizon


So here’s a bit of news that makes me incredibly excited: the wonderfully talented James Foster and I have agreed to terms on the production of an audiobook version of Wraith. James is a current SOVAS Voice Arts award finalist for three separate narration categories for some of his recent work. 
After hearing his work, I knew he was the one. I sent James a message asking him to audition for the job, listened to the first 8 minutes of the book he’d recorded, and was simply blo

 Wraith: Cover Reveal


One of my favorite moments in the overall creation of a book is the unveiling of the front cover. My old friend Asher Eggleston came back for the third time to help with its design and I absolutely love it!

 Wraith: Page One


There really is a lot of sighing involved in the composition of a novel. The first notable sigh comes as soon as that last sentence is keyed in. Another memorable one? Getting the final edit back and putting a satisfying stamp on the book’s insides. Although I’m still waiting for the final cover to head my way, I can pretty much say this book is, at long last, in its final hands-off state. 
Here’s Page One of Wraith for you. Check it out and make sure to order your copy

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Johnson Robert Allen Sr carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Johnson Robert Allen Sr currently holds license 2101170623 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Johnson Robert Allen Sr



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Hey Robert,
I like what people are saying about your books and I want to read them. I love ancient Rome! It is hard for me to find the books. I am able to find your first one "Rising Sun (Magnus, #1)" in barnes & noble but I can't seem to find the second one in the series "Triumphator (Magnus, #2)" . Is there a web site I can find it at?

Thanks for all of your work,
~LN

If you want to get a copy of Triumphator at B&N, you can either order it online here (http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/magnu...) or you can call your local branch and have them order a copy for you to pick up in-store. Depending on where you live, ordering it from Amazon may also be a faster option for you (http://www.amazon.com/MAGNUS-Triumpha...). Enjoy the books and have a great end to 2014!(less)

Robert’s Quotes



      “A story from beginning to end that might entertain, teach, or simply bore your listener. It's all in the delivery, my dear."He got a smug look on his face as he scooted his posterior deeper into the chair and took his pipe between his teeth. "I'm just better at it than most.”

The focus of this group is historical fiction set in Ancient and Medieval eras(with some post Medieval), in any geographical location. Preference is given to themes of: engaging politics, sprawling battles, drugs(errr .. mead) and debauchery. If authors like Robyn Young, Bernard Cornwell, Steven Pressfield resonate with you, this group is designed for you. If you are bursting in your seams to discuss their books, please do come in. 
AUTHORS welcome as READERS ONLY. Limited opportunity for self promotion exists in A&M!

No romantic melodrama books please. Want to gush about this great Victorian-era romance novel you've discovered and had been smitten with? Not the right group for you.

We encourage freedom of opinion on books and authors in this group. As long as the opinion is respectful and harmless and breaks no Group rules. Don't feel you can't be honest about a book or author. No matter how popular the book or author is.
Our Group Motto, courtesy of George S. Patton, is: 
If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.

Publishing is rich with hidden gems and diamonds-in-the-rough that belong to self-published, indie and otherwise underappreciated authors. 

** Please be aware before joining we DO NOT ALLOW AUTHORS TO SELF-PROMOTE BOOKS. All posts of that nature will be deleted without warning or hesitation. **

Our focus is recommending little known authors we're fans of and building a community amongst members who invest in this group. We support our own - readers and authors alike.

Fringe Fiction is devoted to those who admire self-published works and want an outlet to discuss under-the-radar books with readers eager to discover fresh talent by obscure authors. Indie aficionados who welcome such recommendations and are enthusiastic about giving them are encouraged to let members know what they might be overlooking in the lesser-known corners of publishing. 

The authors mentioned in Fringe Fiction won’t be household names and their books aren’t New York Times bestsellers but each of them have fans, a few of them followings and all could use extra word-of-mouth. If you ever read a great book you felt deserved more attention or wished an unknown author all the success in the world, then consider contributing here. 

Book discussions and recommendations are the purpose of this group; however, self-published/small press authors will have spaces and opportunities to make themselves known to other members. We’re all supportive fans – both existing and potential – so treat the avid readers of Fringe Fiction with the utmost respect and they’ll consider your work with similar courtesy. 

To those still reading and like-minded - welcome to the Fringe!

This group is dedicated to an appreciation of important works of literature, both classic and contemporary... that happen to fall into the category of Dark Fiction.

We tend to avoid the big, banal blockbusters (and the more lurid fare) in favor of beautifully written explorations of the unknown, many of them obscure, all of them extraordinary.

[Note from the Moderator: A couple of years ago, we changed our group name from "Literary Horror" in order to expand our sphere of interests (and dislodge a few embedded trolls). Our enthusiasms embrace Gothic, Weird Fiction, and Noir, as well as much that might be classified as Horror, but we also appreciate literary fiction that cannot be easily fitted into a marketing niche. In fact, this latter group of titles has evolved into our primary focus. Most serious fiction deals (to some extent) with darker themes, and many works of distinction have employed supernatural, surreal or existentialist elements. These books have power. They endure, because they appeal to serious readers and provide thoughtful entertainment. Come. Explore them with us.]
