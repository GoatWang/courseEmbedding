Update 06-08-17:
D’Allessandro Corp. has completed installation of the new water main along Phase 1A, approximately 1,700 feet of main.  The crews will begin switching buildings located within Phase 1A off of the temporary main and connecting each service to the newly installed water main within the roadway.  As the crews switch Phase 1A over to the new main, they will also begin switching the buildings located within Phase 1B to the temporary water main.  While each building is being switched over from one main to another, a temporary loss of water service should be expected.  This disruption of service should range from 1-2 hours as the crew completes the work.  After water service is restored, the highest faucet in each building should be run for 5-10 minutes to allow any air trapped in the pipes to work its way out of the line.
 
The City of Waltham has contracted D’Allessandro Corp. of Avon, MA to replace the water main along Bear Hill Road and Second Avenue. The project will include installing a temporary bypass water main, replacing approximately 8,000 feet of water main, 18 fire hydrants, and water services to buildings. The project will be completed in 2 phases. The limits of Phase 1 are from #50 Bear Hill Road to the intersection of Bear Hill Road and Second Avenue. Phase 2 consists of Second Avenue from Bear Hill Road to the intersection with Winter Street. Each Phase is broken into smaller sub-phases to minimize the disruption of service to residents. The project will consist of both night and day work during various phases. Daytime hours will be between 9:00AM – 4:00PM & Nighttime hours will be between 8:00PM – 5:00AM. During daytime hours there will be one traffic lane open in each direction, nighttime hours will close the road to one lane with alternating flow of traffic.
It is recommended that residents give extra time to allow for the delays in traffic during the project. Your patience is greatly appreciated. Please see the attached plan showing the different phases and their anticipated start and finish dates. A full set of plans may be viewed here.
If there are any questions or concerns please contact John Martino of the Engineering Department by phone (781) 314-3828, or email jmartino@city.waltham.ma.us.
