Nate’s Food Co. Announces Corporate Update on Product Development and Related Market | Business Wire


























































Nate’s Food Co. Announces Corporate Update on Product Development and 
      Related Market






November 11, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nate’s Food Co. (OTC: NHMD) provided a corporate update on its product 
      development and the related markets for these products. The Company will 
      be providing this information to grocery stores and other interested 
      parties.
    

Background. Nate’s Food Co. was created by 
      Nate Steck. Over the past 20 years, Nate Steck has started 5 different 
      food companies that have generated approximately $200 Million in revenue 
      and in which 3 of the companies were bought by other food companies. 
      Currently, Nate developed Nate’s Pancakes which is being sold by Nate’s 
      Food Co. Nate also created Batter Blaster which was sold in over 13,000 
      stores and grossed over $40 Million in sales. The market size for 
      pancakes and waffles (which includes frozen waffles/pancakes and dry 
      mixes) is approximately $1.1 Billion. Batter Blaster sold $40 Million or 
      approximately 3.7% of the total market size.
    

Flavor Extension. By increasing the product 
      line of Nate’s Pancakes to include flavor extensions, the Company would 
      expect to triple its total distributions points and thereby increasing 
      sales by 200%-300%.
    

One-Minute Omelet. The Company has begun 
      developing the One-Minute Omelet. The United States produces nearly 100 
      Billion eggs per year with sales in excess of $8.5 Billion per year. If 
      the Company is able to have the same revenue penetration as Batter 
      Blaster it would generate in excess of $300 Million in revenue.
    

Guacamole. The Company has begun developing 
      a guacamole product line. The market for avocados and guacamole is 
      approximately $3.5 Billion and in the United States nearly 1.3 Billion 
      avocados are consumed on Super Bowl weekend alone. If the Company is 
      able to have the same revenue penetration as Batter Blaster it would 
      generate in excess of $129 Million in revenue.
    

      Nate previously created product lines that focused on a single market. 
      However, with Nate’s Food the goal it to expand the Company’s product 
      line to include up to 10 products in the next year and to continually 
      expand the product line.
    

About Nate’s Food Co.


      Nate’s Food Co. manufactures and produces products under the Nate 
      Homemade brand. This includes Nate’s Pancakes. Nate’s Pancakes are a 
      ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a 
      pressurized can. Our pre-made batter makes light and airy pancakes or 
      waffles that are fun for the entire family to make together, and are a 
      great way to start your day. With no preparation and no clean-up, we’ve 
      made making breakfast easier for your busy mornings.
    

Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
      in this press release which are not purely historical are 
      forward-looking statements and include any statements regarding beliefs, 
      plans, expectations or intentions regarding the future. Actual results 
      could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due 
      to numerous factors. These forward-looking statements are made as of the 
      date of this news release, and we assume no obligation to update the 
      forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results

      contained in this press release are reasonable, there can be no 
      assurance that any such beliefs, plans, expectations or intentions will
