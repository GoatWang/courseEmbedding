Job Details
               Founded in 1891, New York Law School (NYLS) is an independent law school located in the heart of New York City's legal, government, financial, and emerging tech centers. Known as "New York's law school," NYLS embraces the City as its classroom by complementing a rigorous legal education with an innovative and diverse set of "uniquely New York" experiential learning opportunities. Since opening our doors nearly 125 years ago, we have produced graduates who have gone on to hold high elected and appointed office in the City, lead large and small firms, and gain broad recognition as captains of business and industry. Our renowned faculty of prolific scholars has built the School's strength in such areas as constitutional law, civil and human rights, business and finance law, media and information law, tax law, real estate, and a number of interdisciplinary fields. NYLS has more than 17,000 graduates and currently enrolls approximately 1,000 full-time and part-time students in its J.D. program. The Law School also offers advanced-degree programs in American Business Law and Tax Law.
