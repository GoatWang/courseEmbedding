				Cap Wood Products was started by John Cox in 1978 in a small and drafty garage in downtown Waukesha.  At first all work was don by John at night as he was an architectural draftsman by day.  Within a few years the demand for his work was so great that he quit his drafting job and worked full time on the architectural mill-work and furniture projects that were coming into his shop.In 1980 Cap Wood moved to a much larger facility on an old dairy farm that had been converted into manufacturing shops in Genesee Depot Wisconsin.  Shorty after that move, John and his growing company opened up their first showroom to display their handcrafted furniture. Dining room sets, entertainment centers and roll-top desks were just some of the pieces on display.Cap Wood was noticed by other small furniture makers and started contracting to manufacture other lines of furniture for furniture companies. At about that same time Cap Wood Product put out their own catalog of furniture designs and started selling through independent sales representatives in 8 states. It wasn't long before a larger shop was needed.  Late in 1988 we broke ground to construct our 14,500 square foot building.  CWP moved their operations in May 1098 to the facility in Waukesha, WI where we continue to design our unique creations.  With the added space, CWP brought in more machinery over the next few years in order to produce high quality furniture along with handcrafted custom cabinets and other wood components that customers had requested CWP to make.As of now, CWP has the capacity to manufacture, finish and package a large variety of projects ranging from the high end custom piece of furniture for the distinguishing customers to large runs of component parts for POP display distributors.  With John still at the wheel designing and overseeing the shop, CWP looks forward to helping all customers obtain the quality piece of furniture or cabinetry that they dream of.

XPreRip Terms and ConditionsPreRip is a free option on select CD's displaying the PreRip icon. This option allows you to download the MP3 version of that CD immediately after your purchase. The physical CD will still be shipped to you. If you agree to accept your PreRip MP3s, please be aware that the corresponding CD will be non-refundable and cannot be canceled from your order. This protects us against customers taking the free MP3 and then canceling the CD.PreRip availability may change at any time, so we recommend that you download as soon as possible.Should the CD you receive be defective, we will exchange it for a new one. PreRip is only available to customers in the United States. This is a limitation placed on us by the record labels.
