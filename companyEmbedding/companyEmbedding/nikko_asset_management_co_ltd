				Ethical Investing – Whose ethics are we talking about?			


by George Carter, Managing Director, Nikko Asset Management New Zealand Limited

Asia Investor Achievement Awards
	AsianInvestor ("AI") annual Awards for Achievement recognise fund houses that have  demonstrated skill in institutional fund management, as well as all-round excellence among hedge funds, service providers and domestic businesses. Nominations are based purely on past performance. AI does  however select winners on more qualitative factors so our awards reflect  consistent skill. For the Annual awards, the methodology for  AsianInvestor's Achievement Awards in institutional asset management involves two steps:

First: AI collects performance data from various consultants that is used to shortlist the top 3-4 candidates in each category. For one-year awards, AI looks at pure returns; for other awards, information ratios. AI picks the top three or four performers on that basis.
Step  two: AI asks the candidates to pitch themselves and provide some areas (such as sources of alpha, strategy, team experience, innovation, testimonials, etc) to consider. After than it is purely an editorial decision, based on the pitches.

Firms that have demonstrated consistent performance in a particular asset class may have an edge and AI also values client testimonials highly.
R&I Fund AwardThe R&I Fund Award is presented to provide reference information based on the past data R&I or QUICK Corp. (QUICK) believes to be reliable (however, its accuracy and completeness are not guaranteed by R&I or QUICK) and is not intended to recommend the purchase, sale or holding of particular products or guarantee their future performance. The Award is not the Credit Rating Business, but one of the Other Lines of Business (businesses excluding Credit Rating Business and also excluding the Ancillary Businesses) as set forth in Article 299, paragraph (1), item (xxviii) of the Cabinet Office Ordinance on Financial Instruments Business, etc. With respect to such business, relevant laws and regulations require measures to be implemented so that activities pertaining to such business would not unreasonably affect the Credit Rating Activities. Intellectual property rights including copyright and all other rights in this Award are the sole property of R&I or QUICK, and any unauthorized copying, reproduction and so forth are prohibited. The Award for the "Investment Trusts/Aggregate" category is based on the average performance of the relevant funds of a fund manager, and does not indicate the excellent performance of all individual funds of the manager.

At Nikko AM, we believe that corporate governance is a critical management issue. For many years, we have had an independent board – which includes independent directors – as well as a clear delineation between the board, oversight control functions and executive responsibilities. We consider this structure to be distinctive in Asia and necessary for maintaining the confidence of our shareholders.
Since 2003, Nikko AM has provided employees with an ownership stake in our company, which we believe has enhanced the independence of management, contributed to our relatively low turnover, and helped align the firm’s goals with those of our employees.

Nikko AM Hires Mr. Thomas Juterbock




~ Expands Its Fixed Income 
      Expertise with His Global Macro Strategy ~






May 01, 2007 05:22 AM Eastern Daylight Time



TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nikko Asset Management Co., Ltd. (“Nikko AM 
      Tokyo”) (Timothy F. McCarthy, Chairman and 
      CEO) announced today the appointment of Thomas Juterbock as Senior 
      Portfolio Manager at Nikko Alternative Asset Management Inc., a New 
      York-based subsidiary of Nikko AM Tokyo. Mr. Juterbock will be a member 
      of Nikko AM(a) ’s Global Investment Committee 
      and will report to Masayuki Ishihara, Global Head of Fixed Income. Mr. 
      Juterbock assumed this role on March 30, 2007.
    

      Prior to joining Nikko AM, Mr. Juterbock acted as founder, principal 
      owner, CEO and CIO of Fairstream Capital hedge fund management group 
      from August 2006, where he developed a proprietary financial conditions 
      model. At Nikko AM, Mr. Juterbock and his Fairstream team of six will 
      seek ways to employ Fairstream’s global macro 
      investment process to the broader array of Nikko AM products, while 
      helping to expand Nikko AM’s product offerings 
      worldwide.
    

      Mr. Juterbock has over 20 years of experience in trading and risk 
      management at Morgan Stanley, where he was a Managing Director from 
      January 1990 to May 2005. While at Morgan Stanley, Mr. Juterbock managed 
      a variety of trading businesses, including global government bonds and 
      repo trading, collateral mortgage-backed securities trading, and U.S. 
      Agency trading. Mr. Juterbock also worked as a Senior Government Bond 
      Trader at Bank of America and as head of proprietary global relative 
      value trading at Ritchie Capital. He is a member of the U.S. Treasury 
      Borrowing Advisory Committee. He received his B.A. in Economics from the 
      University of California at Berkeley.
    

      Mr. Juterbock said, “I am thrilled to join the 
      Nikko AM team. With the line between ‘traditional’ 
      and ‘alternative’ 
      investment blurring and with the shifting demographics of investment 
      flows, international asset management is at a very interesting 
      crossroads. I see Nikko AM as uniquely positioned to capitalize upon 
      these trends and I look forward to working with the Nikko AM team to 
      help realize the full potential of this new opportunity set.”


      Commenting on Mr. Juterbock’s appointment, 
      Masayuki Ishihara said, “We are extremely 
      excited to welcome Mr. Juterbock and his team to the firm. We view his 
      deep experience in global bond markets and the team’s 
      ability to bring innovation to the Nikko AM product mix as enabling us 
      to proactively meet the evolving demands of our global customer base. 
      Nikko AM is now superbly positioned to develop and deliver extraordinary 
      value to our clients and shareholders.”


      (a)"Nikko AM” stands for Nikko Asset 
      Management Co., Ltd. and its group companies.

      AM”


      Nikko AM1 is a leading asset management group 
      headquartered in Japan. Established over 45 years ago, Nikko Asset 
      Management Co., Ltd. (“Nikko AM Tokyo”) 
      has been offering investors a full array of investment management 
      products and advisory services. Its investment trusts are distributed

      top-performing, independent asset managers over a diverse range of asset 
      classes.
    

      Nikko AM International Inc., our overseas office located in New York, 
      provides a wide range of products lineup, under in-house management such 
      as Global bond, and sub-advisory management, capitalizing on the 
      excellent performance of external asset management firms.
    

      In February 2005, Nikko AM’s expertise in 
      asset management was recognized when Nikko AM Tokyo received the Lipper 
      Award for Best Fund Group, based on its outstanding performance in three 
      asset class categories: equity funds, fixed income funds and mixed asset 
      funds. In April 2006, Nikko AM won Asian Investor’s 
      2006 Achievement Award in Japan Equity in the five year risk-adjusted 
      performance category.

      a Nikko AM company, provides alternative investment expertise and 
      solutions to its investors. NAAM provides investors access to internally

      line of products. NAAM’s alternative 
      investment experience spans over a decade.
