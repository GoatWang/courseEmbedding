A family of five said they were unfairly kicked off a JetBlue flight earlier this month without a reason.






Conservative commentator Ann Coulter publicly shamed Delta on Twitter last week after she said she was forced to give up a seat with extra room that she paid for.
United Airlines reached an “amicable” settlement in April with a doctor who went viral after he was forcibly removed from a flight, sustaining significant facial injuries.
It’s a combination of the rising prominence of social media and a near-monopoly of the airline industry that is contributing to the growing news of airline customers being unduly inconvenienced as they travel, attorney Arthur Alan Wolk, who specializes in aviation law, told Fox News.
These incidents are “happening more because airlines feel that they’re empowered to abuse their passengers more and feel that there are no consequences,” Wolk said.
“The reality is, if you need to go from Philadelphia to San Diego, and there’s only one airline that flies you there, the fact that they may have mistreated a passenger, including yourself, is not going to prevent you from taking that flight,” he added. “Once you have a monopoly, you have no incentive to give good customer service, treat people fairly and perform in a manner that you would be expected to perform if there was competition.”



UNITED AIRLINES CONTROVERSIES
Wolk says that chances of the airline industry improving for customers is bleak, even “nill.”
“The only way to really improve it…is to have competition,” Wolk said. “The only other thing that works, I’m loathe to say, is for the regulatory environment to tighten up the service regulations that apply to the airlines.”
Read on for a look at some recent airline controversies.
‘Dachshund-legged woman’
In a series of tweets, Coulter slammed Delta for giving away her seat to another woman on a flight from New York to West Palm Beach on July 15.
Coulter later told Fox News that as she was boarding, a “ticket agent snatched the ticket out of” her hand and informed her that her seat had changed due to an “emergency.”
She said that she sat in the original seat anyway until she was told to move by a stewardess who was not able to give an explanation for the seat change.
“[The other passenger] was not an elderly person, was not a sickly person, a very tall person,” Coulter said.
Wolk said Coulter’s situation is indicative of another problem with airlines – the seat pitch.
AIRLINE DIDN’T ALLOW BLIND MAN, GRANDDAUGHTER ON PLANE
As airlines have decreased the seat pitch – the “area between the back of the seat in front of you and where your back rests in your seat,” Wolk explained –  there has been an increase in safety concerns.
In an emergency situation, should the person in the aisle seat be injured and unable to move, other passengers could be stuck in their rows or have to climb over other seats or people, he said.
Party of five

Hey @Delta, you mind telling me why it was an "emergency" to move someone else into the seat I had carefully chosen in advance and booked?— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 15, 2017



So glad I took time investigate the aircraft & PRE-BOOK a specific seat on @Delta, so some woman could waltz at the last min & take my seat.— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 15, 2017



Suckiest @Delta moved me from my PRE-BOOKED SEAT & gave it to some woman, not elderly, child, or sick. I have pictures so don’t lie, @Delta!— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 16, 2017



.@Delta employee questionnaire: What is your ideal job: Prison guard? Animal handler? Stasi policeman? All of the above: HIRED!— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 16, 2017


A family of five said they were unfairly kicked off of a JetBlue flight on July 2 after a confrontation with an airline employee.
Tamir and Mandy Raanan said they were traveling from Fort Lauderdale to New York with their three young daughters – one of whom had kicked the back of another passenger’s seat.
ARE AIRLINE EMPLOYEES BECOMING UNHINGED?

Hey @Delta, if it was so important for the dachshund-legged woman to take my seat, she should have BOOKED THE SEAT IN ADVANCE. Like I did.— Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 16, 2017


Mandy said she apologized to the other passenger, but the family was still asked to leave the plane.
But JetBlue said in a statement that the incident was not as innocent as described.
“After a verbal altercation that included physical threats and profanities against a nearby customer, the aircraft door was reopened and our airports team politely asked the customers to step off to discuss the situation,” JetBlue said.
The airline thanked its employees for their “professional handling” of the situation and said it would “investigate whether the customers’ behavior warrants restrictions on JetBlue travel” in the future.
Quite the ‘erreur’
Lucie Bahetoukilae, who only speaks French, handed her ticket to an airline employee and boarded a plane in Newark, N.J., thinking the next stop would be Paris. When she got to her seat and found another woman in it, a flight attendant sat her in an empty seat.
Nearly 3,000 miles later, Bahetoukilae touched down in San Francisco.
In what United Airlines deemed a “horrible failure” in May, Bahetoukilae boarded the wrong plane after her flight’s gate switched at the last minute. She said the announcement wasn’t made in French, and she didn’t receive an email notifying her of the gate change.
Once in San Francisco, Bahetoukilae had to wait 11 hours before United was able to get her on the correct flight to France.
MAN WITH PROSTHETIC LEG CLAIMS AIRLINE FORCED HIM TO MOVE
Diane Miantsoko, the woman’s niece, told WABC-TV that she was worried about United’s security protocol.
"With everything going on in this country people have to be more careful," Miantsoko said. "They didn't pay attention. My aunt could have been anyone. She could have been a terrorist and killed people on that flight and they didn't know they didn't catch it."
United apologized for the mistake in a statement and said it is “working with our team in Newark to prevent this from happening again.”
Whose seat is it, anyway?
Delta apologized after a California couple and their two children were booted from the overbooked plane when the parents refused to give up an extra seat they had purchased.
Brian Schear said he, his wife and two children boarded a flight from Maui to Los Angeles on April 23 and were asked to give up an additional seat they had purchased for their older son who had ended up taking a different flight. Since their older son wasn’t present, Schear said the family planned to use his seat for one of the younger children.
AIRLINE COMPLAINTS DOWN LAST YEAR DESPITE MORE BUMPING INCIDENTS
But the flight was overbooked, and Schear was asked to give up the seat. When the family refused, they were made to leave the plane. The family booked new tickets home on another airline. 
“We are sorry for the unfortunate experience our customers had with Delta, and we’ve reached out to them to refund their travel and provide additional compensation,” the airline said at the time.
‘I’d rather go to jail’
Dr. David Dao was seated on a United fight in Chicago bound for Louisville on April 9 when he was asked to give up his seat on an overbooked flight to make room for crew members.
Dao refused, explaining that he is a doctor who needed to be at work the next morning at 8 a.m.
“I’m not going,” Dao repeatedly said. “I’d rather go to jail.”
Disturbing cell phone footage showing Dao being dragged off the plane, seemingly unconscious, by security officials went viral. During the altercation, Dao suffered a concussion, lost two of his teeth and broke his nose, his attorney said.
Dao and United “reached an amicable settlement” later in April.
“We look forward to implementing the improvements we have announced, which will put our customers at the center of everything we do,” United said in a statement at the time of the settlement.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Renowned songwriter, singer, and wife of Waylon Jennings writes an intimate, enormously entertaining memoir of American music, of life with Waylon and the Outlaws, and of faith lost and found.The daughter of a Pentecostal evangelist and a race-car driver, Jessi Colter played piano and sang in church before leaving Arizona to tour with rock-n-roll pioneer Duane Eddy, whom she married. Colter became a successful recording artist, appearing on American Bandstand and befriending stars such as the Everly Brothers and Chet Atkins, while her songs were recorded by Nancy Sinatra, Dottie West, and others. Her marriage to Eddy didnt last, however, and in 1969 she married the electrifying Waylon Jennings. Together, they made their home in Nashville which, in the 1970s, was ground zero for roots music, drawing Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Shel Silverstein, and others to the Nashville Sound. And Jessi was at the center of it all, the only woman on the landmark Wanted: The Outlaws album, therecord that launched the Outlaw Country genre and was the first country album to go platinum. She also tasted personal commercial success with the #1-single "Im Not Lisa."But offstage, life was a challenge, as Waylon pursued his addictions and battled his demons. Having drifted from the church as a young woman, Jessi returned to her faith and found in it a source of strength in the turmoil of living with Waylon. In the 1980s, Waylon helped launch the super group The Highwaymen with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson, and the hits kept rolling, as did Waylons reckless living. Amid it all, Jessi faithfully prayed for her husband until finally, at Thanksgiving 2001, Waylon found Jesus, just months before he died. An Outlaw and a Lady is a powerful story of American music, of love in the midst of heartache, and of faith that sustains.

                This review was written for An Outlaw and a Lady: A Memoir of Music, Life with Waylon, and the Faith that Brought Me Home.
            
 
            Waylon Jennings. Even if you think you dont know his music, if you ever watched the television show, The Dukes of Hazzard, you heard him sing the theme song, and play the part of the narrator.  In this book, his wife Jessi Colter (also known as Miriam Eddy) tells what life was like living with him.  She also shares her life story as well.


Waylon was a trial to live with, and he didnt try to hide the one night stands he sometimes indulged inespecially when he was on the road.  He was a drug user, especially pep pills and cocaine.  Although Jessi loved him deeply, and he loved her, that wasnt enough to give her the strength to be married to him.  In fact, she did separate from him once, and spent much time in prayer about whether or not to stay in the relationship.  Jessi knew that if she went back to him, she would be going back to stay with him for life.  Ultimately, she did make the decision to reunite with Waylon.  She returned to a life that had some amazing experiences but also some really rough times.   Jessi credits two things for getting through it.  Number one was having faith in God along with His help.  The other thing was expressing her feelings through music that she was creating. 


Jessi is a singer and composer in her own right.  She might be best known for the song, Im Not Lisa, which was a huge hit in the 1970s.  But she is a prolific writer of many other songs, and has recorded a number of albums.  She was part of albums that included Waylon and many of their famous friends.  Many well-known people have also sung her songs.  Over the years, they often rubbed shoulders, along with calling them friends, with such people as Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristoffersonjust to name a few.


The journey Jessi was on after she made the decision to stay married to Waylon would include his attempts to give up using drugs, and his great desire to have a child with her.  Waylon had some very big musical successes during this time, and she often toured with him around the world.  However Jessis one desire was that Waylon would accept Jesus Christ as his savior, and become a born again Christian.  This book tells the story of whether or not Jessi got her hearts desire, along with a whole lot more about their life together--because when she returned to Waylon, she stayed married to him. 


I was intrigued by the story of Jessi and Waylons relationship, and believe anyone else would be as well.  I really appreciated the Christian aspect that Jessi included in this book, and the importance she placed on Waylons salvation.  Anyone who likes biographies, stories about popular entertainers, or literature written from a Christian viewpoint will enjoy this 5-star book.


Thomas Nelson Publishers has provided bookreadingtic with a complimentary copy of An Outlaw and a Lady, for the purpose of review.  I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255.
