Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no 
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The 
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of 
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the 
full $60,000 as anticipated.

Gross proceeds                 $30,000   $45,000   $60,000
Offering expenses            $   7,000 $   7,000 $   7,000

PCs and Software Purchase    $   9,200 $   9,700 $  10,700
Specialist’s salary                  -    12,000    12,000
Marketing and advertising    $   1,000 $   2,000 $  11,000
SEC reporting and compliance $  10,000 $  10,000 $  10,000
Miscellaneous expenses       $     300 $     800 $   3,300

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Homero Giovanni 
Penaherrera Zavala, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the 
Company funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be 
necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement
our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC 
Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for 
trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. However, Mr. Penaherrera Zavala 
has no obligation to loan such funds to us and that there is no guarantee that 
he will loan such funds to us. Mr. Penaherrera Zavala will not be paid any 
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due 
date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Penaherrera Zavala. 
Mr. Penaherrera Zavala will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when 
we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Winning customers will be critical to our ability to grow our business. We are a
new and un-established company, have a weak competitive position in the industry
and have not yet earned any revenues.  We have an operational loss of $6,649
from December 20, 2012 (date of inception) to June 30, 2013. We need capital to
carry out our current business plan.  We also anticipate that we will require
additional financing in order to execute our business plan. We may not have
sufficient financing to sustain our current operations.  Many of the companies
with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those
available to us.  It is uncertain whether services offered by us will achieve
and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.

The market competition of city of Quito can be evaluated as a high. There are
several large well-established architectural companies which provide similar
service for large scale projects. That is why we plan to concentrate in small
and middle-scale sized projects. Our competitors include all architectural and
interior design companies offering service in both commercial and residential
design throughout Ecuador/South America. In order to be more or less successful
in the existing stiff condition we will provide a new vision of modern single
family houses which are characterized by using brand-new materials, environment
friendly technologies and out of the ordinary appearance. Also we plan to create
some typed projects  with standard type of plan layouts and number of spaces and
which can be constructed in different areas with different surroundings and
which can cost much less. Finally we will make competitive price for our work in
order to get more clients.

Altair International Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market
penetration to date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many
participants in the business of providing architectural services. Many
established, yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of
providing such services.  Nearly all Altair International Corp.'s competitors
have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and
managerial capabilities than us. We are, consequently, at a competitive
disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a successful
company in the interior design and architectural visualization industry.
Therefore, Altair International Corp. may not be able to establish itself within
the industry at all.


Company Description
Altair International Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December
20, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. We do not have revenues,
have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a
development-stage company formed to commence operations in the field


 of concept
architectural, interior design projects and related areas in Ecuador. We have
recently started our operation.

---

We plan to commence operations in architectural field and to be responsible for
the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well
as municipal organized public areas. Also, we intend to provide interior design
and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation
services and plan on using advanced computer technology to produce photo
realistic 3D rendering, walk-through animation and 360 degree panorama. In the
next 12 months after completion of our offering we intend to offer our services
to clients in Ecuador. Working from sketches to fully detailed plans, we plan to
create high detail, high quality three-dimensional renderings. Our images and
animations can be used for design and planning, development, property sales,
buildings, and the effective communication of concepts to clientele. Mr.
Penaherrera Zavala will perform our design services. We anticipate that our
potential clients or client agencies will execute contracts with us regarding
our services in architectural field. We are going to work with wide range of
clients from usual family which wants to upgrade or renovate their home to city
municipalities with appropriate project scale demand. After full payment, our
clients will own the copyrights for our renderings and designs.  

The company’s revenues will be what we charge our clients for our services.
Price of design project will depend on a project scale and will be calculated
individually. We expect to find clients mostly for residential projects.
However, we anticipate occasionally being involved in bigger commercial
projects. For smaller and simpler projects the price will be approximately 10 %
of total building costs. For bigger and more complicated we plan to charge
$30-40 per square meter. This price range depends on:

- Size of the building (unit)

- Color combinations

- Material and finishes required

- Number of views

- Complexity of rendering

Thus, the fully detailed blue prints documentation of all areas, details and
decorative elements of a single family house with a size of 250 square meters
will cost $7,500-$10,000. We plan to create a unique design for every new
project and also offer alternative choices of the design view. Then, after
finishing concept of project we will develop the architectural sketches and
further the blue-print documentation which are going to include fully developed
layouts, crossings and detailed information about every space of designed area.
For every project we will create 3d-models of the design object in all steps
from the concept to the fully detailed plans. Modeling, rendering and final
visual presentation will be included in our service. In addition, we plan
provide consulting regarding materials, furniture choice and supply to our
clients during full period of construction. We also intend to manage the working
relationship and communication between our clients and builders. We will provide
our clients with complete drawings packages in either electronic or hard copy
formats.

We intend to provide several basic types of work:

Interior design projects

We plan to offer complex projects of interior design of most important living
spaces inside the building. By our philosophy, it is very important to suggest
our clients the professional vision of living areas where they will spend their
daily live. That project usually includes blue-prints, detailed sketches,
3d-visualisation, rendering, finish material and furniture choose and
construction process supervising.

Architectural projects

We intend to provide architectural design services like building and structural
design, architectural drafting, architectural drawing, architectural lighting,
plans, cost estimation, layering, 3D modeling and architectural renderings that
will show case single buildings, sites or structures, exterior or interior,
color and texture of proposed materials, and the relationship with the
surrounding buildings and landscape. Architectural renderings are convincing
marketing tools to visualize and demonstrate certain aspects of a future
building or apartment to its buyers. We intend to concentrate on concept
architectural projects of new private and renovate building projects with
further sketches and blue-prints documentation development. Also we plan to be
involved in projects of public buildings and areas.

Landscape architectural projects

As well as working with private clients we also plan to work with more
complicated landscape architectural projects. Landscape architecture is the
design of outdoor public areas, organized green spaces in the cities, landmarks,
and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic
outcomes.

3d modeling

Hand-drawings and written explanations of the architectural and design ideas are
not enough for fully detailed projects. Therefore, in all steps of our projects
we will provide fully detailed 3D-renderings and 3D virtual reality
architectural animations (also known as walk-through or fly-through animations),
a short architectural movies created on a computer. With 3D walk-through any
specific viewpoint can be viewed from any angle or height giving a real
photorealistic feeling. Some of the advantages of virtual 3D walk-through are:  

 - Actual structure, architecture and building materials can be shown;

 - It brings a possibility to explore and experiment with colors, textures, and
   other architectural details;

 - External/Internal lighting such as natural lighting, based upon window
   direction, time of year and time of day can be previewed;

 - 3D Architectural animation will include exterior features such
   as landscaping, trees, hedges, fences;

 - Multiple design options can be explored and resolved before building begins.

We maintain our statutory registered agent's office at 2360 Corporate Circle, 
Suite 400, Henderson, Nevada 89074. Our business office is located at Conjunto 
Sierra Morena Casa D9, Tumbaco, Ecuador. Our telephone number is (702) 605-0043.

	Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
	Statements



	 



	Information included in this Form 10-Q contains
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”),
	and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). This information may involve known
	and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Altair International
	Corp. (the “Company”), to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied
	by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe future plans, strategies
	and expectations of the Company, are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,” “should,”
	“expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” or “project”
	or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are
	based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and there can be no assurance that these projections included in these forward-looking
	statements will come to pass. Actual results of the Company could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
	statements as a result of various factors. Except as required by applicable laws, the Company has no obligation to update publicly
	any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.



	 


	*

	Please note that throughout this Quarterly
	Report, and unless otherwise noted, the words "we," "our," "us," the "Company," or "ATAO"
	refers to Altair International Corp.

	Notes
	to the Financial Statements






	December
	31, 2016






	(Unaudited)






	 






	NOTE
	1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS






	Organization
	and Description of Business





	 




	ALTAIR INTERNATIONAL
	CORP. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 20, 2012. The Company’s
	physical address is 20704 N 90

	th

	Place, Scottsdale, AZ 85254. The Company is in the development stage as defined under
	Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 915-205 "Development-Stage
	Entities.”




	 




	The Company
	has entered into a strategic alliance with Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation (“CURE”), a California company engaged
	in the development of oral thin film (“OTF”) for the delivery of nutraceutical, over-the-counter and prescription
	products. Initially this alliance was comprised of an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil
	(commonly known as Viagra) Products throughout Asia, Brazil, the Middle East and Canada acquired at a cost of $200,000 while a
	joint venture agreement for the procurement of converting and packaging equipment specific for oral thin film products was proposed
	through a Letter of Intent. In addition, Altair and Cure agreed to enter into further joint ventures or other business relationships
	for the purpose of completing the development and marketing of additional products, and for license and distribution agreements
	for additional Cure products such as aspirin, sleep-aid, topical muscle and joint pain relief, and electrolytes delivered through
	OTF or other methods. Altair advanced $360,000 to CURE in this regard.




	 




	On September
	23, 2016, the Company and CURE agreed to terminate the Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil
	Products due to the unanticipated costs of obtaining regulatory approvals for the introduction of these pharmaceutical products
	into the licensed markets. In its place, the Company and CURE agreed to replace it with an Exclusive License and Distribution
	Agreement for a family of sports related nutraceutical products including a topical active for joint and muscle pain and OTF products
	for delivery of electrolyte, energy, sleep and recovery actives, The Company will become the exclusive worldwide distributor for
	these products. The fee for this new Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement was $560,000, comprised of the $200,000 fee
	paid for the Sildenafil agreement and the $360,000 advanced as a deposit for future license and distribution agreements.




	 




	The Company
	had previously planned to commence operations in the architectural field and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision
	of future private and public buildings as well as municipal organized public areas. This plan was abandoned in the 2015 fiscal
	year in favor of the business operations described above.




	 




	Since inception
	(December 20, 2012) through December 31, 2016, the Company has not generated any revenue and has accumulated losses of $298,430.




	 




	In
	management’s opinion all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been made,
	and that all adjustments have been made to maintain the books in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, sufficient disclosures have
	been made in order to ensure that the interim financial statements will not be misleading.




	 









	 


	F-

	NOTE
	2 - GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets
	and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.  The Company has incurred losses
	since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $298,430 as of December 31, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in
	the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or
	obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when
	they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans
	from directors and/or private placement of common stock. 




	 





	NOTE
	3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	Basis of
	Presentation





	 




	The accompanying
	financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
	and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and reflect all adjustments,
	consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which management believes are necessary to fairly present the financial position,
	results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the nine month periods ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 and
	year ending March 31, 2016.




	 





	Cash and
	Cash Equivalents





	 




	For purposes
	of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three
	months or less to be cash equivalents.




	 




	The Company's
	bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions. The funds are insured up to $250,000. At December 31, 2016 the Company's
	bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts.




	 





	Basic and
	Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share





	 




	The Company
	computes loss per share in accordance with “ASC-260”, “Earnings per Share” which requires presentation
	of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
	net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted
	loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share
	excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.




	 





	Income Taxes





	 




	The Company
	follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
	are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values
	and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences).  The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities
	of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.




	 





	Fair Value
	of Financial Instruments





	 




	FASB ASC 820
	"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs
	in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring
	fair value are observable in the market.




	 




	These tiers
	include:




	 




	Level 1: defined
	as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;




	 




	Level 2:
	defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable;
	and




	 




	Level 3:
	defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own
	assumptions.




	 




	The carrying
	amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values because of the
	short maturity of these instruments.



	 








	 


	F-

	6



	 







	 






	Use of Estimates





	 




	The preparation
	of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
	the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual
	results could differ from those estimates.






	 





	NOTE 4 –
	SALES AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE





	 




	On November
	26, 2014, the Company entered into a license and distribution agreement with Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation (“Cure”)
	for the exclusive rights to distribute and sell in certain defined territories any product produced and supplied by Cure that
	contains Sildenafil delivered through an oral thin film. The defined territories included Asia, Brazil, the Middle East and Canada.
	For the sake of clarity, Asia was further defined as India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Philippines, and those
	other countries dependent on China’s SDA certification for their approval protocol of the Products. There was no expiry
	date to this agreement. The agreement required that the Company pay to Cure a fee in the aggregate amount of $200,000, payable
	in two equal $100,000 instalments. The Company completed the purchase of the license in the 2015 fiscal year.




	 




	On September
	23, 2016, the Company and CURE agreed to terminate the Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil
	Products due to unanticipated costs of obtaining regulatory approvals for the introduction of these pharmaceutical products into
	the Asian markets and to replace it with an Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for a family of sports related nutraceutical
	products including a topical active for joint and muscle pain and OTF products for delivery of electrolyte, energy, sleep and
	recovery actives, The Company will become the exclusive worldwide distributor for these products. The fee for this new Exclusive
	License and Distribution Agreement was $560,000, comprised of the $200,000 fee paid for the Sildenafil agreement and the $360,000
	advanced as a deposit for future license and distribution agreements. This Agreement has a ten year term and requires minimum
	product orders of $1,500,000 in the first 24 month from the effective date of the Agreement and $1,500,000 for each year thereafter.




	 





	NOTE 5 –
	ADVANCES AND DEPOSITS





	 




	The Company
	and Cure agreed to enter into further joint ventures or other business relationships for the purpose of completing the development
	and marketing of additional products and for license and distribution agreements for additional Cure products. To September 23,
	2016 the Company had advanced $360,000 to Cure for these purposes. As described in Note 4 above, these advances were applied to
	the $560,000 fee payable to CURE for the Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for sports related nutraceutical products,
	leaving a balance of $nil at December 31, 2016 ($360,000 as at December 31, 2015).

	NOTE 6 –
	PROMISSORY NOTES





	 




	On March 6,
	2015, the Company executed a convertible promissory note for $100,000 with Williams Ten, LLC. The note was due in ninety days,
	had a $10,000 one-time interest payment due at maturity and required the issuance of 10,000 shares of common stock. Any unpaid
	principal and interest at the end of the term was convertible into shares of common stock at 50% of the average closing price
	for the ten days prior to the end of the term of the note. The fair value of the common stock issued was determined to be $9,091
	based on its fair value relative to the fair value of the debt issued. This amount was recorded as a debt discount and was to
	be amortized utilizing the interest method of accretion over the term of the note. In addition, due to the variable nature of
	the conversion feature which has no explicit limit on the number of shares that could be required to be issued, the company bifurcated
	the conversion feature and accounted for it as a derivative liability. The Company recorded the derivative liability at its fair
	value of $100,004 based on the Black Scholes Merton pricing model and a corresponding debt discount of $90,909 and derivative
	expense charge of $9,095. On September 29, 2016, Williams Ten, LLC agreed to cancel this Promissory Note and accept a new Convertible
	Promissory Note in the amount of $121,000, which included all accrued interest and penalties. This Convertible Promissory Note
	bears interest at the rate of 6.00% per annum and has a one year term. The Holder is entitled to convert any or all of the principal
	amount of this Note and any accrued interest, late fee, and extension fee, if applicable, into such number of shares of the Company’s
	shares of common stock, par value $.0001 (the “Common Stock”) as is obtained by dividing the entire principal amount
	of this Note plus any accrued interest by $0.01 per share. On October 3, 2016, the Company converted $10,000 of the principal
	balance into 1,000,000 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2016, $111,000 remains outstanding; and the Company fair valued
	the derivative at $71,105 resulting in a gain on the change in the fair value of $24,645.




	 




	On September
	29, 2016, the Company issued a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $13,850 to Strips Nutrition, Inc. as consideration
	for $13,850 in cash advances to the Company. This Convertible Promissory Note bears interest at the rate of 6.00% per annum and
	has a one year term. The Holder is entitled to convert any or all of the principal amount of this Note and any accrued interest,
	late fee, and extension fee, if applicable, into such number of shares of the Company’s shares of common stock, par value
	$.0001 (the “Common Stock”) as is obtained by dividing the entire principal amount of this Note plus any accrued interest
	by $0.01 per share. The company bifurcated the conversion feature and accounted for it as a derivative liability. The Company
	recorded the derivative liability at its fair value of $10,960 based on the Black Scholes Merton pricing model and a corresponding
	debt discount of $10,960 to be amortized utilizing the interest method of accretion over the term of the note.




	 




	As of December
	31, 2016, the Company fair valued the derivative at $8,872 resulting in a gain on the change in the fair value of $2,088. In addition,
	$2,763 of the debt discount has been amortized to interest expense.




	 




	On September
	29, 2016, the Company issued a Convertible Promissory Note in the principal amount of $13,768.89 to Mr. Fred Lee as consideration
	for $13,768.89 in travel expenses incurred in assessing distribution opportunities in Asia for the Company. This Convertible Promissory
	Note bears interest at the rate of 6.00% per annum and has a one year term. The Holder is entitled to convert any or all of the
	principal amount of this Note and any accrued interest, late fee, and extension fee, if applicable, into such number of shares
	of the Company’s shares of common stock, par value $.0001 (the “Common Stock”) as is obtained by dividing the
	entire principal amount of this Note plus any accrued interest by $0.01 per share. The company bifurcated the conversion feature

	Our Business





	Altair International Corp. (“Altair”)
	is a development stage company that was incorporated in Nevada on December 20, 2012.


	The Company entered into a strategic alliance with Cure Pharmaceutical
	Corporation (“CURE”), a California company engaged in the development of oral thin film (“OTF”) for the
	delivery of nutraceutical, over-the-counter and prescription products. Initially this alliance was comprised of an Exclusive License
	and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra) Products throughout Asia, Brazil, the Middle
	East and Canada acquired at a cost of $200,000 while a joint venture agreement for the procurement of converting and packaging
	equipment specific for oral thin film products was proposed through a Letter of Intent. In addition, Altair and Cure agreed to
	enter into further joint ventures or other business relationships for the purpose of completing the development and marketing of
	additional products. and for license and distribution agreements for additional Cure products such as aspirin, sleep-aid, topical
	muscle and joint pain relief, and electrolytes delivered through OTF or other methods. Altair advanced $360,000 to CURE in this
	regard.


	 


	On September 23, 2016, the Company and CURE agreed to terminate
	the Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for CURE’s Sildenafil Products due to the unanticipated costs of obtaining
	regulatory approvals for the introduction of these pharmaceutical products into the licensed markets and to replace it with an
	Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement for a family of sports related nutraceutical products including a topical active for
	joint and muscle pain and OTF products for delivery of electrolyte, energy, sleep and recovery actives, The Company will become
	the exclusive worldwide distributor for these products. The fee for this new Exclusive License and Distribution Agreement was $560,000,
	comprised of the $200,000 fee paid for the Sildenafil agreement and the $360,000 advanced as a deposit for future license and distribution
	agreements.




	The Company had previously planned to commence
	operations in the architectural field and to be responsible for the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings
	as well as municipal organized public areas. This plan was abandoned in the 2015 fiscal year in favor of the business operations
	described above.

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	We have incurred recurring losses to date.
	Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include
	adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
	should we be unable to continue in operation.


	 


	We expect we will require additional capital
	to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity
	or debt securities.

	deficit of $476,238.   


	 




	Cash flow from/used in Operating Activities






	 


	We have not generated positive
	cash flows from operating activities. During the nine month period ended December 31, 2016, the Company used $50,226 of cash for
	operating activities. For the nine month period ended December 31, 2015, the Company used $65,289 of cash for operating activities.


	 




	Cash flow from Financing Activities




	 


	We have financed our operations
	primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. During the nine month period ended December
	31, 2016, the Company received $74,853 of cash from financing activities. For the nine month period ended December 31, 2015 the
	Company received $165,130 of cash from financing activities.

	Going Concern






	 




	We have not attained profitable
	operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our
	auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue
	as a going concern without further financing. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue
	as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the
	ordinary course of business.


	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 


	We have no significant
	off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
	changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
	that are material to stockholders.


	 




	Future Financings




	 


	We will continue to rely
	on equity sales of our common shares or debt financing arrangements in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances
	of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional
	sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.




	 












	Critical Accounting Policies




	 


	Our financial statements
	and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on
	a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
	management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	periods.


	 


	We regularly evaluate the
	accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included
	in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information
	from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances.
	Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.


	 




	Contractual Obligations






	 




	We are a smaller reporting
	company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this
	item.




	 






	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	 


	The Company has implemented
	all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements
	unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been
	issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.

	Controls and Procedures










	 






	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 


	Disclosure controls and
	procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
	filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in
	the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
	to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
	to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required
	disclosure.


	 


	An evaluation was conducted
	under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures, as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure
	controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
	reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
	by the SEC’s rules and forms.


	 




	Management’s Report on Internal
	Control Over Financial Reporting






	 




	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Our
	management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. Our management
	has concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.




	 






	Changes in Internal Control and Financial
	Reporting




	 


	There has been no change
	in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, that occurred during our third fiscal quarter that has
	materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  


	 


	This quarterly report does
	not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
	reporting.  Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm
	pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management’s report in this quarterly report.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no 
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The 
offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of 
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the 
full $60,000 as anticipated.

Gross proceeds                 $30,000   $45,000   $60,000
Offering expenses            $   7,000 $   7,000 $   7,000
Net proceeds                 $  23,000 $  38,000 $  53,000
Establishing an office       $   1,000 $   1,500 $   2,000
Website development          $   1,500 $   2,000 $   4,000
PCs and Software Purchase    $   9,200 $   9,700 $  10,700
Specialist’s salary                  -    12,000    12,000
Marketing and advertising    $   1,000 $   2,000 $  11,000
SEC reporting and compliance $  10,000 $  10,000 $  10,000
Miscellaneous expenses       $     300 $     800 $   3,300

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Homero Giovanni 
Penaherrera Zavala, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the 
Company funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be 
necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement
our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC 
Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for 
trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. However, Mr. Penaherrera Zavala 
has no obligation to loan such funds to us and that there is no guarantee that 
he will loan such funds to us. Mr. Penaherrera Zavala will not be paid any 
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due 
date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Penaherrera Zavala. 
Mr. Penaherrera Zavala will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when 
we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Winning customers will be critical to our ability to grow our business. We are a
new and un-established company, have a weak competitive position in the industry
and have not yet earned any revenues.  We have an operational loss of $6,649
from December 20, 2012 (date of inception) to June 30, 2013. We need capital to
carry out our current business plan.  We also anticipate that we will require
additional financing in order to execute our business plan. We may not have
sufficient financing to sustain our current operations.  Many of the companies
with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those
available to us.  It is uncertain whether services offered by us will achieve
and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance.

The market competition of city of Quito can be evaluated as a high. There are
several large well-established architectural companies which provide similar
service for large scale projects. That is why we plan to concentrate in small
and middle-scale sized projects. Our competitors include all architectural and
interior design companies offering service in both commercial and residential
design throughout Ecuador/South America. In order to be more or less successful
in the existing stiff condition we will provide a new vision of modern single
family houses which are characterized by using brand-new materials, environment
friendly technologies and out of the ordinary appearance. Also we plan to create
some typed projects  with standard type of plan layouts and number of spaces and
which can be constructed in different areas with different surroundings and
which can cost much less. Finally we will make competitive price for our work in
order to get more clients.

Altair International Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market
penetration to date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many
participants in the business of providing architectural services. Many
established, yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of
providing such services.  Nearly all Altair International Corp.'s competitors
have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and
managerial capabilities than us. We are, consequently, at a competitive
disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a successful
company in the interior design and architectural visualization industry.
Therefore, Altair International Corp. may not be able to establish itself within
the industry at all.


Company Description
Altair International Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December
20, 2012 and established a fiscal year end of March 31. We do not have revenues,
have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a
development-stage company formed to commence operations in the field


 of concept
architectural, interior design projects and related areas in Ecuador. We have
recently started our operation.

---

We plan to commence operations in architectural field and to be responsible for
the concept architectural vision of future private and public buildings as well
as municipal organized public areas. Also, we intend to provide interior design
and architectural visualization, 3D rendering and architectural animation
services and plan on using advanced computer technology to produce photo
realistic 3D rendering, walk-through animation and 360 degree panorama. In the
next 12 months after completion of our offering we intend to offer our services
to clients in Ecuador. Working from sketches to fully detailed plans, we plan to
create high detail, high quality three-dimensional renderings. Our images and
animations can be used for design and planning, development, property sales,
buildings, and the effective communication of concepts to clientele. Mr.
Penaherrera Zavala will perform our design services. We anticipate that our
potential clients or client agencies will execute contracts with us regarding
our services in architectural field. We are going to work with wide range of
clients from usual family which wants to upgrade or renovate their home to city
municipalities with appropriate project scale demand. After full payment, our
clients will own the copyrights for our renderings and designs.  

The company’s revenues will be what we charge our clients for our services.
Price of design project will depend on a project scale and will be calculated
individually. We expect to find clients mostly for residential projects.
However, we anticipate occasionally being involved in bigger commercial
projects. For smaller and simpler projects the price will be approximately 10 %
of total building costs. For bigger and more complicated we plan to charge
$30-40 per square meter. This price range depends on:

- Size of the building (unit)

- Color combinations

- Material and finishes required

- Number of views

- Complexity of rendering

Thus, the fully detailed blue prints documentation of all areas, details and
decorative elements of a single family house with a size of 250 square meters
will cost $7,500-$10,000. We plan to create a unique design for every new
project and also offer alternative choices of the design view. Then, after
finishing concept of project we will develop the architectural sketches and
further the blue-print documentation which are going to include fully developed
layouts, crossings and detailed information about every space of designed area.
For every project we will create 3d-models of the design object in all steps
from the concept to the fully detailed plans. Modeling, rendering and final
visual presentation will be included in our service. In addition, we plan
provide consulting regarding materials, furniture choice and supply to our
clients during full period of construction. We also intend to manage the working
relationship and communication between our clients and builders. We will provide
our clients with complete drawings packages in either electronic or hard copy
formats.

We intend to provide several basic types of work:

Interior design projects

We plan to offer complex projects of interior design of most important living
spaces inside the building. By our philosophy, it is very important to suggest
our clients the professional vision of living areas where they will spend their
daily live. That project usually includes blue-prints, detailed sketches,
3d-visualisation, rendering, finish material and furniture choose and
construction process supervising.

Architectural projects

We intend to provide architectural design services like building and structural
design, architectural drafting, architectural drawing, architectural lighting,
plans, cost estimation, layering, 3D modeling and architectural renderings that
will show case single buildings, sites or structures, exterior or interior,
color and texture of proposed materials, and the relationship with the
surrounding buildings and landscape. Architectural renderings are convincing
marketing tools to visualize and demonstrate certain aspects of a future
building or apartment to its buyers. We intend to concentrate on concept
architectural projects of new private and renovate building projects with
further sketches and blue-prints documentation development. Also we plan to be
involved in projects of public buildings and areas.

Landscape architectural projects

As well as working with private clients we also plan to work with more
complicated landscape architectural projects. Landscape architecture is the
design of outdoor public areas, organized green spaces in the cities, landmarks,
and structures to achieve environmental, social-behavioral, or aesthetic
outcomes.

3d modeling

Hand-drawings and written explanations of the architectural and design ideas are
not enough for fully detailed projects. Therefore, in all steps of our projects
we will provide fully detailed 3D-renderings and 3D virtual reality
architectural animations (also known as walk-through or fly-through animations),
a short architectural movies created on a computer. With 3D walk-through any
specific viewpoint can be viewed from any angle or height giving a real
photorealistic feeling. Some of the advantages of virtual 3D walk-through are:  

 - Actual structure, architecture and building materials can be shown;

 - It brings a possibility to explore and experiment with colors, textures, and
   other architectural details;

 - External/Internal lighting such as natural lighting, based upon window
   direction, time of year and time of day can be previewed;

 - 3D Architectural animation will include exterior features such
   as landscaping, trees, hedges, fences;

 - Multiple design options can be explored and resolved before building begins.
