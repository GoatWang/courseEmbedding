"We strive to connect travelers in a meaningful way to genuine experiences. CATC's strong team, amazing experiences and exceptional guest service will only further our ability to create unforgettable adventures in one of the most unique places in the world."

EXPERIENCE VIAD





A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO
As the President and CEO of Viad Corp, I have the privilege of leading two vital and dynamic businesses that are executing on exciting growth strategies. While the businesses offer starkly different services, they do share a common theme of providing unforgettable experiences to the clients and guests we serve. Enhancing the customer experience is at the core of all our services and our teams are striving daily to build lasting relationships based on trust and shared goals. This commitment has led to consistently high client retention at GES and high TripAdvisor ratings within Pursuit, as well as various awards and recognition for both business groups. 
In early 2014, we laid out compelling strategies for both business groups to strengthen the underlying business and drive significant shareholder returns. I am proud to state that we are executing extremely well on our goals and objectives, which have helped to bolster GES’ competitive position and provide scale to our high-margin Pursuit business.

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO
As the President and CEO of Viad Corp, I have the privilege of leading two vital and dynamic businesses that are executing on exciting growth strategies. While the businesses offer starkly different services, they do share a common theme of providing unforgettable experiences to the clients and guests we serve. Enhancing the customer experience is at the core of all our services and our teams are striving daily to build lasting relationships based on trust and shared goals. This commitment has led to consistently high client retention at GES and high TripAdvisor ratings within Pursuit, as well as various awards and recognition for both business groups. 
In early 2014, we laid out compelling strategies for both business groups to strengthen the underlying business and drive significant shareholder returns. I am proud to state that we are executing extremely well on our goals and objectives, which have helped to bolster GES’ competitive position and provide scale to our high-margin Pursuit business.
At GES, our goal is to broaden our suite of live event services toward higher margin and higher growth adjacencies. Over the past few years, we have expanded our Event Technology and Audio Visual offerings through a combination of organic initiatives and strategic acquisitions, which has resulted in accelerated top-line growth and improved profitability. In addition, these acquisitions provide us a solid platform to cross-sell into our existing client base and improve our overall value proposition. As we position GES as the preferred global, full-service provider for live events, we will continue to evolve with the needs and wants of our customers to deliver epic events that engage and delight. 
At Pursuit, our goal is to add meaningful scale to the business through our “Refresh, Build, Buy” initiatives, while maintaining or improving our strong EBITDA margins. Since 2010, we have added eight lodging assets and three attractions to our portfolio of offerings. During the same time frame, we have embarked upon major “Refresh” projects at both our lodging assets and attractions, which have resulted in an improved guest experience and enhanced profitability of the portfolio as a whole. In addition, we have strengthened revenue management efforts and systems to maximize yield across our portfolio of high-quality assets. 
Overall, we have a clear strategy for both of Viad’s leading business groups, and a strong balance sheet and cash flows that allow us the flexibility to invest in these strategies. I am very proud of the progress we are making and looking ahead, we anticipate these strategic initiatives to enhance shareholder value and be the key drivers of our growth and profitability. Over the long-term, we expect to grow GES’ non-Exhibition services to represent approximately 50% of GES revenues and we expect to scale Pursuit to ≥$250 million in annualized revenues. None of this would be possible without the team of passionate, talented people who are dedicated to delivering memorable experiences for our customers every day.
Thank you for your interest in Viad. 


SteVen W. Moster

                President & Chief Executive Officer, Viad Corp

Visit GES.com
GES, a global full-service provider for live events, partners with show organizers, exhibitors and brand marketers to create high-value, face-to-face events. We offer a complete range of services, from the design and production of compelling, immersive experiences that engage audiences and build brand awareness, to material handling, rigging, electrical and other on-site services. In addition, GES offers clients a full suite of audio-visual services from creative and technology to content and design along with online tools powered by next generation technologies that help them easily manage the complexities of their events.

Conferences

Consumer Events



The Markets we Serve
The Live Events industry is a large market and GES serves all major segments with a dominant position in Exhibitions. We are pursuing a focused and disciplined growth strategy, with the goal of expanding our share in the currently under-penetrated Corporate Event and Conference segments. These segments offer strong growth opportunity with a higher margin profile than Exhibitions, which will help to improve profitability and diversify our revenue mix over the long-term.





Exhibitions
The primary purpose is to facilitate B2B & B2C sales/marketing.  Host and exhibitors typically pay for services.










Conferences
The primary purpose is to facilitate attendee education; expo or trade show may be held in conjunction to further facilitate attendee education. Host and exhibitors typically pay for services.














Corporate Events
The primary purpose is to facilitate attendee education of sponsoring company’s products or product ecosystem. Corporation or host pays for services.









Consumer Events
The primary purpose is to entertain, educate or create an experience, typically around a specific genre.






















GES offers a comprehensive and award-winning range of services and innovative technology, including creative design, strategy, audio visual, show production and event accommodations to help our clients maximize performance and achieve their visions through face-to-face experiences. In connection with our focused growth strategy, we have made important acquisitions of leading Audio-Visual (AV) production and Event Technology firms. These new services are a perfect complement to our Core Services. They also have higher-margins and provide a more compelling offering to penetrate Corporate Events and Conferences where AV is larger portion of the total spend.
