DexMat - High Performance Carbon Nanotubes products






















































 
 








DexMat manufactures high performance products made from Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) for a new generation of consumer and commercial applications.

DexMat’s competitive advantage is our proprietary solution-processing technology of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), originally developed at Rice University by our founders. Our technology delivers fibers and films that are made of essentially pure CNTs, without the use of binders and additives. Our process is scalable to large volume manufacturing and cost effective.
DexMat’s CNT fibers and films conduct electricity like metals; yet have the flexibility, lightweight and corrosion resistance qualities of polymers—the best of both worlds.


PreviousNext12

Brief History of DexMat
The fundamental technology used by DexMat was developed over the last ten years by a multitude of researchers in Prof. Pasquali’s lab at Rice University. Professor Pasquali’s vision to build a 100% CNT-based macro-object from an infinite number of nano-sized CNT molecules using a process that could be scaled to large volume manufacturing, culminated with the highly cited research paper published in Science, 11 Jan 2013 pp. 182-186.
Late in 2014, DexMat’s founders met in Houston to discuss forming a private company to capitalize on the technology. The deal was sealed over a few glasses of Barolo and Amarone.
The company was incorporated in early February 2015.

The laboratory targets applications in energy transmission and harvesting, biomedicine, petroleum, aerospace and defense.  
From 2006 to 2008, Prof. Pasquali co-directed the Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory (CNL) following the death of CNL’s founder Prof. Rick Smalley (1996 Nobel) and led the transition of the laboratory into a shared facility within the Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology. Prof. Pasquali holds 6 issued US patents and has authored over 130 scientific articles, which have been cited over 4300 times.  For more information, see the website of Prof. Pasquali’s research group at pasquali.rice.edu and Prof. Pasquali’s profile on ResearcherID and Google Scholar.
DexMatDmitri TsentalovichFounderEducation: Ph.D. Chemical Engineering, Rice University, 2015; B.S. Chemical Engineering, University of New Hampshire, 2008.
Dr. Tsentalovich is an expert in the fields of carbon nanotubes and fluid-phase-processing, specializing in the production and commercialization of multifunctional carbon nanotube based materials. His research in the Pasquali group was focused on studying the fluid properties of CNT solutions in chlorosulfonic acid in order to improve the strength and conductivity of acid-spun CNT fibers.  His graduate work includes publications that describe a method for measuring the length of CNTs with extensional rheology, phase behavior of CNT and graphene solutions, and spinning and post-processing CNT fibers. 
Dr. Tsentalovich has presented his research on carbon nanotube rheology in conferences such as the Society of Rheology 2010 and the International Congress on Rheology 2012. He presented his research on carbon nanotube fibers at the American Society of Mechanical Engineering Congress 2013. Dr. Tsentalovich helped DexMat win $67,000 in the 2015 Rice Business Plan Competition and has more than one year of business management experience as a cofounder of Nanolinea, a startup based on the commercial development of carbon nanotube fibers for treating cardiac arrhythmias.
DexMatFrancesca MirriCo-OwnerFrancesca Mirri is a co-owner of DexMat and a 5th year PhD candidate in the research group of Prof. Matteo Pasquali in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department at Rice University. She graduated with a BS in Chemical Engineering from the University of Bologna (2009).  
Her research has focused on the production and characterization of conductive films and coatings from solutions of carbon nanotubes in chlorosulfonic acid. In particular, Francesca has developed a process to coat CNT acid solutions over the insulation layer of coaxial cables, as a means to create an effective and extra-lightweight EM shield for coaxial cables—potentially eliminating the use of heavy metal braids in coaxial cables. In addition, Francesca has extensive experience coating thin films of CNT solutions to produce electrically conductive transparent films.
Francesca’s scientific experience includes work on the synthesis of carbon nanotubes using a CVD process on a substrate pre-seeded with catalyst.
Her work has been published in scientific journals and presented in conferences such as the International Society of Coating Science & Technology (ISCST) symposium in 2014 and Chemontubes in 2012.

Carbon Nanotube Manufacturers and Suppliers
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) come in a variety of diameters, lengths, and functional group content. CNTs today are available for industrial applications in bulk quantities of metric ton quantities. Several CNT manufacturers have >100 ton per year production capacity for multi walled nanotubes.
A nanotube may consist of one tube of graphite, a one-atom thick single-wall nanotube, or a number of concentric tubes called multiwalled nanotubes. When viewed with a transmission electron microscope these tubes appear as planes. Whereas single walled nanotubes appear as two planes, in multi walled nanotubes more than two planes are observed, and can be seen as a series of parallel lines. There are different types of CNTs, because the graphitic sheets can be rolled in different ways. The three types of CNTs are Zigzag, Armchair, and Chiral. It is possible to recognize zigzag, armchair, and chiral CNTs just by following the pattern across the diameter of the tubes, and analyzing their cross-sectional structure.
Multi walled nanotubes can come in an even more complex array of forms, because each concentric single-walled nanotube can have different structures, and hence there are a variety of sequential arrangements. The simplest sequence is when concentric layers are identical but different in diameter. However, mixed variants are possible, consisting of two or more types of concentric CNTs arranged in different orders. These can have either regular layering or random layering. The structure of the nanotube influences its properties - including electrical and thermal conductivity, density, and lattice structure. Both type and diameter are important. The wider the diameter of the nanotube, the more it behaves like graphite. The narrower the diameter of the nanotube, the more its intrinsic properties depends upon its specific type.

Thermoplastics

Carbon NanoStructure (CNS) Chopped Fiber begins as a single-end glass roving product, such as E-CR glass, that is enhanced using a proprietary ANS process. Unique multiwall carbon nanotube-based CNS are added to the glass surface, endowing the product with multifunctional properties. This CNS-infused chopped glass product is designed for use as a reinforcement for thermoset and thermoplastic resins that not only yields enhanced mechanical properties, but also makes the material conductive.
CNS Encapsulated Flakes are a unique form of carbon nanotubes, produced using a proprietary ANS process. The ANS process creates cross-linked multiwall carbon nanotube-based networks of CNS with a distinctive morphology that, when added to polymers, elastomers and thermoplastics, enhance the resulting products with multifunctional properties, such as increased conductivity and dramatically improved strength and modulus. These properties allow for the replacement of metal parts with CNS-infused thermoplastics containing a very small amount of CNS, which result in significant cost savings.
