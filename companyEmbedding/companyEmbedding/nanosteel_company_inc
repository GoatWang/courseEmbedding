Automakers are investing in new materials that will reduce weight to meet the challenge of higher fuel economy standards without compromising safety and ride quality. To meet these goals, a new generation of Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for lightweighting vehicles is required for integration into vehicle structural designs and production. NanoSteel’s AHSS enables the auto industry to continue to utilize steel’s existing infrastructure, scale and efficiencies versus switching to other lightweighting materials which may have higher costs, longer cycle times and limited availability.A New Automotive SteelNanoSteel is poised to meet the automotive industry’s performance target with AHSS designs that deliver both high strength and high ductility in cold formable steel. These unique performance capabilities will allow the use of thinner steel gauges and more complex geometry parts to maintain stiffness in the pursuit of lighter vehicles with better fuel economy.

Material Matters
Vehicle LightweightingThe first applications of NanoSteel's AHSS sheet designs will be to form structural parts in body-in-white (BIW) vehicle systems. The body-in-white (BIW) typically represents more than 20% of vehicle weight and stands to benefit more than any other automotive system from the weight reducing capabilities of NanoSteel’s new AHSS.
