Jim Richardson is the senior partner of the firm, and heads the firm's personal injury practice. Jim represents plaintiffs in a broad range of personal injury matters, including automobile accidents, truck accidents, industrial accidents, insurance law, premises liability, wrongful death and catastrophic injuries, products liability, and nursing home abuse and neglect. Mr. Richardson has the unique advantage of having some twenty (20) years of experience as a defense attorney to draw on, having handled insurance claims, product liability cases, transportation accidents, work injuries, and liability claims of all types. Because Mr. Richardson knows the games the claims adjusters and defense attorneys will play, he can anticipate their strategies and keep his clients a step ahead.

District Courts for the Northern, Middle and Southern Districts of Alabama, the U. S. Claims Court, the U. S. Courts of Appeals for the Fifth, Eleventh and Federal Circuits, and the U. S.

He holds memberships in the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association, the Defense Research Institute, and the Alabama Defense Lawyers Association. An Alabama native, Mr. Richardson received his undergraduate education at Davidson College (B.A. 1975) and his law degree from the University of Alabama School of Law (J.D. 1978), where he was a Hugo Black Scholar, a member of the Order of the Coif, a member of the Board of Editors of the Journal of the Legal Profession (1976-1978) and author of "Unconscionable Litigation and the Attorney," 3 Journal of the Legal Profession 153 (1978). Following graduation from law school, he served as a Law Clerk to the Honorable J. Foy Guin, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama (1978-79). Mr. Richardson's reported cases include: Glenn v. General Motors Corp., 658 F. Supp. 918 (N.D. Ala. 1986), 841 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied 488 U.S. 948 (1988); Johnson v.

introduction




                Jim Richardson is senior partner at Richardson Maples, PC, and heads the firm’s personal injury practice. He represents plaintiffs in a broad range of personal injury matters, including auto accidents, truck accidents, motorcycle accidents, insurance bad faith, premises liability, products liability, wrongful death, medical malpractice, nursing home abuse and work injuries.

Among personal injury lawyers, Mr. Richardson has the unique advantage of having some 20 years experience as a defense attorney, handling all types of insurance and liability claims. He knows the tactics used by claims adjusters and insurance defense attorneys, and can anticipate their strategies to keep his clients a step ahead.

An Alabama native, Mr. Richardson received his undergraduate education at Davidson College (Bachelor of Arts, 1975) and his law degree from the University of Alabama School of Law (Juris Doctor, 1978), where he was a Hugo Black Scholar, a member of the Order of the Coif, a member of the Board of Editors of the Journal of the Legal Profession, and author of “Unconscionable Litigation and the Attorney,” 3 Journal of Legal Profession 153 (1978). Following graduation from law school, he served as a Law Clerk to the Honorable J. Foy Guin, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama.

introduction




                Jim Richardson is senior partner at Richardson Maples, PC, and heads the firm’s personal injury practice. He represents plaintiffs in a broad range of personal injury matters, including auto accidents, truck accidents, motorcycle accidents, insurance bad faith, premises liability, products liability, wrongful death, medical malpractice, nursing home abuse and work injuries.

Among personal injury lawyers, Mr. Richardson has the unique advantage of having some 20 years experience as a defense attorney, handling all types of insurance and liability claims. He knows the tactics used by claims adjusters and insurance defense attorneys, and can anticipate their strategies to keep his clients a step ahead.

An Alabama native, Mr. Richardson received his undergraduate education at Davidson College (Bachelor of Arts, 1975) and his law degree from the University of Alabama School of Law (Juris Doctor, 1978), where he was a Hugo Black Scholar, a member of the Order of the Coif, a member of the Board of Editors of the Journal of the Legal Profession, and author of “Unconscionable Litigation and the Attorney,” 3 Journal of Legal Profession 153 (1978). Following graduation from law school, he served as a Law Clerk to the Honorable J. Foy Guin, Jr., United States District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama.
