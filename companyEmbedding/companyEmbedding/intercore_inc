Driver Alertness Detection System 
 


What is the DADS System?The Driver Alertness Detection System (DADS) monitors a driver's state of alertness in real-time to reduce the risk of road accidents caused by drowsiness and fatigue.  This new technology allows increased driver performance and safety by analysing biometric data and sending notifications directly to the vehicle operator.

Impact of drowsy driving in the United States.
 
The Driver Alertness Detection System (DADS) identifies and alerts drivers of microsleeps which provide invaluable early-stage alerts well in advance of dangerous fatigue levels.
In development for more than 10 years, this technology is best in class, and has broad applications for trucking, commercial transportation, as well as individual users.
WHY  DADS?
Driving in a state of excessive fatigue or drowsiness has been identified to be a key factor in one out of five accidents involving death or injury.  The National Sleep Foundation has reported that 37% of American drivers have fallen asleep at the wheel in 2013.  In Europe and Australia, drowsy driving represents 10 to 30% of all car crashes.
Our proprietary eye behaviour monitoring algorithms are the backbone of our system.  They effectively monitor fatigue levels and, with real-time intervention, allow users to take action that can prevent accidents.

InterCore, Inc. is a publicly traded (IROC:OTC) company and a leader in the development of real-time safety systems and tracking products.

InterCore Reduces Costs, Continues to Advance DADS Development
InterCore announced that development of its core DADS (Driver Alertness Detection System) product has continued to advance, despite non-product challenges faced during 2015.  Boynton Beach, FL,  January 12, 2016 --(PR.com)-- InterCore, Inc. (OTCQB: ICOR) today announced that development of its core DADS™ (Driver Alertness Detection System™) product has continued to advance, despite non-product challenges faced during 2015.“At least two significant non-product challenges faced the Company during last year and slowed our progress. While these were being addressed, we used the time to re-examine our strategy and develop what we believe is the best plan for advancing the DADS product offerings,” said James F. Groelinger, InterCore’s President and CEO. He continued: “We reduced our staff by more than 80% and made commensurate reductions in operating expenses. The overall result is that our overhead has been reduced by more than $5 million annually. With these efficiencies in place, we are continuing with our DADS product development and I’m satisfied with the operating correction.”ICOR management also noted that it would provide further guidance on anticipated DADS’s product development, potential sales, and corporate mission in the coming weeks.About InterCore, Inc.InterCore, Inc. (OTCQB: ICOR) is a public company focused on the commercialization of its Driver Alertness Detection System™ (DADS™); designed to alert trucking operators of the onset of fatigue. Ultimately, DADS is intended to save lives and property while providing comfort and reliability to its users and operators. See www.intercoreinc.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release contains certain "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and many of which are beyond the Company's control. The forward-looking statements are also identified through the use of words "believe," "enable," "may," "will," "could," "intends," "estimate," "anticipate," "plan," "predict," "probable," "potential," "possible," "should," "continue," and other words of similar meaning. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risk factors detailed in the Company's periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission via the Edgar system. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and no assurances can be given that such statements will be achieved.Contact:James F.

Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and many of which are beyond the Company's control. The forward-looking statements are also identified through the use of words "believe," "enable," "may," "will," "could," "intends," "estimate," "anticipate," "plan," "predict," "probable," "potential," "possible," "should," "continue," and other words of similar meaning. Actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risk factors detailed in the Company's periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission via the Edgar system. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements and no assurances can be given that such statements will be achieved.CONTACT:Karyn Byrne investors@intercoreinc.com T 416-722-1244SOURCE: InterCore, Inc.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAnthony Scaramucci's wife reportedly filed for divorce because he was 'hell-bent' on joining TrumpBusiness InsiderThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekWells Fargo faces angry questions after new sales abuses uncoveredReutersThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceTrunk Club.
