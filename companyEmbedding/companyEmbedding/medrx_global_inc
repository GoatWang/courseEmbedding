The Calibration should be checked annually to determine that the   audiometer is within the tolerances permitted by American Standard Specification   for Audiometers, S3.6-2004


Requirements for the periodic verification of the
performance of an   audiometer are specified in IEC 60645-1 & ISO 8253-1


An important part of the process is the calibration of the earphones and bone   conductors. MedRx offers calibration service for our products to best   accommodate our customers.


We offer competitive pricing and quick turn-around. Our calibration complies   with the ANSI specifications S3.6-2004.


The calibration data for your device is saved on a CD and copied to our   server for traceability. Along with the CD-ROM, you will receive a Certificate   of Calibration for each audiometric transducer and a detailed Report. 


Fees: $250 includes all taxes, packing and return shipping
        Your   calibration will be returned by UPS Standard Overnight. (Where Overnight Service   is available)

 
We highly recommend using UPS or FedEx when sending your   calibration in so we can track your package.

Call to get an RA number before sending your equipment in.

      Vice President, MedRx, Inc.



Estimates from several independent studies indicate that up to 6 per 1,000 newborns have some level of hearing loss and there is growing evidence that latent losses go undetected in a large percentage of pediatrics patients under the age of 3 years old.  Testing for newborns has been established through otoacoustic emissions testing to identify early loss, however, some congenital losses may not become evident until later in childhood. Fitting these children and programming with hearing instruments can be, at best, challenging.  The good news is that there are protocols and hardware from MedRx that can address this challenge.
 
The need  to achieve greater fitting accuracy and selecting appropriate amplification has led to the development of RECD (REAL-EAR to Couple Difference) measurements. RECD measurements have gained popularity in many practices, allowing hearing aids to be pre-programmed prior to fitting.  Remember, infants and children have much smaller ear canal volumes which introduces sizable variation in the amplification process
 
THE RECD
The RECD is simply the difference in dB across frequency, between the SPL measured in a 2-cc coupler (available from MedRx) and the SPL measured in the patient’s ear. This difference measure is also used in some amplification fitting protocols (e.g., DSL [i/o], NAL-NL1) to capture the effects of the patient’s occluded ear canal acoustics. Obtaining the patient’s individual measurement is helpful in converting HL to ear canal SPL to accurately select an appropriate hearing instrument. It can also be used in calculating the predicted REAR (Real-Ear Aided Response) which is used when verifying hearing aids in a coupler.

The Hearing Loss Simulator (HLS) demonstrates the effect of the client’s   hearing loss for the spouse or family member. The program attenuates an input   signal to simulate the severity of the loss for the third party. The spouse or   family member listens to the free field speakers with and then without the   simulated hearing loss. The practitioner can toggle between “normal” and   “hearing impaired” simulations for a powerful and dramatic demonstration to the   third party. The third party member can also hear how their own voice is   distorted by the hearing loss when the “Record Input” option is used. This   provides a real-world experience for the third party. This reinforcement is   effective in encouraging the patient to purchase hearing instruments. The   Hearing Loss Simulator requires the client’s Audiogram data. 
 
In addition, MedRx offers a Hearing Aid Simulator (HAS) as an alternative to   using a stock hearing aid to demonstrate the benefits of amplification to an   inexperienced user. The system applies the fitting rules by default to the   patient’s audiogram and simulates how a hearing aid can help. The patient is   instructed to listen to this signal through the headphones. Options for editing   the gain applied to the audiogram are provided in the software.
 
Using these tools, can empower the patient and the third party to make   informed and logical decisions about their healthcare.

Patient-centered hearing care is a family event. It involves both patient and   third parties in the decision making process of hearing aid selection. The IOM   (Institute of Medicine) defines patient-centered care as: “Providing care that   is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and   values and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions. ”Clearly   it is in the best interest of the patient’s outcome to be actively involved in   the fitting process, as well as their children, spouses and friends.
 
Patients want guidance from their hearing care providers, but they expect   that guidance to be provided in the context of full, unbiased information about   options, benefits and risks. This is where a third party can have the most   positive impact, “Patient-centered” means considering patients’ cultural   traditions, personal preferences and values, family situations, social   circumstances, physical limitations and lifestyles.
 
In addition to performing a clinical analysis of the scope and breadth of a   patient’s hearing loss through the normal test protocols of Audiometry,   Tympanometry and otoscopic evaluation, it is critically important to secure   third party involvement in the understanding of the hearing loss. Consensus is   necessary in achieving commitment from the patient to accept amplification as   treatment.
 
Today, there are advanced computer-based technologies that incorporate   “on-board” tools that are designed specifically for the third party.   Gaining commitment from the patient for hearing instruments is the primary goal   during the initial stages of examination and diagnosis. MedRx recognizes that   these tools allow their advanced diagnostic technologies (audiometry, REAL EAR)   to bridge the gap between analysis and amplification acquisition.
