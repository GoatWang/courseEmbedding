History[edit]
The company was founded by Jessica Richman and Zachary Apte who were scientists in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences.[1] In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.[2] The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz.[3][4] As of 2015, uBiome had raised a total of more than $6 million but had failed to achieve profitability, and had not set a goal for when the company would turn a profit.[5]
In 2015 uBiome offered a grant program under which is would give grantees $100,000 worth of kits and provide the data, which it also had the right to keep and include in its database.[6] One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had been interested in understanding the human microbiome better and also had an interest in hospital acquired infections; it applied and won such a grant to study microbiomes of people before, during, and after they left a hospital.[6]
As part of their citizen science business model, the company has put out many calls for people with certain kinds of concerns or conditions to send them samples; they launched one related to weight in conjunction with their launch of an Apple app in 2015.[7][8]
Products and services[edit]
Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set.[5][9] In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California.[6]
Technology[edit]
As of 2015[update], the company first amplifies RNA using PCR then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA, which allows bacteria to be categorized at the genus level.[10] The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons.[11][12] A 2014 report in Xconomy said the company outsources the sequencing.[12] The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer.[13][14]
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval.[16][17][18] The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues.[16][19]
The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013.[16][20][21]
In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication.[16][22]
UBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andme, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley and each of which sparked widespread interest and controversy.[6][23]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Jessica Richman and Zachary Apte who were scientists in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences.[1] In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.[2] The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz.[3][4] As of 2015, uBiome had raised a total of more than $6 million but had failed to achieve profitability, and had not set a goal for when the company would turn a profit.[5]
In 2015 uBiome offered a grant program under which is would give grantees $100,000 worth of kits and provide the data, which it also had the right to keep and include in its database.[6] One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had been interested in understanding the human microbiome better and also had an interest in hospital acquired infections; it applied and won such a grant to study microbiomes of people before, during, and after they left a hospital.[6]
As part of their citizen science business model, the company has put out many calls for people with certain kinds of concerns or conditions to send them samples; they launched one related to weight in conjunction with their launch of an Apple app in 2015.[7][8]
Products and services[edit]
Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set.[5][9] In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California.[6]
Technology[edit]
As of 2015[update], the company first amplifies RNA using PCR then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA, which allows bacteria to be categorized at the genus level.[10] The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons.[11][12] A 2014 report in Xconomy said the company outsources the sequencing.[12] The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer.[13][14]
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval.[16][17][18] The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues.[16][19]
The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013.[16][20][21]
In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication.[16][22]
UBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andme, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley and each of which sparked widespread interest and controversy.[6][23]

The company was founded by Jessica Richman and Zachary Apte who were scientists in the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences.[1] In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.[2] The founders received mentoring and funding from Y Combinator and further funding from Andreessen Horowitz.[3][4] As of 2015, uBiome had raised a total of more than $6 million but had failed to achieve profitability, and had not set a goal for when the company would turn a profit.[5]
In 2015 uBiome offered a grant program under which is would give grantees $100,000 worth of kits and provide the data, which it also had the right to keep and include in its database.[6] One winner of the first round of such grants was the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had been interested in understanding the human microbiome better and also had an interest in hospital acquired infections; it applied and won such a grant to study microbiomes of people before, during, and after they left a hospital.[6]
As part of their citizen science business model, the company has put out many calls for people with certain kinds of concerns or conditions to send them samples; they launched one related to weight in conjunction with their launch of an Apple app in 2015.[7][8]
Products and services[edit]
Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set.[5][9] In 2015 uBiome received Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification from the State of California.[6]
Technology[edit]
As of 2015[update], the company first amplifies RNA using PCR then sequences the amplified 16S ribosomal RNA, which allows bacteria to be categorized at the genus level.[10] The company has proprietary machine learning algorithms that analyze the sequence data and compare it with the company's proprietary database of microbiomes, built from the samples that partners and single customers send to them, and web-based software that allows individuals to view their microbiome and make certain comparisons.[11][12] A 2014 report in Xconomy said the company outsources the sequencing.[12] The sequencing is done on the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer.[13][14]
In October 2015 the company introduced an app on iOS using ResearchKit that allowed customers to view their results on mobile devices.[15]
Controversies[edit]
Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by bioethicists about the company's citizen science business model - namely whether it had actually obtained informed consent from its customers, and whether direct to consumer genetic testing initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of Institutional review board (IRB) approval.[16][17][18] The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues.[16][19]
The company obtained IRB approval in July 2013.[16][20][21]
In 2014, people experienced in biotechnology entrepreneurship also raised questions about the ethics of crowdfunding a biotech company, as the risks of such ventures are high even for people with scientific and business sophistication.[16][22]
UBiome has been compared with Theranos and 23andme, each of which are also biotechnology companies influenced by Silicon Valley and each of which sparked widespread interest and controversy.[6][23]

			Probiotics: What Are Probiotic Foods – uBiome
		
























uBiome


EnglishEspañolDeutschItaliano





Probiotics Guide

What are probiotics?

  Your gut plays host to a wide variety of species of bacteria.

There’s quite a lot of it down there too.

Like most humans you probably have between 500 and 1,000 different species in your gastrointestinal tract but for the most part it’s definitely something to be relieved about rather than to lose sleep over.

You see, in today’s fussily-clean world there can sometimes be a popular tendency to believe that bacteria are bad for us.

But although it’s true that a few species can be harmful, particularly in large amounts, the truth is that most bacteria are harmless and in fact quite a few are actually pretty crucial to life.
Right now, for example, your gut probably contains certain types of bacteria that are synthesizing vitamins, and others which are helping you digest some kinds of foods (fiber particularly) that your own body is not equipped to process.

  With a good diet and the absence of ill-health, your microbiome will tend to keep itself well balanced.

 What happens however when conditions aren’t quite so perfect?

Perhaps your diet isn’t ideal, or for one reason or another you find yourself under a lot of stress.

In cases such as these, you can end up with less of the good types of bacteria, and more of the bad, which is when some experts say it can help to consciously “top up” with healthy bacteria, using supplements we call probiotics.

So what are probiotics exactly?
Technically speaking, probiotics are preparations containing live bacteria which are taken orally to restore your body’s beneficial bacteria.

In simpler terms they’re good bacteria you eat, drink, or swallow in order to have a healthier gut - or just to keep it in good order.

The word probiotic means “for life”, and there are two main ways to get probiotics down into your gastrointestinal tract.


1. Eat foods which are naturally rich in healthy bacteria.

2. Swallow specially-prepared capsules that have been manufactured to contain the right sorts of concentrated bacteria.

One important consideration is that probiotics must consist of live microorganisms (in fact, this is how the World Health Organization defines them). Another is that the microbial content of 
  probiotics need to be capable of surviving their lengthy journey through the stomach’s fiercely acidic conditions as well as other perils in order to reach the right place in the intestines.

Your stomach can be a hostile place for tiny, defenseless microbes.

Gastric acid is about as strong as battery acid, so probiotics must either be naturally resilient, or helped to be so via the capsules they’re contained in (in the case of supplements).
  Are your probiotics working?
The benefits of probiotics

 One useful indicator of how well-balanced your gut bacteria are is the regularity of your bowel movements.

In fact for many people a change in this respect is the first sign that taking probiotics might be a good idea, and research shows that probiotics can indeed be good for digestive health.

Diarrhea or constipation may provide an indication that your body’s bacteria need rebalancing with probiotics, and there is also reasonable evidence that they may also help with other disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and possibly even Crohn’s disease.


In addition to improving digestive health, probiotics are also likely to boost your immune system - the mechanism that defends your body from invading microbes.

One of the ways in which probiotics can make this happen is by raising your levels of something called “mucin”, proteins which help form the mucosal lining of your gut.

  What does mucin do?

Well, it plays an important part in developing an environment in which bad bacteria can’t thrive, and also helps to protect your intestines from friction and erosion.

While many people have naturally effective immune systems, immunity is often compromised as you age, or if you find yourself in stressful life situations.

Another way in which probiotics may contribute to better health is in helping to protect the lining of your gut.

Your gastrointestinal tract contains bacteria which, while relatively harmless in your gut, would cause significant health issues were they to escape into your bloodstream.

As we’ve already seen, the inside of your gut should be covered with mucosa, and probiotics can help in the production of this, keeping the bad guys out of your blood.

Furthermore, the epithelial cells lining your colon (epithelial means the tissue which lines the services and cavities of your body’s organs and blood vessels) have something called adherence sites.

Adherence sites are locations where bacteria can attach themselves.

Once healthy bacteria (via probiotics) have occupied these positions, the harmful bacteria are squeezed out, with no place for them to attach themselves.

Finally, another of the benefits of probiotics is that they’re great overall at boosting general well-being and health, even for those who are already in good shape.

A daily dose of probiotics, either as a supplement or in the form of food, is a good way to help you maintain a healthily balanced gut ready to defend itself against disease or stress.

  
Best probiotic yogurt (and other probiotics)
Yogurt is an excellent way to get bacteria into your digestive system as it is produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.

Our ancient ancestors fermented milk in this way starting a very long time ago, so were in some ways early adopters of probiotics.

When the Bible waxed lyrical about “the land of milk and honey” for instance, the “milk” was actually a fermented yogurt.

And Marco Polo wrote about kefir, a fermented milk drink (more details below) in his 13th century travel journals, alluding to what he called their “magical properties”.

By definition all yogurt is produced by bacteria.

But does that mean all yogurt contains bacteria?


Two types of bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (thankfully usually abbreviated to L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus) are used to turn milk into yogurt via fermentation, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they end up in the products you purchase in the store.

You see some manufacturers heat-treat their yogurt after the fermentation process to give it a longer shelf-life.

In the process, however, the bacteria - both good and bad - get killed off.

So the first thing to look for in yogurt is the wording “Live and Active Cultures”.

In addition, it’s best to avoid yogurts which have lots of additives in the form of sugar, flavors, and coloring.
Generally, the shorter the ingredients list, the better the yogurt will be for you.

L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus are both regarded to some degree as having probiotic qualities, although it’s not absolutely clear that they are able to survive the stomach before reaching your gut.

Some commercially available yogurts have other species of probiotic bacteria added to them in addition to L. bulgaricus and S. thermophilus (which are automatically in all live yogurts sold in the U.S. It can’t be called yogurt if it doesn’t contain those two.).

A few to look out for are B. animalis lactis (appears to lower inflammation), B. lactis (may help with Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and L. casei (possible improvements to the gut barrier system).

Overall, for the best probiotic yogurt it’s probably advisable to choose unsweetened, unflavored products, adding your own sweetener (e.g. honey) or flavor (fruit for example).

  Foods with probiotics

Since everybody eats, wouldn’t it be wonderful if the food you consumed also helped to top up your microbiome’s good bacteria?

Wouldn’t it be great if foods with probiotics could form part of your routine daily diet?

Well the good news is, they can.

Before there was refrigeration, foodstuffs could be made to last longer through the process of fermentation.

Think about foods such as sauerkraut and yogurt, made respectively from fermented cabbage, and milk.

Both keep for a long time.

Let’s run through a few of the most widely available foods with probiotics then, and we’ll start with dairy products.
  

As we’ve already seen, certain types of yogurt, as long as they contain live cultures, can be a terrific source of healthy bacteria.
Buttermilk is the liquid left behind when milk is churned to make butter, and it contains probiotics.

Cheese is another good place to find probiotics, especially if it has been aged for a lengthy period. In addition to the naturally occurring bacteria which form as part of the manufacturing process, some cheese makers also deliberately add other probiotics to their products.

Kefir is an ancient type of the dairy foods with probiotics. As we’ve seen, Marco Polo and his crew were drinking it way back in the 13th century, and some say it’s what kept his men alive when others perished. Kefir is a fermented milk drink which tends to contain more bacterial strains than yogurt.
  

In addition to dairy foods, probiotics can also be found in items which have been fermented, but just as with yogurt it’s important to steer clear of products that have been heat-treated as this kills off the bacteria.
  

Look for sauerkraut in the supermarket. Even better, make your own. Same goes for kombucha.
Kimchi is a spicy Korean type of sauerkraut.
Kimchi and sauerkraut are both made from fermented cabbage, and both are good probiotic sources.
Miso, made from fermented grains and beans, is a Japanese seasoning used in cooking. To ensure its probiotic qualities, however, it needs to be added to hot dishes after cooking, as heat kills bacteria whether they are good or bad.

Be conscious once again of heat when it comes to choosing pickles, another fine source of foods with probiotics.
  
Pickles, which are cucumbers fermented in vinegar, usually contain probiotics unless they have been pasteurized (a preserving process using high temperatures).
  
Finally, tempeh is another useful probiotic food. It’s a high-protein product made from fermented whole soy beans, not to be confused with tofu, however.



Look for one or two probiotics-containing foods every time you do your grocery shopping and you won’t go far wrong.
  
  Are there side effects to probiotics?

Although it seems clear that probiotics can offer many benefits, it’s also important of course to know whether or not there are probiotics side effects.

According to the U.S. National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, the safety of probiotics depends largely on your state of health.

In general, probiotics have a good safety record in people who are largely healthy.

If side effects occur at all, they usually only consist of mild digestive symptoms such as gas.

However some reports suggest a link between probiotics and severe side effects in people who have some pre-existing serious medical conditions.

These side effects may include the possibility of infections.
Four types of people are most at risk from the severe side effects of probiotics:

(1) Patients who are critically ill

(2) Patients who have recently had surgery

(3) Infants who are very sick

(4) People with weakened (compromised) immune systems

If you are generally in good health, probiotics should be completely safe to take, but if you have any doubts at all, it’s sensible to seek the advice of your healthcare provider.

And that’s particularly so if you plan to make significant changes to your dietary regime.

Some probiotics have shown promise in research, but strong evidence supporting their use for specific health conditions is lacking.

Probiotic products that are consumed as dietary supplements are manufactured and regulated as foods, rather than as drugs.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far not approved any probiotics for treating or preventing any health problem.

What’s more, some experts warn that the rapid growth in probiotics use (and their marketing) may be outpacing scientific research for many of their proposed benefits and uses.

Using advanced DNA sequencing building on research from the NIH Human Microbiome Project, we've perfected the technology to perform large-scale microbiome studies.
Researchers and citizen scientists are able to develop and execute their own independent studies with easy-to-use sampling kits interactive insights and comparisons tools using the world’s largest human microbiome database.Looking foractionable insights?Need to uncover the potential bacteria behind your leaky gut or other symptoms? Learn about SmartGut™, the first clinical microbiome test.Learn moreHow it worksSampleOur sample kit contains everything you need to swab and submit your microbiome. 
Whether for your mouth, ears, nose, gut, or genitals, your kit will allow you to learn more about your microbiome. You swipe the sample swab across the corresponding site and send the kit back to us.   Expect to get your results back 4-6 weeks after we receive your sample.SequenceWe extract the bacterial DNA out of your sample. Then, we identify each of the bacteria that the DNA came from. It’s a little like dusting a scene for fingerprints.

We compare the "fingerprints" we find to  our reference library, to determine which bacteria they came from. We then compile your results, making them easy  to understand.ExploreUsing the interactive uBiome Explorer site, you can navigate your results using interactive graphs and charts which allow you to compare your results to those of other groups such as vegetarians, or to your past results.

Health and lifestyle answers you provide from the research survey enable us to show you correlations between other users, to existing peer-reviewed studies, and to your previous samples.Explorer sampling kitGut ExplorerFive Site ExplorerTime Lapse ExplorerGut sample tubeReplacement sample tube2 sterile swabsSample return bagReturn mailerNose sample tubeMouth sample tubeGut sample tubeSkin sample tubeGenital sample tubeReplacement sample tube6 sterile swabsSample return bagReturn mailer“uBiome is offering a never before available look into the billions of microbiota that affect the way your body functions.

How do I update my address?How long will my kit last?Do I need to activate my kit?I am having a problem activating my kit.I can't find my sampling instructions!How many tubes should be in my kit?I knocked over a tube/my dog chewed my swabs/I contaminated my sample!How do I collect my sample?Will my gut sample smell?What kind of results will I get?Will I be able to download my raw data?What is the difference between uBiome Explorer™ and SmartGut™?How can I contact you by telephone?Though we can handle most issues promptly through email (support@ubiome.com), we understand that sometimes you just want to speak to a person. Not a problem! You can book a time to speak to us here.How long can I store my Explorer kit?You can keep your uBiome Explorer Collection Kit up to the date provided on the tube at room temperature, which is about one year. You can keep tubes containing samples up to a month at room temperature.How do I register or activate my Explorer kit?In accordance with our strict CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratory standards, we cannot start processing your sample until you confirm your sample collection date, time, and SmartGut™ tube number. With your kit at hand, please enter this information at smartgut.ubiome.com to ensure that we can start processing your sample as soon we receive it.What if my kit is missing items?If your Explorer Kit is missing any item, please email support@ubiome.com and we’ll send you what you need as soon as possible.In which countries are Explorer Kits available?We ship uBiome Explorer kits to almost every country in the worldOur uBiome Explorer Kits can be shipped to almost every country in the world. Our kits comply with all IATA regulations for exempt samples and sending and receiving your samples should not be a problem. You can return your sample via regular mail as it is shelf-stable for over a month. There is an additional $20 shipping charge for international (non-US) orders.Can I sequence my child’s microbiome?Yes, your children (including babies) can have their microbiome sequenced with parental permission. For kids under 18, a parent or guardian will need to sign a consent form, confirming they would like us to process their child's sample. For children over 13, the child will also need to give their assent (non-binding approval) to make sure they understand what microbime sequencing involves. See the full consent forms at here.How do I collect my sample?All instructions for the kit you ordered are available online, once you activate your kit. Please go to app.ubiome.com and follow the instructions there. You'll find out interesting tidbits like how long to swab for and what to do with your sample, before sending it back to us.If you have questions, email support@ubiome.com.Which tube should I use for my sample?There are several types of kits, and the most popular is the Explorer Gut Kit. This kit includes a gut sample tube, a swab, inner and outer return envelopes, and a spare tube in case you make a mistake or want to add another site. The other sites include additional tubes and swabs. You probably did get everything you need, but in case you didn't or if you aren't sure, just send us an email at support@ubiome.com.Will my gut sample smell?Not at all. We need only a very small sample (just enough to tint the sterile swab), which you’ll immediately put into the sample tube (containing lysing solution), and then dispose of the used swab and close the tube.When will I get my results?We start sequencing samples as soon as we receive them, but it usually takes 4-6 weeks to process the samples and compile the results. Of course it's possible there could be delays due to unforeseen circumstances, so it's probably wise not to make any plans that depend on your results being available at a specific time.What kind of results will I get with SmartGut™?After your sample has been analyzed, you get to be an explorer and learn about the vast rainforest of bacteria in your body. Logging in to uBiome.com, you'll see detailed information on each of these bacteria - what their names are, how many of each kind there are, what their functions are in the body. 
You may find yourself curious to compare your results with the aggregate results of everyone who's done the test, and with specific groups of people. Say you want to look at how your microbiome compares to vegans or smokers. You can do that!How can you tell which microorganisms are in my Explorer sample?We use 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing on an Illumina Next Generation Sequencer to find out which kinds of bacteria and other microorganisms are in your gut. Based on a ribosomal gene present in microbial DNA (16S), 16S rRNA gene sequencing enables us to classify microbes all the way down to the genus and/or species level while filtering out any genetic material from humans and other organisms.This is the same sequencing method used in the majority of microbiome studies in this area, so it gives us the greatest ability to compare with other studies, making your data more relevant.What if I’m having issues registering or activating my Explorer Collection Kit?You might need to update your version of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. If you are still having issues, email support@ubiome.com and we will do our best to help.What if I’ve damaged or contaminated my sample or sample tube?Not to worry. Your kit includes a replacement sample tube and a second swab, just in case you need it. If you need additional replacement items, just email support@ubiome.com and we will send you what you need, or replace your kit, as soon as possible.How can I contact you by telephone?Email is actually the fastest way to get answers to your questions. Our expert support team (support@ubiome.com) will respond to your query within 24-48 hours.Do you ship outside the United States?Yes! We accept payment through major credit cards and will ship to almost every country in the world. Our kits comply with all IATA regulations for exempt samples and sending and receiving your samples should not be a problem. You can return your sample via regular mail as it is shelf-stable for over a month. There is an additional $20 shipping charge for international (non-US) orders.When can I expect my kit to arrive?Standard shipping on domestic orders will deliver your kit within 5-10 business days. For international orders, delivery can sometimes take several weeks. If you need your kit(s) more quickly, please make sure to select an expedited shipping option at checkout.When will I get my results?We start sequencing samples as soon as we receive them, but it usually takes 4-6 weeks to process the samples and compile the results. Of course it's possible there could be delays due to unforeseen circumstances, so it's probably wise not to make any plans that depend on your results being available at a specific time.I am moving. How do I update my address?Please send us an email at support@ubiome.com and we will update it for you!How long will my kit last?uBiome kits can be stored for up to one year at room temperatures before taking your samples. Once you've sampled, the tubes can survive comfortably at room temperature for a month. But it's best if you return your samples to us as promptly as possible.Do I need to activate my kit?Yes. We absolutely need you to activate your kit before sending us your samples. There is a questionnaire for each sample site which will greatly improve the value of the information we give you. Plus, we need you to electronically give your authorization before we can process your samples.And also so we know who the kit belongs to!

We can help you out if you are having difficulty, or we can troubleshoot on our end if something isn't working the way it should.I can't find my sampling instructions!All the instructions are on the website when you activate your kit. Just go to app.ubiome.com and go from there.How many tubes should be in my kit?There are several types of kits, and the most popular is the gut-only kit. This kit includes a gut sample vial, a swab, inner and outer return envelopes, and a spare tube in case you make a mistake or want to add another site. The other sites include additional tubes and swabs. You probably did get everything you need, but in case you didn't or if you aren't sure, just send us an email at support@ubiome.com.I knocked over a tube/my dog chewed my swabs/I contaminated my sample!Our kits come with a spare tube and swab, so any mistake can be remedied by using the spare included. If you should still need a replacement, just email at support@ubiome.com and we'll send you a replacement immediately.How do I collect my sample?All instructions for the kit you ordered are available online, once you activate your kit. Please go to app.ubiome.com and follow the instructions there. You'll find out interesting tidbits like how long to swab for and what to do with your sample, before sending it back to us. We also made a handy little video for you about sampling your skin microbiome. You can watch it here.If you're having trouble locating the instructions, they've been transcribed in full below:1. STARTSampling takes less than 3 min per site. Faster than a dividing bacteria!We recommend you leave your kit on your bathroom counter so it's ready first thing in the morning.Sample first thing in the morning, before you brush your teeth or eat breakfast.2. SAMPLEOpen the tube you want to sample and the follow the site-specific instructions below:GUTSwab your used toilet paper to collect a tiny amount of poop.Note - this probably way less than you think you need - just enough to change the color of the swab.MOUTHVigorously rub the swab across the inside of each cheek for 30 seconds.Note - do not touch your teeth or gums to the swab.SKIN Wet the swab with the PCR water included in your kit. (Do not use regular water.)Swab along the lower half of the crease behind your ear for 1 minute.Note - pull your ear forward with one hand and pull your hair out of the way if necessary.NOSE Wet the swab with the PCR water included in your kit. (Do not use regular water.)Swab around the inside of each nostril at the depth of the cotton on the swab for 30 seconds each.MALE GENITALSWet the swab with the PCR water included in your kit. (Do not use regular water.)Swab in a circular motion around the base of the head of the penis for one minute (where the head of the penis intersects the shaft).Note - if your penis is uncircumcised, pull back your foreskin first.FEMALE GENITALSWet the swab with the PCR water included in your kit. (Do not use regular water.)Squat slightly and insert the swab as far as possible while still comfortable into the vagina. Swish it around for one minute to collect your sample.Note - spread your labia with one hand and use the other to swab.3. STIR AND SHAKEPut the used swab into the vial and stir it for 1 minute to transfer the bacteria.Discard the swab in the trash.Close the tube tightly and shake vigorously for 1 minute.4. SENDAll of kits include a secure mailer, so that you can send your samples right back to us.US kits come with prepaid postage. Just drop the envelope in the mail.Will my gut sample smell?No. The amount of the sample needed is quite small, and the cotton swab goes immediately into the lysing solution in a closed container. Nothing smelly at all.What kind of results will I get?After your sample has been analyzed, you get to be an explorer and learn about the vast rainforest of bacteria in your body. Logging in to uBiome.com, you'll see detailed information on each of these bacteria - what their names are, how many of each kind there are, what their functions are in the body. You may find yourself curious to compare your results with the aggregate results of everyone who's done the test, and with specific groups of people. Say you want to look at how your microbiome compares to vegans, or smokers, or people on antibiotics. You can do that!It’s important to be aware that uBiome is designed to be a tool for personal research, NOT a diagnostic tool. You won't find any predictions about your future health. And your results will not diagnose any medical condition.What you will find is a chance to better understand your microbiome, how you compare to others, and even how you compare to yourself over time. (Before and after going gluten-free or starting a new medication, for example.) Last but not least, you may find a warm glow in your heart from knowing that you are contributing to advancements in research that may have tremendous benefit for the future of human health and well-being.Will I be able to download my raw data?Absolutely! From your sample's Dashboard, you will have the opportunity to click either "Download Taxonomy (CSV)" or “Download Taxonomy (JSON)” or “Download Sequence Data” from the advanced tab.Taxonomy files are a summary of all the microbes we found in your sample, which you can see either as a spreadsheet (CSV) or in an easy machine-readable form (JSON) suitable for analysis in a programming language like Python. The taxonomy includes details about the specific microbes, their taxonomic rank, the percentage abundance in the sample, and more.  Sequence data is the complete, raw FASTQ files downloaded directly from our high-speed gene sequencing machine.For a more complete tutorial on what to do with your raw data, read Richard Sprague's article on our blog.What is the difference between uBiome Explorer™ and SmartGut™?uBiome Explorer™ is a citizen science tool to explore the microbiome of the nose, mouth, skin, gut, and genitals, and to track changes in the microbiome. It includes online interactive tools to help you understand how your bacteria compare to others and yourself over time. SmartGut is a clinical laboratory test ordered by healthcare providers for patients with chronic gut conditions. It detects 26 bacterial targets at a high level of accuracy to better understand: 1) if there are specific pathogens present that might be causing illness, 2) the balance of commensal and beneficial bacteria that may be contributing to your symptoms, and 3) risk factors relating to the microbiome.SmartGut™ vs. Explorer™ InfographicWhat is uBiome?How are you involving the public in your work?Does the uBiome research study have Institutional Review Board approval?How do you ensure the privacy of user data and results?Does uBiome collaborate on a research and citizen scientist studies?How do I get the latest uBiome news?What is uBiome?uBiome is the leading microbial genomics company, providing state-of-the-art DNA sequencing to healthcare patients and citizen scientists.

In Jessica Richman’s vision of the future, meals will be designed according to each individual’s mix of gut bacteria, and consumers will choose their facial creams based on an analysis of the micro-organisms in their skin.That future is just around the corner, thanks in large part to innovations at uBiome Inc., the San Francisco-based company Ms. Richman co-founded four years ago. The company uses next-generation DNA sequencing to give consumers and health-care professionals greater insights into the micro-organisms – collectively known as microbiome – in their bodies.

“A microbiome is an environment – microbiota is actually the technical term for it – populated by micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses,” says Ms. Richman, CEO of uBiome. The company offers testing kits – available in consumer- and clinical-grade versions – for bacteria in the gut, mouth, nose, skin and genitals.“At uBiome we started with 2,500 microbiome samples and we now have 100,000, which is the largest data set in the world for human microbiome. What that means is we can find insights on the microbiome that no one else can.”The firm’s technology is among a wave of innovations expected to transform the way people take care of themselves by providing DNA-based analyses of their bodies’ systems. The emergence of these futuristic technologies, Ms. Richman says, sets the stage for truly personalized health care.Big data and citizen science are used to inform uBiome analyses. How does the citizen science part of this work?The idea with citizen science is that you don’t have to have a PhD or work in a research institution to do science. A good example of citizen science at work is in the field of ornithology, where they use amateur birdwatchers to help gather data on birds.At UBiome, we basically have people doing experiments on themselves and then use the data they’ve gathered to help answer their questions. The experiments range from quite serious to quite silly. On the serious side, there are those people who want to test their hypothesis on what might improve their gut biome – like, if they take probiotics or do elimination diet, will that lower the gut inflammation? Then there are the fun experiments, like people sampling the bacteria on their kitchen counter or sampling their babies just to see how their microbiome changes as they grow.And what kind of insights would they gain from these experiments?For people who do the five-site test – where they sample the nose, mouth, skin, gut and genitals – they might learn that their microbiome is similar to a particular group of people with particular hygiene habits or oral concerns.What’s the point of this type of information?First of all, we don’t provide disease diagnosis. So we can’t, for example, say you are prone to gum disease, but we can give people statistics about their microbiome that they can take to their dentist to discuss possible interventions. We do provide more in-depth analyses for our medical-grade product, such as identifying if a patient microbiome falls within a healthy range, and what specific conditions and infections are associated with certain pathogens and microbes.What are other applications for microbiome testing?There are a lot of business opportunities for collaboration to take this big data set and use them to build products. We’re currently working with a Fortune 500 cosmetics company that has asked us to help them develop a diagnostic for skin cream. So our test would look at specific bacteria in skin and then, based on the results, the consumer would know they belong to a specific type of skin biome, and that this specific skin cream is the best for their skin biome. We’re doing similar things with food companies, such as yogurt companies. It’s really cool because it gives us this extra reach into other industries.Looking far into the future, where do you see microbiome testing in the health-care ecosystem?I see the integration of microbiome testing into our lives. I see everyone getting their microbiome tested, and this will lead to them getting more personalized products and services. Imagine having a customized meal kit based on your microbiome.If your results show that your microbiome isn’t very diverse, the kit would be customized to include foods like broccoli, which promotes beneficial bacteria. So the food you eat will actually be scientifically chosen and optimized for your health. I also think the medical side will have serious applications that can really help people who are suffering from things like chronic gut condition. Some of these people suffer for years – microbiome testing can help their doctors diagnose and treat the conditions based on DNA data.This is the last of three profiles of speakers appearing at The Globe and Mail’s inaugural Executive Performance Summit, which takes place in Toronto on Nov. 16.
