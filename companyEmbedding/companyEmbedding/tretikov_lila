Lila Tretikov (English: /ˈlaɪ̯lə ˈtrɛtɪkɔf/), born Olga (Lyalya[1]) Tretyakova (Russian: Ольга (Ляля) Третьяко́ва; January 25, 1978[2] in Moscow[3][4]) is a Russian–American engineer and manager, who was executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation from 2014 to 2016.
Born in Moscow, she emigrated to the United States as a teenager and in 1999 began working as a software engineer in California, where she co-authored several software patents and also founded a technology marketing company. A specialist in enterprise software, she was chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc, before succeeding Sue Gardner at the Wikimedia Foundation in 2014.
On February 25, 2016, Tretikov tendered her resignation, effective March 31,[5] as a result of the WMF's handling of the Knowledge Engine project.[6][7]

Early life and education[edit]
Tretikov is of Russian and Swedish heritage. Her father is a mathematician and her mother was a filmmaker.[8] After moving to New York City at age 15,[9] she learned English while waitressing and attended the University of California, Berkeley, but left before completing her degree.[10] Her majors were computer science and art, and she researched machine learning.[10]

Tretikov introduced to WMF employees.


Career[edit]
In 1999, Tretikov started her professional career at Sun Microsystems, as an engineer at the Sun-Netscape Alliance, where she worked on the Java server[clarification needed]. She then founded GrokDigital, a technology marketing company, and was later appointed chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc.[11]
In 2012, she was a Stevie Awards bronze winner in the category for "Female Executive of the Year‍—‌Business Services‍—‌11 to 2,500 Employees‍—‌Computer Hardware & Software".[12] She has co-authored several patents in intelligent data mapping and dynamic language applications.[13][14]
Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014 in succession to Sue Gardner,[15][16] and took up the post on June 1, 2014. She had edited Wikipedia only once before her appointment.[13][17]
Tretikov is also on the boards of OpenEd[18] and Rackspace[19] and is an advisor to the board of Zamurai Corporation.[citation needed]
Tretikov resigned from the Wikimedia Foundation, as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff,[6][7] with her last day being March 31, 2016[5] (succeeded by Katherine Maher in March 2016). On March 16, 2016, it was announced that Tretikov had been invited by the World Economic Forum to join its "Young Global Leaders" community.[20]

Lila Tretikov (English: /ˈlaɪ̯lə ˈtrɛtɪkɔf/), born Olga (Lyalya[1]) Tretyakova (Russian: Ольга (Ляля) Третьяко́ва; January 25, 1978[2] in Moscow[3][4]) is a Russian–American engineer and manager, who was executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation from 2014 to 2016.
Born in Moscow, she emigrated to the United States as a teenager and in 1999 began working as a software engineer in California, where she co-authored several software patents and also founded a technology marketing company. A specialist in enterprise software, she was chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc, before succeeding Sue Gardner at the Wikimedia Foundation in 2014.
On February 25, 2016, Tretikov tendered her resignation, effective March 31,[5] as a result of the WMF's handling of the Knowledge Engine project.[6][7]

Early life and education[edit]
Tretikov is of Russian and Swedish heritage. Her father is a mathematician and her mother was a filmmaker.[8] After moving to New York City at age 15,[9] she learned English while waitressing and attended the University of California, Berkeley, but left before completing her degree.[10] Her majors were computer science and art, and she researched machine learning.[10]

Tretikov introduced to WMF employees.


Career[edit]
In 1999, Tretikov started her professional career at Sun Microsystems, as an engineer at the Sun-Netscape Alliance, where she worked on the Java server[clarification needed]. She then founded GrokDigital, a technology marketing company, and was later appointed chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc.[11]
In 2012, she was a Stevie Awards bronze winner in the category for "Female Executive of the Year‍—‌Business Services‍—‌11 to 2,500 Employees‍—‌Computer Hardware & Software".[12] She has co-authored several patents in intelligent data mapping and dynamic language applications.[13][14]
Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014 in succession to Sue Gardner,[15][16] and took up the post on June 1, 2014. She had edited Wikipedia only once before her appointment.[13][17]
Tretikov is also on the boards of OpenEd[18] and Rackspace[19] and is an advisor to the board of Zamurai Corporation.[citation needed]
Tretikov resigned from the Wikimedia Foundation, as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff,[6][7] with her last day being March 31, 2016[5] (succeeded by Katherine Maher in March 2016). On March 16, 2016, it was announced that Tretikov had been invited by the World Economic Forum to join its "Young Global Leaders" community.[20]

Saving Wikipedia: Meet Lila Tretikov










 








































































Time.com




































Saving Wikipedia: Meet Lila Tretikov
Lila Tretikov, a 36-year-old Soviet-born software expert, oversees the world's largest free repository of information.



















Early last month, the San Francisco-based non-profit entity that operates Wikipedia.org announced that it was teaming up with the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups to sue the National Security Agency. The suit claimed that the NSA’s mass surveillance program, largely exposed by the 2013 Edward Snowden leaks, violates U.S. constitutional protections. “The NSA is threatening the intellectual freedom that is central to people’s ability to create and understand knowledge,” Lila Tretikov, the executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, declared at the time.
Even before bringing the lawsuit, Wikipedia had positioned itself at the forefront of a push for the free exchange of information. Tretikov, 37, sits at the helm of the world’s largest source of free knowledge, and the world’s autocrats don’t seem to like it much: Last November, the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that it would create an alternative to the site to portray Russia more “objectively and accurately.” In China, hundreds of the site’s 800,000 Chinese language articles are censored. And Iran routinely blocks access to Farsi-language pages on topics like the 1979 Revolution and the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
It’s not hard to see why. As the general Internet population has grown—from 500 million in 2001 to nearly 3 billion today—Wikipedia is becoming the platform most responsible for shaping our general knowledge. Fourteen years after its inception, the crowd-sourced encyclopedia is the web’s sixth most-visited site, with about 500 million unique readers a month and 36 million articles, including 4.9 million in English. It is available in 288 languages. And its database allows search engines such as Microsoft’s Bing and personal digital assistants like Google Now to answer common-language queries such as “Who is Putin?” or “How do you make a Moscow Mule?” (Studies of the site’s accuracy over the years have yielded surprisingly good results.)
In many ways, Wikipedia represents the utopian ideals of the early Internet as conceived by the researchers and academics who created it: a vast database of knowledge, available to all humanity, for free, forever. For millennia, encyclopedias have been a hallmark of civilization, from the enormous Four Great Books of Song of 11th-century China to the crowning intellectual achievement of the Enlightenment Era, the humanist Encyclopédie banned by monarchs across Europe. It is the original cloud. Or as Wikimedia’s “vision statement” puts it: “Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. That’s our commitment.” But as the Web has spread around the globe, becoming an engine of commerce more than an academic or literary paradise, the place of a free website run by a nonprofit and largely curated by a handful of volunteers is far from certain.



Indeed, the future of Wikipedia has increasingly come into doubt over the past few years. Some observers question how long the website can stay relevant. Behemoths like Google and Facebook—the first and second largest websites, respectively—have billions of dollars at their disposal to pursue lofty goals like cataloguing the sum of knowledge or connecting every human being to the Internet. By contrast, Tretikov heads a non-profit with a relatively meager annual budget of $59 million that comes almost entirely from donations. A team of about 215 full-time employees headquartered in San Francisco oversees the work of roughly 85,000 active volunteer editors who seem to have divergent views about almost everything, from proper punctuation to the role that the Foundation should play in the operation of the site. “I do not envy Lila Tretikov’s position,” says William Beutler, a Wikipedia editor since 2006 and author of The Wikipedian, a blog that reports on the goings-on of the website and its army of editors.
Lack of resources is not Wikipedia’s only challenge. It also struggles from demographics that undermine its central mission. The makeup of its editing community is largely white and male. Women comprise an estimated 10% of editors. That has led to critical gaps in coverage about topics ranging from women’s health to the history of Botswana (compared to, say, the history of Montana). Meanwhile, the total number of people regularly making edits has shrunk: active English-language editors have fallen by 35% since 2007, though the figure ticked up slightly last year. Tretikov says the growing numbers of Internet users around the world will provide new editors to help fill subject gaps. But if that doesn’t happen, one of the Web’s greatest institutions could start to crumble.
Tretikov, who describes herself as a “classic geek,” was born in 1978 in Moscow. She grew up in the waning days of the Soviet Union, when free and open information was in short supply. She recalls her father, then a professor at Moscow State, and her mother, a filmmaker, cautioning her not to repeat their kitchen conversations in grade school. Tretikov palpably remembers the liberating effect of the government’s Glasnost policy in the late 1980s, like when her mother burst into tears hearing the previously proscribed music of Vladimir Vysotsky on TV. “I grew up with these ideals of freedom of speech and the sense of how precious and incredibly vulnerable that is,” she says in her accented but fluent English.
Three years after the Soviet Union collapsed, at age 16, she left for the United States by herself to live with an uncle who had fled years earlier. She attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she studied a subcategory of artificial intelligence. She left in her final months without a degree to join Sun Microsystems in 1999 before eventually becoming a major figure in the open-sourced software movement of the 2000s.
Around the same time, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger co-founded Wikipedia as a side project to Nupedia, an online encyclopedia they planned to fill with peer-reviewed content written by experts. The Wiki version—“wiki” means “quick” in Hawaiian and was an early term used to describe collaborative online content—allowed for anyone, regardless of background, to create a new page or make an edit to existing articles. It took off, and by the end of the year had nearly 20,000 articles in 18 languages. In 2003, Wales, or “Jimbo” as he’s known in the community, created the non-profit Wikimedia Foundation to fund and operate the servers behind Wikipedia while leaving control over content in the hands of the growing editing community. Today, there are roughly 10 edits a second on Wikipedia and sister projects like Wikimedia Commons, a database of free media like photos.



Tretikov, with a mix of technical experience and a track record in the open-source software community, was recruited by Sue Gardner, a former journalist who had overseen the Foundation’s rapid growth since 2007. When she joined the Wikimedia Foundation in May, she found it had ballooned but its technological efforts had been lackluster. And a 2013 attempt to create a new, simplified interface for editing articles had prompted a backlash from members who found it buggy and oversimplified. Ultimately the “upgrade” was reversed by an editor. “It’s definitely a very long thought-about and long-desired shift in the focus of the organization towards product and tech,” says Wales, now a member of the board of trustees that works with the Foundation and helped select Tretikov. “We’re a funny organization because in some ways you can think of us as a cultural institution and a non-profit organization. But at the same time we run this massive website.”
The tensions can sometimes resemble those that roil political parties in transition. It can be an inhospitable place for new editors. A neophyte editor who hits “edit” on an article will be presented with text that looks more like code than prose. If she still manages to make her edit, she then faces the high likelihood that her change will be reverted back by a cadre of veteran editors policing for so-called “vandalism” but also for edits that don’t align with the community’s extensive set of norms.
Finally, if she continues to edit and even participates in discussions, she will often encounter raucous, male-dominated debates. Jerome Hergueux, an affiliate researcher at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society who studies collaborative production models like Wikipedia, says that in 2011 only about 2% of the 200,000 accounts created on English Wikipedia each month made more than 10 edits in their first month. Of that 2%, roughly a tenth were still editing the following year. “It’s a social engineering problem,” Hergueux says.
These problems may be symptomatic of Wikipedia’s quasi-public state of being. But new ones have arisen. Search engines that pull content from Wikipedia pages to post with search results highlight Wikipedia’s value, for example, but they also divert users from actually going to Wikipedia. That harms the site because while people consume the information, they’re less likely to become part of the community and start editing. The global shift toward mobile Internet traffic has also made it more difficult to add new edits to the site because potential editors have so far been reluctant to make changes from their phones or tablets.
For now, it’s not clear that the decline in editors has reduced the quality of its content. But observers say Wikipedia could still see a sudden drop off, like when the Italian-language version saw its number of active editors fall by nearly 25% over 10 months in 2013. That’s one scenario. “The other one, which is scarier, is the prospect of a slow, long drawn-out decline that is almost imperceptible,” says Andrew Lih, a professor of journalism at American University and the author of the 2009 book The Wikipedia Revolution. “It’s kind of like the boiling frogs scenario,” he adds.



To fight back, Tretikov is focusing the Foundation’s limited resources on how readers and editors use the site. She prioritized efforts to gather data on what users like and don’t and plans to add some 35 new engineers. The moves have brought the organization more in line with how its private sector peers in Silicon Valley operate. “I’m focusing a lot on our product direction, on our technical capacity to do things, and how we establish what we need to be doing next,” she says. The team has rolled out and updated sleek new iOS and Android apps and streamlined the editing process on mobile. Since last July, a fifth of first-time edits on Wikimedia sites have been on mobile.
Tretikov is also moving to fill in gaps in content. Last month, the Foundation launched the “Inspire Campaign” to elicit proposals for boosting gender diversity, pledging $250,000 to fund some of the ideas. Since she joined, it has expanded its Wikipedia Zero program, which partners with wireless carriers to provide free mobile access to Wikipedia, to an additional 38 countries, including Burma, Ghana and Morocco. Tretikov hopes this will lead to an influx of new, more diverse readers and ultimately editors. The foundation is working on an automatic translation tool to let users to create new articles based on existing pages in other languages
Then there are the legions of editors who are necessary for the site’s continued vitality, but also can be a bane for the Foundation to deal with. In one particularly caustic case in August, she drew the wrath of some editors when her team rolled out the Media Viewer, which displays thumbnail images in larger size without providing full details about the image. Critics of the change, particularly vocal editors of the German Wikipedia, were incensed when the Foundation blocked any editor from turning back the change. “I want victory over the WMF,” said one commentator on German Wikipedia, using the Foundation’s acronym. “I want the WMF to shudder when they remember this case.” The Foundation lifted the restriction on changes, but the Media Viewer is still the default image viewer on Wikipedia.
“It’s not realistic to have everybody always in the boat with you,” Tretikov says. Beutler puts the issue less diplomatically: “The Wikipedia community is full of old timers who are used to getting their way and don’t like things changing, and I think it’s important that the community always be forced to rethink, is Wikipedia everything that it can be right now?”
Tretikov says she is committed to trying to get it there. “Wikipedia was revolutionary because it just changed how an Encyclopedia is created and shared,” she says. “It was fantastic and we’ve done an incredible job. But for the next roughly half of the population, the story is going to be very different.”

Lila Tretikov was still a child when the Soviet Union began to embrace glasnost in the 1980s. The new freedoms enabled Tretikov, an academically brilliant student, to move from Moscow to New York by herself, waitressing to learn English and pay for her last year of high school.
By the end of the year she was top of her Shakespeare class. Tretikov has since spent 18 years studying computer science and working with collaborative, “open source” software – and in May beat 1,300 candidates to the job of executive director of the world’s fifth largest website, Wikipedia.
For Tretikov, there are parallels between glasnost and Wikipedia’s own aspirations of transparency and openness. “Glasnost was a phenomenal, renaissance period in the history of Russia and taught me much about importance of freedom of information,” Tretikov told the Guardian in her first interview.
“The only real way to improve conditions of civilisations is to provide open access to information for education and culture, and to be honest about the past. Otherwise we spend our lives siloed from each other and we repeat the mistakes of our grandparents.”
Tretikov’s academic work on machine learning got her a job at Sun Microsystems in 1999, and she founded her own marketing technology firm, GrokDigital, the following year. It was when she joined Silicon Valley’s SugarCRM, which offers customer management software for businesses, that she was able to expand her interest in open source software, where the source code is published, shared and improved with the developer community.
Speaking in soft, heavily accented American, Tretikov, 36, is ambitious about Wikipedia’s future. Yet her appointment was controversial among some of Wikipedia’s notoriously boisterous community of volunteer editors.
The community includes a hardcore of around 3,000 volunteers who have all made at least 20,000 individual edits . When Tretikov admitted in a post that she had only just made her first edit on the English Wikipedia site there was an inevitable backlash, even though she explained that she had done so to understand the difficulties of first-time editors.
“We ended up with an amateur, and that’s pretty frightening,” wrote veteran editor Pete Forsyth in a leaked email. “If she’s got no keel on the open sea, who knows where her take on the community will wash up? It doesn’t give me a lot of hope that she can chart a better course through the crippling dynamics of the last couple years.”

Others were offended that her boyfriend, developer Wil Sinclair, had joined a site that scrutinises Wikipedia and its editors, describing Sinclair as “her uninvited plus one”. It prompted a characteristically rational response from Tretikov. “I make my decisions using my own professional judgement,” she wrote at the time. “I don’t consult Wil on [Wikipedian] matters, ask him to do anything on my behalf or monitor his engagements with the community … We have always both been extremely independent.”
There is often tension between volunteers and management in Wikipedia. A men’s rights group claimed a “feminist conspiracy” was censoring its views on the site. It is a challenge for Tretikov to gain the confidence of its male-dominated volunteers, many of whom have worked on the site for years to establish its processes and norms, while at the same time making the site more appealing and accessible to new, more diverse editors.
Diversity is a big problem, with Wikipedia dominated by white, western men. Thirteen years since it launched, the site publishes and maintains more than 32m articles in 287 languages, all run through a complex and often exhaustingly democratic system of voting and consensus. But women are estimated to account for only 15% of the 80,000 regular editors, and volunteers in the developing world are also under-represented.
“The most important thing for us is to lower the barrier to entry to this knowledge-building community,” she says. “Our mission is to educate, so the more open we can be to different types of thinking, the more diverse we will be.”
As the only non-commercial site of its scale, Wikipedia is an anomaly among the household names of the web. It remains a uniquely complex organisation, and Tretikov will have to help sustain its finances; the site costs $29m (£17.2m) a year to run, and relies on charitable grants and donations from users, which increased from $4m to $45m under Tretikov’s predecessor Sue Gardner. If it chose to display adverts to nearly half a billion people that use the site each month – as some commentators have pushed for – it could make nearly $3bn per year, by one estimate.
“Knowledge is all about trust,” says Tretikov. “Not being beholden to demands of the market gives us freedom to do the right thing for the user first and foremost. It allows us to be much more focused on the users and what their needs are.”

  A very early Wikipedia homepage from 2001.


As the largest single source of free information in the world, Wikipedia also has to battle misinformation by corporations and governments, and is already being defended by some automated software or ‘bots’ that publish a Twitter notification when articles relating to Congress, parliament or other public bodies have been edited by an insider.
Recent efforts have started to overhaul the site’s editing system to make it easier and less technically demanding for new editors, but automated software could help here too. The English language Wikipedia already has nearly 2,000 approved bots, and across the whole Wikipedia networks bots accounted for 15% of Wikipedia’s 19bn page views during July 2014. These programmes perform an array of mundane tasks from correcting spelling to updating standard census statistics and even reversing vandalism.
“In the future, an editor without coding skills will have access to tools that could allow him or her to automatically scan, identify, and fill gaps in the knowledge with a few clicks of a button,” she says. “[Programmers] are thinking about how we can augment and improve what humans do by handing off the grunt work to the machines - enabling us to focus on the creative, ingenious tasks. Our biggest challenge is to understand how things are changing in the way humans experience technology and be there for those that aren’t even online yet.”
Tretikov said she recognised concern about the increasing use of machines to automate human tasks. “But computers are definitely much better than humans at processing large amounts of information, which is why that’s where we use them most. There are emerging areas where bots could help us identify interesting things – that doesn’t make computers creative in and of themselves, but they do help us amplify our own creativity.”
Given the site’s experiments with automation and Tretikov’s academic interest in artificial intelligence (she has co-authored several patents), it is no surprise that her vision for Wikipedia is to assert itself as a technology company, rather than a media firm. Her first real test will come on Saturday, when she stands before the real-world congregation of Wikipedia to set out her plans for its future.
“The only thing we can do to change things, is to charge ahead and change things through actions, through trying. Who knows, in 50 years we could be trying to help men change the status quo of the world, where women have been proven the capable ones.”
Wikipedia: in numbers

Number of articlesOverall, there are 32,695,787 articles on Wikipedia. But in the English-language version, there are 4,573,131 articles. In its first year (2001-2002), 19,700 articles were written. So far in 2014, 160,280 have been written. In 2013, 280,000 new articles were added


PopularityWikipedia is the sixth most popular website in the world after Google, Facebook, YouTube, Yahoo! and Baidu according to Alexa, June 2014


Global WikipediaThere are currently 287 language versions of Wikipedia. Eleven language versions have over 1 million articles. The Waray-Waray Wikipedia is one of these, with 1,074,000 articles. Waray-Waray is spoken in the Eastern Visayas of the Philippines


Content30% of articles pertain to culture; 15% are biographical; 14% are geographical; 12% are social sciences; and 11% are historical


ControversyIn 2008, UK ISPs blocked access to the article on 1976 death metal album Virgin Killer after child pornography complaints were made against the image used as the album’s title sleeve


AccoladesIn 2006, Time magazine threw out the rulebook and named all of the people who edited Wikipedia and other user-generated content as their Person of the Year


Contributors69% of editors say they had to fix an error. 73% of contributors like to share their knowledge. 19% of editors hold Masters degrees; 4.4% hold PhDs, and 13% are women

• Wikimania, the annual Wikimedia Foundation conference, runs from 6-10 August at London’s Barbican Centre
• This article was amended on 12 August 2014 to clarify that Lila Tretikov edited the site for the first time to understand the problems of first-time editors.

Lila Tretikov (English: /ˈlaɪ̯lə ˈtrɛtɪkɔf/), born Olga (Lyalya[1]) Tretyakova (Russian: Ольга (Ляля) Третьяко́ва; January 25, 1978[2] in Moscow[3][4]) is a Russian–American engineer and manager, who was executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation from 2014 to 2016.
Born in Moscow, she emigrated to the United States as a teenager and in 1999 began working as a software engineer in California, where she co-authored several software patents and also founded a technology marketing company. A specialist in enterprise software, she was chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc, before succeeding Sue Gardner at the Wikimedia Foundation in 2014.
On February 25, 2016, Tretikov tendered her resignation, effective March 31,[5] as a result of the WMF's handling of the Knowledge Engine project.[6][7]

Early life and education[edit]
Tretikov is of Russian and Swedish heritage. Her father is a mathematician and her mother was a filmmaker.[8] After moving to New York City at age 15,[9] she learned English while waitressing and attended the University of California, Berkeley, but left before completing her degree.[10] Her majors were computer science and art, and she researched machine learning.[10]

Tretikov introduced to WMF employees.


Career[edit]
In 1999, Tretikov started her professional career at Sun Microsystems, as an engineer at the Sun-Netscape Alliance, where she worked on the Java server[clarification needed]. She then founded GrokDigital, a technology marketing company, and was later appointed chief information officer and vice president of engineering at SugarCRM Inc.[11]
In 2012, she was a Stevie Awards bronze winner in the category for "Female Executive of the Year‍—‌Business Services‍—‌11 to 2,500 Employees‍—‌Computer Hardware & Software".[12] She has co-authored several patents in intelligent data mapping and dynamic language applications.[13][14]
Tretikov was appointed executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in May 2014 in succession to Sue Gardner,[15][16] and took up the post on June 1, 2014. She had edited Wikipedia only once before her appointment.[13][17]
Tretikov is also on the boards of OpenEd[18] and Rackspace[19] and is an advisor to the board of Zamurai Corporation.[citation needed]
Tretikov resigned from the Wikimedia Foundation, as a result of the WMF's controversial Knowledge Engine project and disagreements with the staff,[6][7] with her last day being March 31, 2016[5] (succeeded by Katherine Maher in March 2016). On March 16, 2016, it was announced that Tretikov had been invited by the World Economic Forum to join its "Young Global Leaders" community.[20]

Lila Tretikov
Executive Director, Wikimedia Foundation





About me
Lila Tretikov is the Executive Director of the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides equal access to knowledge through services like Wikipedia, the world's largest encyclopedia, available in 285 languages and the fifth most popular website in the world.
Lila has been a leader in the technology space for almost 15 years. Most recently, she served as the Chief Product Officer for the open-source, cloud-based software vendor SugarCRM. SugarCRM sponsored an open source project with more than 30,000 contributors and deployed by over 1.5 million individuals in 120 countries and 26 languages. Lila’s responsibilities during her tenure included product strategy, engineering, operations, IT, product management, professional services, marketing, and user experience. Under her guidance, SugarCRM was recognized as a visionary leader in Customer Relationship Management and Lila was awarded the 9th Stevie Award For Women in Business.
Lila began her career as an engineer at the Sun-Netscape Alliance working on the Java server. She later founded and grew information technology startups to offer support for customers in telecommunication, retail and banking. Her customers included Bank of America, Ameritrade, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Her work on the Human Genome Browser at Berkeley allowed her to combine her passion for large data systems with intelligent user interfaces.
Born in the Soviet Union, Lila experienced first-hand the rise of openness and transparency in government through the policy of glasnost. She developed a commitment to free and open information made possible by passionate people equipped with technology; a commitment she brings to her work at the Wikimedia Foundation and in the Wikimedia movement.
Lila studied Computer Science and Art at the University of California, Berkeley, where she did research work in machine learning. Lila holds patents for intelligent data mapping, dynamic language applications, and other technology innovations.


My work
As the chief executive of the Wikimedia Foundation, I'm responsible for leading the Foundation, setting its strategy, and managing day-to-day operations. It's a central position in a complex global volunteer-driven movement, which is building the largest collection of shared knowledge in human history, used by over a half-billion people around the world.
Disclaimer: I work for or provide services to the Wikimedia Foundation, and this is the account I try to use for edits or statements I make in that role. However, the Foundation does not vet all my activity, so edits, statements, or other contributions made by this account may not reflect the views of the Foundation.
