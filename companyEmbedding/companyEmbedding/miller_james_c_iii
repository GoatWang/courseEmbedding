James Clifford "Jim" Miller III (born June 25, 1942, in Atlanta, Georgia) is a former U.S. government official and economist who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission between 1981 and 1985 and as Budget Director for President Ronald Reagan between 1985 and 1988. He also ran for United States Senate in Virginia, losing the Republican nomination at the convention to Oliver North in 1994 and losing the nomination in the primary to John Warner in 1996.[3][4][5]
Biography[edit]
Miller was born in Atlanta and grew up in Conyers, Georgia. He earned a B.B.A. in economics from the University of Georgia in 1964 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Virginia in 1969.
Between 1977 and 1981, Miller was a resident scholar at the Center for the Study of Government Regulation at the American Enterprise Institute. From 1978 to 1981, he served as co-director of the center.
Miller was the first administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (April - October 1981) and the executive director of Vice President George H. W. Bush's Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief. From 1981 to 1985, he chaired the Federal Trade Commission. From October 1985 to October 1988, Miller was director of the United States Office of Management and Budget.
He is a distinguished fellow at the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University.[6] He is also a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[7]
He has been counselor to and a board member of the former Citizens for a Sound Economy[8] (1988–2002), a member of the boards of the Tax Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, and a member of the board of visitors of George Mason University and the U.S. Air Force Academy. In addition, Miller has been a director of LECG Economics-Finance, a member of the board of Independence Air, a member of the board of Washington Mutual Investors Fund, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Maryland, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Virginia, a member of the board of the J.P. Morgan Value Opportunities Fund, a member of the board of Clean Energy, a consultant to Freddie Mac, and chairman of the board of Economic Impact Analysts, Inc. (family-held consulting firm).[9]
From 2003 to 2006, Miller was chairman (or chairman emeritus) of the Capital Analysis Group (CapAnalysis), a division of the international law firm Howrey LLP. Currently, he is a senior advisor to international law firm of Husch Blackwell Sanders (merger dated March 1, 2008)[10] He was a member of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service (2003–2012), where he was elected chairman in 2005, 2006, and 2007.[11]
On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Miller was picked by the then Premier of the Cayman Islands William McKeeva Bush to lead an independent task force to examine new revenue options for the Cayman Islands Government. The Cayman Islands has no direct taxation although that may change as a result of an agreement with the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK FCO allowed the Cayman Islands Government to borrow additional funds to meet capital and operational expenses as long as the Government agreed to look at ways in which to increase and stabilize its revenue base—direct taxation being the preferred solution.

James Clifford "Jim" Miller III (born June 25, 1942, in Atlanta, Georgia) is a former U.S. government official and economist who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission between 1981 and 1985 and as Budget Director for President Ronald Reagan between 1985 and 1988. He also ran for United States Senate in Virginia, losing the Republican nomination at the convention to Oliver North in 1994 and losing the nomination in the primary to John Warner in 1996.[3][4][5]
Biography[edit]
Miller was born in Atlanta and grew up in Conyers, Georgia. He earned a B.B.A. in economics from the University of Georgia in 1964 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Virginia in 1969.
Between 1977 and 1981, Miller was a resident scholar at the Center for the Study of Government Regulation at the American Enterprise Institute. From 1978 to 1981, he served as co-director of the center.
Miller was the first administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (April - October 1981) and the executive director of Vice President George H. W. Bush's Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief. From 1981 to 1985, he chaired the Federal Trade Commission. From October 1985 to October 1988, Miller was director of the United States Office of Management and Budget.
He is a distinguished fellow at the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University.[6] He is also a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[7]
He has been counselor to and a board member of the former Citizens for a Sound Economy[8] (1988–2002), a member of the boards of the Tax Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, and a member of the board of visitors of George Mason University and the U.S. Air Force Academy. In addition, Miller has been a director of LECG Economics-Finance, a member of the board of Independence Air, a member of the board of Washington Mutual Investors Fund, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Maryland, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Virginia, a member of the board of the J.P. Morgan Value Opportunities Fund, a member of the board of Clean Energy, a consultant to Freddie Mac, and chairman of the board of Economic Impact Analysts, Inc. (family-held consulting firm).[9]
From 2003 to 2006, Miller was chairman (or chairman emeritus) of the Capital Analysis Group (CapAnalysis), a division of the international law firm Howrey LLP. Currently, he is a senior advisor to international law firm of Husch Blackwell Sanders (merger dated March 1, 2008)[10] He was a member of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service (2003–2012), where he was elected chairman in 2005, 2006, and 2007.[11]
On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Miller was picked by the then Premier of the Cayman Islands William McKeeva Bush to lead an independent task force to examine new revenue options for the Cayman Islands Government. The Cayman Islands has no direct taxation although that may change as a result of an agreement with the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK FCO allowed the Cayman Islands Government to borrow additional funds to meet capital and operational expenses as long as the Government agreed to look at ways in which to increase and stabilize its revenue base—direct taxation being the preferred solution.

James Clifford "Jim" Miller III (born June 25, 1942, in Atlanta, Georgia) is a former U.S. government official and economist who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission between 1981 and 1985 and as Budget Director for President Ronald Reagan between 1985 and 1988. He also ran for United States Senate in Virginia, losing the Republican nomination at the convention to Oliver North in 1994 and losing the nomination in the primary to John Warner in 1996.[3][4][5]
Biography[edit]
Miller was born in Atlanta and grew up in Conyers, Georgia. He earned a B.B.A. in economics from the University of Georgia in 1964 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Virginia in 1969.
Between 1977 and 1981, Miller was a resident scholar at the Center for the Study of Government Regulation at the American Enterprise Institute. From 1978 to 1981, he served as co-director of the center.
Miller was the first administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (April - October 1981) and the executive director of Vice President George H. W. Bush's Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief. From 1981 to 1985, he chaired the Federal Trade Commission. From October 1985 to October 1988, Miller was director of the United States Office of Management and Budget.
He is a distinguished fellow at the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University.[6] He is also a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[7]
He has been counselor to and a board member of the former Citizens for a Sound Economy[8] (1988–2002), a member of the boards of the Tax Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, and a member of the board of visitors of George Mason University and the U.S. Air Force Academy. In addition, Miller has been a director of LECG Economics-Finance, a member of the board of Independence Air, a member of the board of Washington Mutual Investors Fund, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Maryland, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Virginia, a member of the board of the J.P. Morgan Value Opportunities Fund, a member of the board of Clean Energy, a consultant to Freddie Mac, and chairman of the board of Economic Impact Analysts, Inc. (family-held consulting firm).[9]
From 2003 to 2006, Miller was chairman (or chairman emeritus) of the Capital Analysis Group (CapAnalysis), a division of the international law firm Howrey LLP. Currently, he is a senior advisor to international law firm of Husch Blackwell Sanders (merger dated March 1, 2008)[10] He was a member of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service (2003–2012), where he was elected chairman in 2005, 2006, and 2007.[11]
On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Miller was picked by the then Premier of the Cayman Islands William McKeeva Bush to lead an independent task force to examine new revenue options for the Cayman Islands Government. The Cayman Islands has no direct taxation although that may change as a result of an agreement with the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK FCO allowed the Cayman Islands Government to borrow additional funds to meet capital and operational expenses as long as the Government agreed to look at ways in which to increase and stabilize its revenue base—direct taxation being the preferred solution.

                                In 1996, once again Miller was a candidate for
                                the Republican nomination to the U.S. Senate,
                                losing to incumbent Sen. John Warner in the June
                                primary. In 1998, he was treasurer of his wife’s
                                campaign to represent Virginia’s Eighth

                                with another (losing) run for the same office in

James Clifford "Jim" Miller III (born June 25, 1942, in Atlanta, Georgia) is a former U.S. government official and economist who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission between 1981 and 1985 and as Budget Director for President Ronald Reagan between 1985 and 1988. He also ran for United States Senate in Virginia, losing the Republican nomination at the convention to Oliver North in 1994 and losing the nomination in the primary to John Warner in 1996.[3][4][5]
Biography[edit]
Miller was born in Atlanta and grew up in Conyers, Georgia. He earned a B.B.A. in economics from the University of Georgia in 1964 and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Virginia in 1969.
Between 1977 and 1981, Miller was a resident scholar at the Center for the Study of Government Regulation at the American Enterprise Institute. From 1978 to 1981, he served as co-director of the center.
Miller was the first administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (April - October 1981) and the executive director of Vice President George H. W. Bush's Presidential Task Force on Regulatory Relief. From 1981 to 1985, he chaired the Federal Trade Commission. From October 1985 to October 1988, Miller was director of the United States Office of Management and Budget.
He is a distinguished fellow at the Center for Study of Public Choice at George Mason University.[6] He is also a senior fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.[7]
He has been counselor to and a board member of the former Citizens for a Sound Economy[8] (1988–2002), a member of the boards of the Tax Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, and a member of the board of visitors of George Mason University and the U.S. Air Force Academy. In addition, Miller has been a director of LECG Economics-Finance, a member of the board of Independence Air, a member of the board of Washington Mutual Investors Fund, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Maryland, a member of the board of the Tax-Exempt Fund of Virginia, a member of the board of the J.P. Morgan Value Opportunities Fund, a member of the board of Clean Energy, a consultant to Freddie Mac, and chairman of the board of Economic Impact Analysts, Inc. (family-held consulting firm).[9]
From 2003 to 2006, Miller was chairman (or chairman emeritus) of the Capital Analysis Group (CapAnalysis), a division of the international law firm Howrey LLP. Currently, he is a senior advisor to international law firm of Husch Blackwell Sanders (merger dated March 1, 2008)[10] He was a member of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service (2003–2012), where he was elected chairman in 2005, 2006, and 2007.[11]
On November 9, 2009, it was announced that Miller was picked by the then Premier of the Cayman Islands William McKeeva Bush to lead an independent task force to examine new revenue options for the Cayman Islands Government. The Cayman Islands has no direct taxation although that may change as a result of an agreement with the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The UK FCO allowed the Cayman Islands Government to borrow additional funds to meet capital and operational expenses as long as the Government agreed to look at ways in which to increase and stabilize its revenue base—direct taxation being the preferred solution.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
