Warning: Fraudulent Job Postings and Offers
There have been a number of fraudulently issued checks bearing the name "Bahnson Mechanical Systems" or "Bahnson Mechan Systems". These checks have been accompanied by a notification that recipients are winners of a "Supermarket Customer Sweepstakes Raffle Draw" and require a "processing fee" in order to claim their winnings. These checks and notices were not issued by Bahnson and are fraudulent.
Should you receive such a check and/or request for a processing fee, you should NOT participate in the process.
If you have already participated in the process, you should notify the appropriate authorities of this fraudulent activity.

EMCOR Group, Inc. does not do business in the Middle East and India.  Unfortunately, individuals have been fraudulently representing themselves as EMCOR Group, Inc. by creating forms, posting jobs, making job offers, and requesting personal information of individuals, using email addresses which include emcorgroupinc@usa.com, info.emcorgroupinc@yandex.com, emcorgroupinc@outlook.com, and admin@emcorgroupinc.org.  Please do not send any information to such email addresses. In addition, please do not apply to any jobs at "EMCOR Group" to the extent listed as being outside of the U.S. or UK as they are likely fraudulent postings.
Also Please Note: Fraudulent emails are being circulated from various email addresses, and which ask people to click on links and respond to various email addresses. These emails invite people to continue with "the next step of the hiring process, which is a telephone interview."

Manufacturing & Construction Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
The Manufacturing sector covers work performed in mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products. The assembling of component parts of manufactured products also falls under Manufacturing unless the activity is appropriately classified in Construction.
The Construction sector primarily covers work performed in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems). 
	 Companies that perform work in the preparation of sites for new construction and those involved subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in Construction.

Manufacturing uses raw materials that are products of agriculture, fishing, forestry, mining, or quarrying, as well as products of other manufacturing operations. Plants, factories, or mills that characteristically use power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment, transform the raw materials into new finished products or components of products that require further manufacturing.

Construction markets include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. Activities of these enterprises generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites. Production responsibilities are specified contractually with construction project owners (prime contractors) or contracts with other construction companies (subcontractors).

Construction companies that contract responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but are also markets known as design-build, construction management, turnkey contracting, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contracting. Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as

A provider of critical infrastructure systems, EMCOR gives life to new structures and sustains life in existing ones by planning, installing, operating, maintaining, and protecting the sophisticated and dynamic systems that create facility environments—such as electrical, mechanical, lighting, air conditioning, heating, security, fire protection, and power generation systems—in virtually every sector of the economy and for a diverse range of businesses, organizations, and government.   EMCOR represents a rare combination of broad reach with local execution, combining the strength of an industry leader with the knowledge and care of 170 locations.   The approximately 33,000 skilled employees of EMCOR have made the company, in the eyes of leading business publications, amongst the “World’s Most Admired” and “Best Managed.” EMCOR’s diversity—in terms of the services it provides, the industries it serves, and the geography it spans—has enabled it to create a stable platform for sustained results.   The Company’s strong financial position has enabled it to attract and retain among the best local and regional talent, to undertake and complete the most ambitious projects, and to redefine and shape the future of the construction and facilities services industry.  

The crew at Bahnson Environmental Specialties installed this ultra low temp (-80°C) walk-in freezer chamber for a pharmaceutical client. Employees from Intermech excavated this area and are now lowering a floor drain tank for this water solidification building.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Warning: Fraudulent Job Postings and Offers
There have been a number of fraudulently issued checks bearing the name "Bahnson Mechanical Systems" or "Bahnson Mechan Systems". These checks have been accompanied by a notification that recipients are winners of a "Supermarket Customer Sweepstakes Raffle Draw" and require a "processing fee" in order to claim their winnings. These checks and notices were not issued by Bahnson and are fraudulent.
Should you receive such a check and/or request for a processing fee, you should NOT participate in the process.
If you have already participated in the process, you should notify the appropriate authorities of this fraudulent activity.

EMCOR Group, Inc. does not do business in the Middle East and India.  Unfortunately, individuals have been fraudulently representing themselves as EMCOR Group, Inc. by creating forms, posting jobs, making job offers, and requesting personal information of individuals, using email addresses which include emcorgroupinc@usa.com, info.emcorgroupinc@yandex.com, emcorgroupinc@outlook.com, and admin@emcorgroupinc.org.  Please do not send any information to such email addresses. In addition, please do not apply to any jobs at "EMCOR Group" to the extent listed as being outside of the U.S. or UK as they are likely fraudulent postings.
Also Please Note: Fraudulent emails are being circulated from various email addresses, and which ask people to click on links and respond to various email addresses. These emails invite people to continue with "the next step of the hiring process, which is a telephone interview."
