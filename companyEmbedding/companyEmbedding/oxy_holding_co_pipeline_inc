  "This sale allows us to monetize this important pipeline while retaining        long-term cost-advantaged shipping commitments on BridgeTex to ensure        access to the key Houston refining markets" 



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Occidental 
      Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) today announced the entrance into 
      an agreement with Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA) and Plains GP 
      Holdings, L.P. (PAGP) to sell its 50 percent interest in BridgeTex 
      Pipeline Company, LLC (BridgeTex) to PAA for $1.075 billion.
    

      BridgeTex, a company jointly owned by Occidental and Magellan Midstream 
      Partners, L.P., owns the BridgeTex Pipeline, a 300,000 barrel-per-day 
      crude oil pipeline extending from the Permian Basin to the Houston Gulf 
      Coast area. The BridgeTex Pipeline began service in September 2014.
    

      The sale of Occidental’s interest in BridgeTex includes two 
      transactions: PAA will purchase for $1.075 billion Occidental’s interest 
      in the approximately 400-mile northern leg of the BridgeTex pipeline 
      which runs from the Permian Basin to East Houston; and Magellan will 
      acquire Occidental’s interest in the approximately 40-mile, 24-inch 
      southern leg of the BridgeTex pipeline from Houston to Texas City for 
      $75 million.
    

      "This sale allows us to monetize this important pipeline while retaining 
      long-term cost-advantaged shipping commitments on BridgeTex to ensure 
      access to the key Houston refining markets," said Stephen I. Chazen, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer. “This is in line with our 
      previously announced strategic review to streamline our business, 
      reinvest in areas where we have depth and scale, and maximize total 
      return to shareholders.”
    

      The BridgeTex transaction is contingent on the sale of a portion of 
      Occidental’s Class A shares in PAGP.
