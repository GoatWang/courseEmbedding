FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

(photo_of_Edward_C_Johnson_3d)                                                  
DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Through the first five months of 1997, stock and bond markets experienced       
the kind of short-term volatility that can affect them from time to time.       
After climbing steadily upward for more than two years, stock prices saw a      
sharp correction in late March and early April. Returns in the bond market      
were essentially stagnant as the Federal Reserve Board implemented a            
long-expected increase in short-term interest rates at the end of March.        
While it's impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with       
any degree of certainty, there are certain basic principles that can help       
investors plan for their future needs.                                          
First, investors are encouraged to take a long-term view of their               
portfolios. If you can afford to leave your money invested through the          
inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets, you will greatly        
reduce your vulnerability to any single decline. We know from experience,       
for example, that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time,        
have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed      
ahead of inflation.                                                             
Second, you can further manage your investing risk through diversification.     
A stock mutual fund, for instance, is already diversified, because it           
invests in many different companies. You can increase your diversification      
further by investing in a number of different stock funds, or in such other     
investment categories as bonds. If you have a short investment time             
horizon, you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a       
money market fund, which seeks income and a stable share price by investing     
in high-quality, short-term investments. Of course, it's important to           
remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve       
its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share, and        
that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency      
of the U.S. government.                                                         
Finally, no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity, it makes      
good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing a certain amount      
of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically      
reviewing your overall portfolio. By doing so, you won't get caught up in       
the excitement of a rapidly rising market, nor will you buy all your shares     
at market highs. While this strategy - known as dollar cost averaging -         
won't assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market, it      
should help you lower the average cost of your purchases.                       
Remember to contact your investment professional if you need help with your     
investments.                                                                    
Best regards,                                                                   
Edward C. Johnson 3d                                                            
ADVISOR EQUITY INCOME FUND - CLASS A                                            
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate historical performance. You can look at      
the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change      
or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects       
the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the          
class' dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale      
of securities that have grown in value).                                        
The initial offering of Class A shares took place on September 3, 1996.         
Class A shares bear a 0.25% 12b-1 fee that is reflected in returns after        
September 3, 1996. Returns between September 10, 1992 (the date Class T         
shares were first offered) and September 3, 1996 are those of Class T and       
reflect Class T's 0.50% 12b-1 fee (0.65% prior to January 1, 1996). Returns     
prior to September 10, 1992 are those of the Institutional Class, the           
original class of the fund. Had Class A's 12b-1 fee been reflected, returns     
prior to September 10, 1992 would have been lower. If Fidelity had not          
reimbursed certain class expenses, the total returns would have been lower.     
CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS

Equity Income Funds Average             10.11%   22.43%   102.02%   209.24%     

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show Class A's performance in percentage terms         
over a set period - in this case, six months, one year, five years or 10        
years. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5%          
return, over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050.       
You can compare Class A's returns to the performance of the Standard &          
Poor's 500 Index - a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stocks.       
To measure how Class A's performance stacked up against its peers, you can      
compare it to the equity income funds average, which reflects the               
performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper           
Analytical Services, Inc. The past six months average represents a peer         
group of 185 mutual funds. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends        
and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

$10,000 OVER 10 YEARS:  Let's say hypothetically that $10,000 was invested      
in Fidelity Advisor Equity Income Fund - Class A on May 31, 1987, and the       
current maximum 5.25% sales charge was paid. As the chart shows, by May 31,
1997, the value of the investment would have grown to $32,052 - a 220.52%       
increase on the initial investment. For comparison, look at how the S&P 500     
did over the same period. With dividends reinvested, the same $10,000           
investment would have grown to $39,484 - a 294.84% increase.

no guarantee of how it will do                                                  
tomorrow. The stock market,                                                     
for example, has a history of                                                   
long-term growth and

ADVISOR EQUITY INCOME FUND - CLASS T                                            
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate historical performance. You can look at      
the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change      
or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects       
the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the          
class' dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale      
of securities that have grown in value).                                        
The initial offering of Class T shares took place on September 10, 1992.        
Class T shares bear a 0.50% 12b-1 fee (0.65% prior to January 1, 1996) that     
is reflected in returns after September 10, 1992. Returns prior to that         
date are those of the Institutional Class, the original class of the fund.      
Had Class T's 12b-1 fee been reflected, returns prior to September 10, 1992     
would have been lower. If Fidelity had not reimbursed certain class             
expenses, the past five and past 10 year total returns would have been          
lower.

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show Class T's performance in percentage terms         
over a set period - in this case, six months, one year, five years or 10        
years. For example, if you invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5% return,      
over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050. You can       
compare Class T's returns to the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500       
Index - a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stocks. To measure       
how Class T's performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it      
to the equity income funds average, which reflects the performance of           
mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper Analytical Services,     
Inc. The past six months average represents a peer group of 185 mutual          
funds. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if      
any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

$10,000 OVER 10 YEARS:  Let's say hypothetically that $10,000 was invested      
in Fidelity Advisor Equity Income Fund - Class T on May 31, 1987, and the       
current maximum 3.50% sales charge was paid. As the chart shows, by May 31,
1997, the value of the investment would have grown to $32,697 - a 226.97%       
increase on the initial investment. For comparison, look at how the S&P 500     
did over the same period. With dividends reinvested, the same $10,000           
investment would have grown to $39,484 - a 294.84% increase.

no guarantee of how it will do

for example, has a history of                                                   
long-term growth and

lose money. But if you can                                                      
ride out the market's ups and

ADVISOR EQUITY INCOME FUND - CLASS B                                            
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate historical performance. You can look at      
the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change,     
or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects       
the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the          
class' dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale      
of securities that have grown in value).                                        
Initial offering of Class B shares took place on June 30, 1994. Class B         
shares bear a 1.00% 12b-1/shareholder service fee that is reflected in          
returns after June 30, 1994. Returns between September 10, 1992 (the date       
Class T shares were first offered) and June 30, 1994 are those of Class T,      
and reflect Class T's prior 0.65% 12b-1 fee. Returns prior to September 10,
1992 are those of the Institutional Class, the original class of the fund.      
Had Class B's 12b-1 fee been reflected, returns prior to June 30, 1994          
would have been lower. Effective January 2, 1997, Class B's contingent          
deferred sales charge is based on a declining scale that ranges from 5% to      
1% on Class B shares redeemed within six years of purchase. This scale is       
revised from the previous scale of 4% to 1% on shares redeemed within five      
years of purchase. Class B's contingent deferred sales charge included in       
the past six months, past one year, past five years, and past 10 years          
total return figures are 5%, 5%, 2% and 0%, respectively. If Fidelity had       
not reimbursed certain class expenses, the past five and past 10 year total     
returns would have been lower.

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show Class B's performance in percentage terms         
over a set period - in this case six months, one year, five years or 10         
years. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund that had a 5%          
return, over the past year, the value of your investment would be $1,050.       
You can compare Class B's returns to the performance of the Standard &          
Poor's 500 Index - a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stocks.       
To measure how Class B's performance stacked up against its peers, you can      
compare it to the equity income funds average, which reflects the               
performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by Lipper           
Analytical Services, Inc. The past six months average represents a peer         
group of 185 mutual funds. These benchmarks include reinvested dividends        
and capital gains, if any, and exclude the effect of sales charges.

$10,000 OVER 10 YEARS:  Let's say hypothetically that $10,000 was invested      
in Fidelity Advisor Equity Income Fund - Class B on May 31, 1987. As the        
chart shows, by May 31, 1997, the value of the investment, would have been      
$33,471 - a 234.71% increase on the initial investment. For comparison,         
look at how the S&P 500 did over the same period. With dividends                
reinvested, the same $10,000 investment would have grown to $39,484 - a         
294.84% increase.

How a fund did yesterday is                                                     
no guarantee of how it will do                                                  
tomorrow. The stock market,                                                     
for example, has a history of                                                   
long-term growth and

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW                                               

An interview with Robert Chow, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Advisor Equity     
Income Fund                                                                     
Q. BOB, HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?                                               
A. For the six months ending May 31, 1997, the fund's Class A, Class T and      
Class B shares returned 9.02%, 9.11% and 8.91%, respectively. For the past      
year, the Class A, Class T and Class B shares returned 19.51%, 19.70% and       
19.13%, respectively. The fund trailed the equity income funds average for      
the same time periods, as tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, which was      
up 10.11% for six months and 22.43% for the year. Additionally, the             
Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 13.15% for six months and 29.42% for the     
year.                                                                           
Q. WHY DID THE FUND UNDERPERFORM THE INDEX?                                     
A. Over the period, the fund's cash position was fairly high - between 8%       
and 10% of assets - which hurt returns since the fund wasn't fully invested     
in a rising market. The large cash position was mostly the result of            
dramatic inflows of capital into the fund, especially this past January.        
Following that inflow, I made the decision to invest a portion of the           
proceeds in S&P 500 futures. I saw these low-risk futures not as a market       
bet, but as a place to get some market exposure on a temporary basis. My        
goal going forward is to eliminate this position entirely. I should point       
out that I am a value investor, and I look hard at whether a stock is           
attractive on a valuation basis; that is, whether it's cheap or expensive       
relative to its own history, similar companies or its underlying assets. I      
also invest for the long term. As a result, I tend to be cautious when the      
fund has large inflows of cash. I'm not just going to throw this capital        
into equities; instead I'll wait to find value stocks with the potential        
for long-term success.                                                          
Q. WERE THERE ANY OTHER REASONS BEHIND THE FUND'S UNDERPERFORMANCE COMPARED     
TO THE INDEX OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS?                                          
A. Yes. The fund underperformed the index because the index held more           
large-capitalization companies, which the market favored over the period,       
than the fund held. I found value mostly in mid-cap stocks, although I did      
hold a number of large-cap stocks in my top 10 positions. In addition, the      
fund was hurt by holding fewer bank stocks than the average equity-income       
fund. Banks did very well over the period, especially in January of 1997.       
The fund's fairly large sector weighting in finance at the end of the           
period - 18% - mostly represented its investments in non-banks, such as         
insurance companies.                                                            
Q. WHAT WERE SOME INVESTMENT DECISIONS THAT PAID OFF FOR THE FUND OVER THE      
PERIOD?                                                                         
A. Probably the fund's best-performing holdings were Wal-Mart and IBM,          
which both turned in strong results over the period. Wal-Mart, one of the       
fund's top holdings during the period, was perhaps my favorite. About three     
or four years ago, it embarked on a strategy of converting its existing         
stores into superstores, which have just about everything a consumer would      
want to buy, including groceries. This strategy set Wal-Mart up for future      
profits, but was very expensive in the short run since it costs a               
tremendous amount to convert stores. I invested in Wal-Mart early on in         
this strategy, and this year that investment started paying off as these        
superstores continued to mature.                                                
Q. WHAT ABOUT IBM?                                                              
A. Top 10 stock IBM was another solid holding. New management has come in       
and helped generate tremendous cash flow, which has been used in part to        
repurchase one in every seven shares outstanding. I got into IBM very early     
in this process when its stock was inexpensive and my research showed that      
there was a favorable risk/reward ratio. This meant that the potential          
downside of the stock was much lower than the potential upside.                 
Q. YOU NOTED EARLIER THAT YOU ARE A VALUE INVESTOR. WERE THERE SOME STOCKS      
THAT YOU CONSIDERED REAL VALUE STOCKS OVER THE PERIOD?                          
A. Yes. Clearly, I thought Wal-Mart and IBM were value stocks. Another good     
example was top 10 holding Philip Morris. Philip Morris did very well and       
had steady earnings and cash flow over the period. The problem is that it's     
a tobacco company facing litigation. This kept its valuation low. When you      
buy a well-established Fortune 500 stock at this value price, you know          
there's some risk involved. However, my research showed me that the stock's     
potential reward was higher than its potential risk, so the risk/reward         
ratio was still good. Another value company was Masco, which makes faucets      
and kitchen cabinets. It has been undervalued due to some past strategy         
errors, but its core business has been profitable throughout recent             
history. In addition, the chairman, who is paid a cash salary of only $1 a      
year but has a stock option for a million shares if he reaches the              
company's goals, has a strong incentive to profitably grow the company.         
Q. DID YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS OVER THE PERIOD?                                    
A. Sure. As I mentioned earlier, I wish I had invested less of the fund in      
cash over the period. I am actively working to minimize or reduce this          
position.                                                                       
Q. BOB, HOW DOES THE FUND LOOK GOING FORWARD?                                   
A. I am positioning the fund to provide reasonable returns with low             
volatility and risk. Going forward, I have some concerns because valuation      
levels look quite high, so I expect that there will be fewer positive           
risk/reward opportunities available. However, if the economy continues on       
its steady path of slow, moderate growth, I think the overall market            
outlook is pretty bright.

BOB CHOW ON THE GOALS OF THE                                                    
FUND:                                                                           
"The goal of the fund is                                                        
long-term capital                                                               
appreciation achieved in a                                                      
context of low risk. This                                                       
entails several things, such as                                                 
low volatility and low fund                                                     
turnover. The fund's average                                                    
holding time is three years,                                                    
which is very consistent with                                                   
my long-term investment                                                         
approach.                                                                       
"Part of the way I work toward                                                  
the fund's goals is to strongly                                                 
consider the risk/ reward                                                       
ratio, which I've discussed in                                                  
this report. In fact, the first                                                 
question I ask when I'm                                                         
considering a stock is `What's                                                  
the downside?' After I've                                                       
determined the downside, I                                                      
need to make sure the reward                                                    
is higher.                                                                      
"This fund is not trying to                                                     
catch a fast bang from the                                                      
market, but is positioned for

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
Fidelity Advisor Equity Income Fund(the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Advisor     
Series III (the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of        
shares. The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,       
as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company         
organized as a Massachusetts business trust.                                    
The fund offers Class A, Class T, Class B, and Institutional Class shares,      
each of which has equal rights as to assets and voting privileges. Each         
class has exclusive voting rights with respect to its distribution plan.        
Investment income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, the        
common expenses of the fund, and certain fund-level expense reductions are      
allocated on a pro rata basis to each class based on the relative net           
assets of each class to the total net assets of the fund. Each class of         
shares differs in its respective distribution, transfer agent,                  
registration, and certain other class-specific fees, expenses, and expense      
reductions.                                                                     
The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally        
accepted accounting principles which permit management to make certain          
estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The          
following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund:           
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are readily        
available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale price, at the        
closing bid price. Securities (including restricted securities) for which       
exchange quotations are not readily available (and in certain cases debt        
securities which trade on an exchange) are valued primarily using               
dealer-supplied valuations or at their fair value as determined in good         
faith under consistently applied procedures under the general supervision       
of the Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities       
of sixty days or less for which quotations are not readily available are        
valued at amortized cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of        
which approximate current value.                                                
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and          
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period end. Income receipts      
and expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing         
exchange rate on the respective dates of the transactions. Purchases and        
sales of securities are translated into U.S. dollars at the contractual         
currency exchange rates established at the time of each trade.                  
Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent        
net gains and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency              
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, and the difference between        
the amount of net investment income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount          
actually received. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange          
rates on investments in securities are included with the net realized and       
unrealized gain or loss on investment securities.                               
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                  
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to      
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for      
its fiscal year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding     
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."                        
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date,         
except certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date     
may have passed, are recorded as soon as the fund is informed of the            
ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any,       
are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest      
income, which includes accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as      
earned. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where       
recovery of such taxes is uncertain.                                            
PREPAID EXPENSES. Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) bears all        
organizational expenses except for registering and qualifying Class A and       
shares of Class A for distribution under federal and state securities law.      
These expenses are borne by Class A and amortized over one year.                
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gain distributions are           
declared separately for each class.                                             
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles. These differences, which may result in distribution                 
reclassifications, are primarily due to differing treatments for litigation     
proceeds, market discount, non-taxable dividends and losses deferred due to     
wash sales and excise tax regulations. The fund also utilized earnings and      
profits distributed to shareholders on redemption of shares as a part of        
the dividends paid deduction for income tax purposes.                           
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.              
Undistributed net investment income and accumulated undistributed net           
realized gain (loss) on investments and foreign currency transactions may       
include temporary book and tax basis differences which will reverse in a        
subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end      
is distributed in the following year.                                           
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
2. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                          
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS. The fund generally uses foreign currency            
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated securities.         
Losses may arise from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if        
the counterparties do not perform under the

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS - CONTINUED                                          
contracts' terms. The U.S. dollar value of foreign currency contracts is        
determined using contractual currency exchange rates established at the         
time of each trade. The cost of the foreign currency contracts is included      
in the cost basis of the associated investment.                                 
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission(the SEC), the fund, along with other         
affiliated entities of FMR, may transfer uninvested cash balances into one      
or more joint trading accounts. These balances are invested in one or more      
repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.          
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency           
securities are transferred to an account of the fund, or to the Joint           
Trading Account, at a bank custodian. The securities are marked-to-market       
daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the principal amount of       
the repurchase agreement (including accrued interest). FMR, the fund's          
investment adviser, is responsible for determining that the value of the        
underlying securities remains in accordance with the market value               
requirements stated above.                                                      
TAXABLE CENTRAL CASH FUND. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the         
SEC, the fund may invest in the Taxable Central Cash Fund (the Cash Fund)       
managed by FMR Texas, an affiliate of FMR. The Cash Fund is an open-end         
money market fund available only to investment companies and other accounts     
managed by FMR and its affiliates. The Cash Fund seeks preservation of          
capital, liquidity, and current income by investing in U.S. Treasury            
securities and repurchase agreements for these securities. Income               
distributions from the Cash Fund are declared daily and paid monthly from       
net interest income. Income distributions received by the fund are recorded     
as interest income in the accompanying financial statements.                    
FUTURES CONTRACTS. The fund may use futures contracts to manage its             
exposure to the stock market and to fluctuations in currency values. Buying     
futures tends to increase the fund's exposure to the underlying instrument,     
while selling futures tends to decrease the fund's exposure to the              
underlying instrument or hedge other fund investments. Futures contracts        
involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the futures              
variation margin reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The      
underlying face amount at value of any open futures contracts at period end     
is shown in the schedule of investments under the caption "Futures              
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the underlying     
instrument at period end. Losses may arise from changes in the value of the     
underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for the        
contracts, or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'         
terms. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established         
each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.            
2. OPERATING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                               
RESTRICTED SECURITIES. The fund is permitted to invest in securities that       
are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These               
securities generally may be resold in transactions exempt from registration     
or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these            
securities may involve time-consuming negotiations and expense, and prompt      
sale at an acceptable price may be difficult. At the end of the period, the     
fund had no investments in restricted securities (excluding 144A issues).       
3. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                          
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $809,091,000 and $595,045,000, respectively, of which U.S.           
government and government agency obligations aggregated $3,171,000 and $0,      
respectively.                                                                   
The market value of futures contracts opened and closed during the period       
amounted to $471,796,000 and $403,724,000, respectively.                        
4. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                 
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR receives a fee that       
is computed daily at an annual rate of .50% of the fund's average net           
assets.                                                                         
DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN. In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940        
Act, the Trustees have adopted separate distribution plans with respect to      
each class of shares (collectively referred to as "the Plans"). Under           
certain of the Plans, the class pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation

Under the Plans, FMR or FDC may use its resources to pay administrative and     
promotional expenses related to the sale of each class' shares. The Plans       
also authorize payments to third parties that assist in the sale of each        
class' shares or render shareholder support services.                           
SALES LOAD. FDC receives a front-end sales charge of up to 5.25% for            
selling Class A shares and 3.50% for selling Class T shares of the fund,        
respectively, and the proceeds of a contingent deferred sales charge levied     
on Class B share redemptions occurring within six years of purchase (five       
years prior to January 2, 1997). The Class B charge is based on declining       
rates which range from 5% to 1%(4% to 1% prior to January 2, 1997) of the       
lesser of the cost of shares at the initial date of purchase or the net         
asset value of the redeemed shares, excluding any reinvested dividends and      
capital gains.

5. EXPENSE REDUCTIONS.                                                          
FMR voluntarily agreed to reimburse certain transfer agent, registration        
and other class specific expenses for Class A. For the period, the              
reimbursement reduced these expenses by $8,000.                                 
FMR has also directed certain portfolio trades to brokers who paid a

applicable class' expenses were reduced as follows under the transfer agent     
arrangements:

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:                                                               
Through the first five months of 1997, stock and bond markets experienced       
the kind of short-term volatility that can affect them from time to time.       
After climbing steadily upward for more than two years, stock prices saw a      
sharp correction in late March and early April. Returns in the bond market      
were essentially stagnant as the Federal Reserve Board implemented a            
long-expected increase in short-term interest rates at the end of March.        
While it's impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with       
any degree of certainty, there are certain basic principles that can help       
investors plan for their future needs.                                          
First, investors are encouraged to take a long-term view of their               
portfolios. If you can afford to leave your money invested through the          
inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets, you will greatly        
reduce your vulnerability to any single decline. We know from experience,       
for example, that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time,        
have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed      
ahead of inflation.                                                             
Second, you can further manage your investing risk through diversification.     
A stock mutual fund, for instance, is already diversified, because it           
invests in many different companies. You can increase your diversification      
further by investing in a number of different stock funds, or in such other     
investment categories as bonds. If you have a short investment time             
horizon, you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a       
money market fund, which seeks income and a stable share price by investing     
in high-quality, short-term investments. Of course, it's important to           
remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve       
its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of $1.00 per share, and        
that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency      
of the U.S. government.                                                         
Finally, no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity, it makes      
good sense to follow a regular investment plan, investing a certain amount      
of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically      
reviewing your overall portfolio. By doing so, you won't get caught up in       
the excitement of a rapidly rising market, nor will you buy all your shares     
at market highs. While this strategy - known as dollar cost averaging -         
won't assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market, it      
should help you lower the average cost of your purchases.                       
Remember to contact your investment professional if you need help with your     
investments.                                                                    
Best regards,

ADVISOR EQUITY INCOME FUND - INSTITUTIONAL CLASS                                
PERFORMANCE: THE BOTTOM LINE                                                    

There are several ways to evaluate historical performance. You can look at      
the total percentage change in value, the average annual percentage change      
or the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 investment. Total return reflects       
the change in the value of an investment, assuming reinvestment of the          
class' dividend income and capital gains (the profits earned upon the sale      
of securities that have grown in value). If Fidelity had not reimbursed         
certain class expenses, the past five and 10 year total returns would have      
been lower.                                                                     
CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS

CUMULATIVE TOTAL RETURNS show Institutional Class' performance in               
percentage terms over a set period - in this case, six months, one year,        
five years, or 10 years. For example, if you had invested $1,000 in a fund      
that had a 5% return over the past year, the value of your investment would     
be $1,050. You can compare the Institutional Class' returns to the              
performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index - a widely recognized,           
unmanaged index of common stocks. To measure how Institutional Class'           
performance stacked up against its peers, you can compare it to the equity      
income funds average, which reflects the performance of mutual funds with       
similar objectives tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. The past six     
months average represents a peer group of 185 mutual funds. These               
benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and          
exclude the effect of sales charges.

$10,000 OVER 10 YEARS:  Let's say hypothetically that $10,000 was invested      
in Fidelity Advisor Equity Income Fund - Institutional Class on May 31,         
1987. As the chart shows, by May 31, 1997, the value of the investment          
would have grown to $35,057 - a 250.57% increase on the initial investment.     
For comparison, look at how the S&P 500 did over the same period. With          
dividends reinvested, the same $10,000 investment would have grown to           
$39,484 - a 294.84% increase.

How a fund did yesterday is                                                     
no guarantee of how it will do                                                  
tomorrow. The stock market,                                                     
for example, has a history of                                                   
long-term growth and                                                            
short-term volatility. In turn,                                                 
the share price and return of                                                   
a fund that invests in stocks                                                   
will vary. That means if you                                                    
sell your shares during a                                                       
market downturn, you might                                                      
lose money. But if you can                                                      
ride out the market's ups and

FUND TALK: THE MANAGER'S OVERVIEW                                               

An interview with Robert Chow, Portfolio Manager of Fidelity Advisor Equity     
Income Fund                                                                     
Q. BOB, HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?                                               
A. For the six- month and one-year periods ending May 31, 1997, the fund's      
Institutional Class shares returned 9.47% and 20.41%, respectively. For the     
same time periods, the equity income funds average, as tracked by Lipper        
Analytical Services, was 10.11% and 22.43%. Additionally, the Standard &        
Poor's 500 Index was up 13.15% for six months and 29.42% for the year.          
Q. WHY DID THE FUND UNDERPERFORM THE INDEX?                                     
A. Over the period, the fund's cash position was fairly high - between 8%       
and 10% of assets - which hurt returns since the fund wasn't fully invested     
in a rising market. The large cash position was mostly the result of            
dramatic inflows of capital into the fund, especially this past January.        
Following that inflow, I made the decision to invest a portion of the           
proceeds in S&P 500 futures. I saw these low-risk futures not as a market       
bet, but as a place to get some market exposure on a temporary basis. My        
goal going forward is to eliminate this position entirely. I should point       
out that I am a value investor, and I look hard at whether a stock is           
attractive on a valuation basis; that is, whether it's cheap or expensive       
relative to its own history, similar companies or its underlying assets. I      
also invest for the long term. As a result, I tend to be cautious when the      
fund has large inflows of cash. I'm not just going to throw this capital        
into equities; instead I'll wait to find value stocks with the potential        
for long-term success.                                                          
Q. WERE THERE ANY OTHER REASONS BEHIND THE FUND'S UNDERPERFORMANCE COMPARED     
TO THE INDEX OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS?                                          
A. Yes. The fund underperformed the index because the index held more           
large-capitalization companies, which the market favored over the period,       
than the fund held. I found value mostly in mid-cap stocks, although I did      
hold a number of large-cap stocks in my top 10 positions. In addition, the      
fund was hurt by holding fewer bank stocks than the average equity-income       
fund. Banks did very well over the period, especially in January of 1997.       
The fund's fairly large sector weighting in finance at the end of the           
period - 18% - mostly represented its investments in non-banks, such as         
insurance companies.                                                            
Q. WHAT WERE SOME INVESTMENT DECISIONS THAT PAID OFF FOR THE FUND OVER THE      
PERIOD?                                                                         
A. Probably the fund's best-performing holdings were Wal-Mart and IBM,          
which both turned in strong results over the period. Wal-Mart, one of the       
fund's top holdings during the period, was perhaps my favorite. About three     
or four years ago, it embarked on a strategy of converting its existing         
stores into superstores, which have just about everything a consumer would      
want to buy, including groceries. This strategy set Wal-Mart up for future      
profits, but was very expensive in the short run since it costs a               
tremendous amount to convert stores. I invested in Wal-Mart early on in         
this strategy, and this year that investment started paying off as these        
superstores continued to mature.                                                
Q. WHAT ABOUT IBM?                                                              
A. Top 10 stock IBM was another solid holding. New management has come in       
and helped generate tremendous cash flow, which has been used in part to        
repurchase one in every seven shares outstanding. I got into IBM very early     
in this process when its stock was inexpensive and my research showed that      
there was a favorable risk/reward ratio. This meant that the potential          
downside of the stock was much lower than the potential upside.                 
Q. YOU NOTED EARLIER THAT YOU ARE A VALUE INVESTOR. WERE THERE SOME STOCKS      
THAT YOU CONSIDERED REAL VALUE STOCKS OVER THE PERIOD?                          
A. Yes. Clearly, I thought Wal-Mart and IBM were value stocks. Another good     
example was top 10 holding Philip Morris. Philip Morris did very well and       
had steady earnings and cash flow over the period. The problem is that it's     
a tobacco company facing litigation. This kept its valuation low. When you      
buy a well-established Fortune 500 stock at this value price, you know          
there's some risk involved. However, my research showed me that the stock's     
potential reward was higher than its potential risk, so the risk/reward         
ratio was still good. Another value company was Masco, which makes faucets      
and kitchen cabinets. It has been undervalued due to some past strategy         
errors, but its core business has been profitable throughout recent             
history. In addition, the chairman, who is paid a cash salary of only $1 a      
year but has a stock option for a million shares if he reaches the              
company's goals, has a strong incentive to profitably grow the company.         
Q. DID YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS OVER THE PERIOD?                                    
A. Sure. As I mentioned earlier, I wish I had invested less of the fund in      
cash over the period. I am actively working to minimize or reduce this          
position.                                                                       
Q. BOB, HOW DOES THE FUND LOOK GOING FORWARD?                                   
A. I am positioning the fund to provide reasonable returns with low             
volatility and risk. Going forward, I have some concerns because valuation      
levels look quite high, so I expect that there will be fewer positive           
risk/reward opportunities available. However, if the economy continues on       
its steady path of slow, moderate growth, I think the overall market            
outlook is pretty bright.

9. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.                                             
Fidelity Advisor Equity Income Fund(the fund) is a fund of Fidelity Advisor     
Series III (the trust) and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of        
shares. The trust is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,       
as amended (the 1940 Act), as an open-end management investment company         
organized as a Massachusetts business trust.                                    
The fund offers Class A, Class T, Class B, and Institutional Class shares,      
each of which has equal rights as to assets and voting privileges. Each         
class has exclusive voting rights with respect to its distribution plan.        
Investment income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, the        
common expenses of the fund, and certain fund-level expense reductions are      
allocated on a pro rata basis to each class based on the relative net           
assets of each class to the total net assets of the fund. Each class of         
shares differs in its respective distribution, transfer agent,                  
registration, and certain other class-specific fees, expenses, and expense      
reductions.                                                                     
The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally        
accepted accounting principles which permit management to make certain          
estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements. The          
following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund:           
SECURITY VALUATION. Securities for which exchange quotations are readily        
available are valued at the last sale price, or if no sale price, at the        
closing bid price. Securities (including restricted securities) for which       
exchange quotations are not readily available (and in certain cases debt        
securities which trade on an exchange) are valued primarily using               
dealer-supplied valuations or at their fair value as determined in good         
faith under consistently applied procedures under the general supervision       
of the Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities       
of sixty days or less for which quotations are not readily available are        
valued at amortized cost or original cost plus accrued interest, both of        
which approximate current value.                                                
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The accounting records of the fund are            
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and          
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S.          
dollars at the prevailing rates of exchange at period end. Income receipts      
and expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing         
exchange rate on the respective dates of the transactions. Purchases and        
sales of securities are translated into U.S. dollars at the contractual         
currency exchange rates established at the time of each trade.                  
Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent        
net gains and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency              
contracts, disposition of foreign currencies, and the difference between        
the amount of net investment income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount          
actually received. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange          
rates on investments in securities are included with the net realized and       
unrealized gain or loss on investment securities.                               
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                  
INCOME TAXES. As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter      
M of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund is not subject to income taxes to      
the extent that it distributes substantially all of its taxable income for      
its fiscal year. The schedule of investments includes information regarding     
income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information."                        
INVESTMENT INCOME. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date,         
except certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date     
may have passed, are recorded as soon as the fund is informed of the            
ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any,       
are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest      
income, which includes accretion of original issue discount, is accrued as      
earned. Investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where       
recovery of such taxes is uncertain.                                            
PREPAID EXPENSES. Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) bears all        
organizational expenses except for registering and qualifying Class A and       
shares of Class A for distribution under federal and state securities law.      
These expenses are borne by Class A and amortized over one year.                
DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions are recorded on the                
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gain distributions are           
declared separately for each class.                                             
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with         
income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting      
principles. These differences, which may result in distribution                 
reclassifications, are primarily due to differing treatments for litigation     
proceeds, market discount, non-taxable dividends and losses deferred due to     
wash sales and excise tax regulations. The fund also utilized earnings and      
profits distributed to shareholders on redemption of shares as a part of        
the dividends paid deduction for income tax purposes.                           
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder                
distributions will result in reclassifications to paid in capital.              
Undistributed net investment income and accumulated undistributed net           
realized gain (loss) on investments and foreign currency transactions may       
include temporary book and tax basis differences which will reverse in a        
subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining at fiscal year end      
is distributed in the following year.                                           
SECURITY TRANSACTIONS. Security transactions are accounted for as of trade      
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of        
identified cost.                                                                
10. OPERATING POLICIES.                                                         
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS. The fund generally uses foreign currency            
contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign-denominated securities.         
Losses may arise from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if        
the counterparties do not perform under the                                     
2. OPERATING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                               
FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS - CONTINUED                                          
contracts' terms. The U.S. dollar value of foreign currency contracts is        
determined using contractual currency exchange rates established at the         
time of each trade. The cost of the foreign currency contracts is included      
in the cost basis of the associated investment.                                 
JOINT TRADING ACCOUNT. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the             
Securities and Exchange Commission(the SEC), the fund, along with other         
affiliated entities of FMR, may transfer uninvested cash balances into one      
or more joint trading accounts. These balances are invested in one or more      
repurchase agreements for U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency obligations.          
REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The underlying U.S. Treasury or Federal Agency           
securities are transferred to an account of the fund, or to the Joint           
Trading Account, at a bank custodian. The securities are marked-to-market       
daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the principal amount of       
the repurchase agreement (including accrued interest). FMR, the fund's          
investment adviser, is responsible for determining that the value of the        
underlying securities remains in accordance with the market value               
requirements stated above.                                                      
TAXABLE CENTRAL CASH FUND. Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the         
SEC, the fund may invest in the Taxable Central Cash Fund (the Cash Fund)       
managed by FMR Texas, an affiliate of FMR. The Cash Fund is an open-end         
money market fund available only to investment companies and other accounts     
managed by FMR and its affiliates. The Cash Fund seeks preservation of          
capital, liquidity, and current income by investing in U.S. Treasury            
securities and repurchase agreements for these securities. Income               
distributions from the Cash Fund are declared daily and paid monthly from       
net interest income. Income distributions received by the fund are recorded     
as interest income in the accompanying financial statements.                    
FUTURES CONTRACTS. The fund may use futures contracts to manage its             
exposure to the stock market and to fluctuations in currency values. Buying     
futures tends to increase the fund's exposure to the underlying instrument,     
while selling futures tends to decrease the fund's exposure to the              
underlying instrument or hedge other fund investments. Futures contracts        
involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of the futures              
variation margin reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The      
underlying face amount at value of any open futures contracts at period end     
is shown in the schedule of investments under the caption "Futures              
Contracts." This amount reflects each contract's exposure to the underlying     
instrument at period end. Losses may arise from changes in the value of the     
underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary market for the        
contracts, or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts'         
terms. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established         
each day by the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.            
2. OPERATING POLICIES - CONTINUED                                               
RESTRICTED SECURITIES. The fund is permitted to invest in securities that       
are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale. These               
securities generally may be resold in transactions exempt from registration     
or to the public if the securities are registered. Disposal of these            
securities may involve time-consuming negotiations and expense, and prompt      
sale at an acceptable price may be difficult. At the end of the period, the     
fund had no investments in restricted securities (excluding 144A issues).       
11. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.                                         
Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term securities,            
aggregated $809,091,000 and $595,045,000, respectively, of which U.S.           
government and government agency obligations aggregated $3,171,000 and $0,      
respectively.                                                                   
The market value of futures contracts opened and closed during the period       
amounted to $471,796,000 and $403,724,000, respectively.                        
12. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES.                                
MANAGEMENT FEE. As the fund's investment adviser, FMR receives a fee that       
is computed daily at an annual rate of .50% of the fund's average net           
assets.                                                                         
DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN. In accordance with Rule 12b-1 of the 1940        
Act, the Trustees have adopted separate distribution plans with respect to      
each class of shares (collectively referred to as "the Plans"). Under           
certain of the Plans, the class pays Fidelity Distributors Corporation          
(FDC), an affiliate of FMR, a distribution and service fee. This fee is         
based on the following annual rates of the average net assets of each           
applicable class:                                                               
CLASS A     .25%                                                                
CLASS T     .50%

For the period, each class paid FDC the following amounts, a portion of         
which was paid to securities dealers, banks and other financial                 
institutions for the distribution of each class' applicable shares, and

DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN - CONTINUED                                       
Under the Plans, FMR or FDC may use its resources to pay administrative and     
promotional expenses related to the sale of each class' shares. The Plans       
also authorize payments to third parties that assist in the sale of each        
class' shares or render shareholder support services.                           
SALES LOAD. FDC receives a front-end sales charge of up to 5.25% for            
selling Class A shares and 3.50% for selling Class T shares of the fund,        
respectively, and the proceeds of a contingent deferred sales charge levied     
on Class B share redemptions occurring within six years of purchase (five       
years prior to January 2, 1997). The Class B charge is based on declining       
rates which range from 5% to 1%(4% to 1% prior to January 2, 1997) of the       
lesser of the cost of shares at the initial date of purchase or the net         
asset value of the redeemed shares, excluding any reinvested dividends and      
capital gains.                                                                  
For the period, FDC received the following sales charge amounts related to      
each class, a portion of which is paid to securities, dealers, banks, and       
other financial institutions:

TRANSFER AGENT FEES. Each class of the fund has entered into a separate         
transfer, dividend disbursing, and shareholder servicing agent                  
(collectively referred to as the Transfer Agents) contract with respect to      
its shares. The Transfer Agents receive account fees and asset-based fees       
that vary according to the account size and type of account of the              
shareholders of the respective classes of the fund. For the period, the

and other class specific expenses for Class A. For the period, the              
reimbursement reduced these expenses by $8,000.                                 
FMR has also directed certain portfolio trades to brokers who paid a            
portion of the fund's expenses. For the period, the fund's expenses were        
reduced by $163,000 under this arrangement.                                     
In addition, the fund has entered into an arrangement with each class'          
transfer agent whereby credits realized as a result of uninvested cash          
balances were used to reduce a portion of expenses. During the period, each     
applicable class' expenses were reduced as follows under the transfer agent     
arrangements:
