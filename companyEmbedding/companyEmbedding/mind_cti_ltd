History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.
Auction Rate Securities[edit]
Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]
Suit by Mind CTI Ltd. against its accountant, Kesselmann and Kesselmann[edit]
In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.[19]
Dividend[edit]
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year (once a year, a cash dividend will be distributed, subject to review and approval by the company's board of directors, and the dividend amount will be equal to the company's EBITDA plus financial income (expenses) minus taxes on income.)
From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:

On November 3, 2014, the company announced that the 2015 dividend payment would not require court approval since the company's retained earnings would be adequate relative to the dividend.[22] In February 2015, the company announced that the 2015 dividend would be $0.30 per share.[23]

History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.
Auction Rate Securities[edit]
Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]
Suit by Mind CTI Ltd. against its accountant, Kesselmann and Kesselmann[edit]
In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.[19]
Dividend[edit]
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year (once a year, a cash dividend will be distributed, subject to review and approval by the company's board of directors, and the dividend amount will be equal to the company's EBITDA plus financial income (expenses) minus taxes on income.)
From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:

History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.
Auction Rate Securities[edit]
Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]
Suit by Mind CTI Ltd. against its accountant, Kesselmann and Kesselmann[edit]
In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.[19]
Dividend[edit]
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year (once a year, a cash dividend will be distributed, subject to review and approval by the company's board of directors, and the dividend amount will be equal to the company's EBITDA plus financial income (expenses) minus taxes on income.)
From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:

On November 3, 2014, the company announced that the 2015 dividend payment would not require court approval since the company's retained earnings would be adequate relative to the dividend.[22] In February 2015, the company announced that the 2015 dividend would be $0.30 per share.[23]

History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.
Auction Rate Securities[edit]
Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]
Suit by Mind CTI Ltd. against its accountant, Kesselmann and Kesselmann[edit]
In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.[19]
Dividend[edit]
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year (once a year, a cash dividend will be distributed, subject to review and approval by the company's board of directors, and the dividend amount will be equal to the company's EBITDA plus financial income (expenses) minus taxes on income.)
From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:

0.13


11/07/2003
0.14


Dividends paid to the company's shareholders in 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was US$4.5 million, US$6.0 million, US$3.7 million, and US$14.8 million, respectively.[20][21] From 2003 through 2014, the company has paid out approximately $3.09 per share to its shareholders.[8]
On November 3, 2014, the company announced that the 2015 dividend payment would not require court approval since the company's retained earnings would be adequate relative to the dividend.[22] In February 2015, the company announced that the 2015 dividend would be $0.30 per share.[23]

Press Release – February 23, 2017








MIND CTI Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results


*Board Declares Cash Dividend


Yoqneam, Israel, February 23, 2017 MIND C.T.I. LTD. - (NasdaqGM: MNDO), a leading provider of convergent end-to-end prepaid/postpaid billing and customer care product based solutions for service providers as well as unified communications analytics and call accounting solutions for enterprises, today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016.


The following will summarize our business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and provide a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter and for the full year. The financial results can be found in the Investor Information section of our website at  http://www.mindcti.com/investor-information/ and in our Form 6-K.


Financial Highlights of Q4 2016



Revenues of $4.7 million, compared to $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2015..


Operating income was $1.8 million (including a one-time decrease in provisions), compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.


Net income of $0.9 million or $0.05 per share, compared to $1.1 million or $0.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015.


Cash flow from operating activities was $0.9 million, compared to $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.


Multiple follow-on orders and one extension of a managed services contract.



Financial Highlights of Full Year 2016



Revenues of $18.1 million, down 13% from $20.9 million in 2015.


Operating income was $5.2 million, or 28.8% of revenue, compared to $6.4 million, or 30.6% of revenue, in 2015.


Net income of $4.2 million, or $0.22 per share, compared to $5.0 million or $0.26 per share in 2015.


Cash flow from operating activities was $5.2 million, compared to $6.3 million in 2015.


Cash position of approximately $19.8 million as of December 31, 2016.



As of December 31, 2016 we had 262 employees, compared to 337 as of December 31, 2015.


Monica Iancu, MIND CTI's President and Chief Executive Officer commented: 'In 2016 we successfully implemented new technologies and new methodologies, won two new deals, one of them being significant and we obtained a very high number of follow-on orders. We effectively completed different phases in ongoing deployments. Nowadays, the telecom carriers compete mainly on price. Our customers encounter profitability challenges and continuously aim to reduce both operating and capital expenditures. We believe that our up-to-date, versatile, comprehensive product-based billing platform and agile delivery fit perfectly with multi-play service providers and address their challenge of reducing operational cost. During the last two years we invested significantly in the new version of MINDBill, which will be released this year and we intend to promote the sales of upgrades. We also intend to continue to invest in our cloud solutions and to execute on our long-term targets.'


Revenue Distribution for Q4 2016


Revenues in the Americas represented 63.6%, revenues in Europe represented 22.3% and revenues in Israel represented 5.4% of our total revenues.


Revenues from our customer care and billing software totaled $3.6 million, or 77% of total revenues, while revenues from our enterprise call accounting software were $1.1 million, or 23% of total revenues.


Revenues from licenses were $0.7 million, or 16% of total revenues, while revenues from maintenance and additional services were $4.0 million, or 84% of total revenues.


Revenue Distribution for Full Year 2016


Revenues in the Americas represented 70.4%, revenues in Europe represented 18.5% and revenues in Israel represented 4.9% of our total revenues.


Revenues from our customer care and billing software totaled $14.6 million, or 81% of total revenues, compared with $16.6 million, or 79% of total revenues in 2015, while revenues from our enterprise call accounting software were $3.5 million, or 19% of total revenue, compared with $4.3 million or 21% of total revenues in 2015.


Revenues from licenses were $3.9 million, or 21.7% of total revenues, compared with $3.9 million, or 18.8% of total revenues in 2015, while revenues from maintenance and additional services were $14.2 million, or 78.3%, compared with $17.0 million or 81.2% of total revenues in 2015.


Follow-on Orders in Q4 2016


The MIND capability to deliver enhancements timely, in as short as a few weeks for small projects and a few months for larger projects, allows our customers to compete and adapt to changing market conditions. Similar to all other quarters, our customers strengthened their long-lasting relationships with us with multiple follow-on orders.


During the fourth quarter of 2016 MIND was awarded the first contract to upgrade a customer's existing MIND solution to our new version of MINDBill, which will be released in Q2 2017. MIND's latest version offers enhanced capabilities and a brand new Point-of-Sale module, with improved user experience. Similar to previous versions, this new solution supports prepaid and postpaid subscribers from a single platform, includes real-time monetization and subscriber management that enables service providers to support new business models, monetize next generation services, and create an omni-channel customer experience.


A second award is a two-year extension of a managed services agreement with an existing customer of nine years, confirming once again their belief in MIND's capabilities to improve their competitiveness and to support their business goals.


Dividend Distribution


Since July 2003, when we first adopted a dividend policy, according to which we declare, subject to specific Board approval and applicable law, a dividend distribution once per year, we have distributed 13 annual dividends and one special dividend. We continue to believe that our annual dividends enhance shareholders value and we plan to continue with annual distributions.


Taking into consideration the longstanding positive cash flow, the current and foreseeable needs and the remaining cash after the distribution, our Board decided on a distribution based on available retained earnings and declared on February 23, 2017 a gross dividend of $6.16 million, or $0.32 per share. The record date for the dividend will be March 9, 2017 and the payment date will be March 23, 2017. Tax will be withheld at a rate of 25%.


Investing in R&D and Cloud Solutions


As carriers started to adopt cloud-based platforms, we increased our investment in extending our offering for SaaS and cloud-based solutions. Our products are already available for deployment on cloud as well as on premise and we aim towards a 'one click deployment' for cloud and virtualization technologies in order to increase operational efficiency. Our ongoing investment in maintaining a state-of-the-art technology, adding new modules and supporting new platforms is now more focused on cloud technologies and platforms.

History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.

Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]
Suit by Mind CTI Ltd. against its accountant, Kesselmann and Kesselmann[edit]
In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.[19]
Dividend[edit]
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year (once a year, a cash dividend will be distributed, subject to review and approval by the company's board of directors, and the dividend amount will be equal to the company's EBITDA plus financial income (expenses) minus taxes on income.)
From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:

On November 3, 2014, the company announced that the 2015 dividend payment would not require court approval since the company's retained earnings would be adequate relative to the dividend.[22] In February 2015, the company announced that the 2015 dividend would be $0.30 per share.[23]

History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.
Auction Rate Securities[edit]
Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]
Suit by Mind CTI Ltd. against its accountant, Kesselmann and Kesselmann[edit]
In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
In February 2009, the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of the company’s shares in the total amount of US$1.2 million pursuant to the 2008 repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had purchased an aggregate amount of 3,165,092 shares at a total purchase price of US$2.8 million.
In November 2009, the Board of Directors authorized a new plan for the repurchase of the company’s shares, in an amount in cash of up to US$1.8 million. As of December 31, 2011, no repurchases had been made under this new plan and it became non-active.
In August 2012, the company authorized the re-activation of the 2009 plan allowing for the repurchase of the company's ordinary shares in the open market in an amount in cash of up to $1.8 million.[19]
Dividend[edit]
For a technology company, MIND CTI Ltd has an unusual dividend policy in that it, based on certain approvals by its Board of Directors and, in some special situations, the Courts of Israel, pays out ordinary dividends amounting to approximately the company's net income for the previous year (once a year, a cash dividend will be distributed, subject to review and approval by the company's board of directors, and the dividend amount will be equal to the company's EBITDA plus financial income (expenses) minus taxes on income.)
From 2003 the company has issued both ordinary dividends under this policy and extraordinary dividends:

On November 3, 2014, the company announced that the 2015 dividend payment would not require court approval since the company's retained earnings would be adequate relative to the dividend.[22] In February 2015, the company announced that the 2015 dividend would be $0.30 per share.[23]

History[edit]
Inception, IPO, and growth history[edit]
MIND CTI Ltd. was founded in 1995 by the company's current Chief Executive Officer Monica Iancu, née Eisinger, and Lior Salansky in Yokneam, Israel.[1]
In August 2000 the company had an initial public offering on NASDAQ, and in 2002 the company’s shares were also listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange[2] and were included in the TA-100 Index of leading shares for a while, but in Norvember of 2009, the company delisted from the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: MNDO) and now is listed exclusive with NASDAQ.[3]
At the time of its initial public offering the company reported revenues of US$ 8.196 million and net income of US$1.514 million for year 1999, and had raised funding of approximately US$15 million from ADC Teledata Communications Ltd., a subsidiary of ADC Telecommunications, and a syndicate of investors including Summit Ventures.[1] The initial public offering yielded net proceeds of US$29.9 million for the company, and in 2001 the company reported revenues of US$15.613 million, net income of US$3.748 million, and working capital of US$46.6 million as of December 31, 2000.[4]
In 2001, the company acquired from Veramark Technologies Inc. all the rights for the VeraBill product line, a mediation, provisioning and billing solution for wireline and wireless mid-size carriers, for US$1 million.[5]
In 2005 the company acquired Sentori Inc., a provider of customer care and billing solutions to rural wireless carriers and MVNOs, mainly in the United States, for an estimated US$4.426 million in cash, noting that the transaction carried a goodwill of US$6.966 million, intangible assets of US$1.871 million, and current liabilities of US$5.062 million.[6]
In 2007, the company acquired Omni Consulting Company Limited (doing business as "Abacus Billing,") a provider of billing and customer care solutions in a service bureau mode, mainly in Europe, for an estimated US$5.972 million in cash (including expenses) and performance related earn-outs providing for payments through the third quarter of 2009 of up to a maximum of approximately US$1.5 million, noting that the transaction carried goodwill of US$3.339 million (not including goodwill from the performance related earn-outs,) intangible assets of US$1.577 million, and current liabilities of US$1.159 million.[7]
From 2007 through 2009, the company encountered difficulties with the investment of a large part of its assets in auction rate securities, causing write-offs of significant investments from 2007 through 2009. However, these write-off were eventually offset through the settlement of an arbitration action against Credit Suisse Group AG. Aggravating the difficulties with the investments, during the 2007 through 2009 time-period, the company experienced difficulties growing, recording no net-new business in 2008.
Subsequent to the 2009 settlement agreement with Credit Suisse Group AG, the company was sued by an individual investor, purportedly in a class action securities lawsuit, relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. The lawsuit was dismissed in July 2010.
In 2010, the company resumed its growth, securing new key wins, including wins with tier 1 operators and wins related to the deregulation and emerging MVNO market in Israel.
In 2013, the company announced that it would actively pursue acquisitions that satisfied certain criteria, including proven revenue generation, complementary technology and geography and expected accretion to earnings within two to three quarters.
As of December 31, 2013, the company had no employees in the United Kingdom.[8]
In February 2015, the company started its second location in Romania in the city of Suceava.
Auction Rate Securities[edit]
Mantiloking CDO 2006 and Mind CTI Ltd.'s arbitration claim against Credit Suisse[edit]
In the years prior to 2009, MIND CTI Ltd. had US$22.8 million,[9] almost two-thirds of its, then, current assets, tied up in collateralized debt obligation (CDO) bond investments issued by Merrill Lynch and structured as auction rate securities (ARSs),[10] which were subsequently written down in their entirety.[11][12] In September 2009 the company recovered US$18.5 million of the failed investment in an arbitrated settlement with Credit Suisse Group AG, its financial adviser, and, subsequently, in December 2009, the company paid out an extraordinary dividend of US$0.80 per share to its shareholders.[13]
In its Statement of Claim, filed on February 20, 2008, with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority against Credit Suisse, its investment bank, and certain Credit Suisse employees, the company alleged, among other things, "that the bank was supposed to invest [the company's] funds in highly liquid, highly safe, 28-day auction rate securities, but - without [the company's] authorization - invested the funds ... in a security called 'Mantoloking [ARSs]'[9]" and sought recovery of US$22.8 million.
The arbitration action was related to United States vs. Butler, an indictment of two Credit Suisse bankers, Julian Tzolov and Eric Butler, for, among other things, securities and wire fraud,[14] alleging that Tzolov and Butler represented investments in CDO-ARSs as low risk products, guaranteed by the United States government and concealed or falsified the names of the investments to make it appear that these products were other types of ARSs than CDO-ARSs by removing the term "CDO" from the name of the investment, adding the term "student loan" or "SL," or doing both[15] (Tzolov pleaded guilty to in July 2009 and Butler was convicted in August 2009).[9][16]
As part of the arbitration settlement, the company was also reimbursed for US$0.4 million of its legal costs related to the arbitration.[17]
Suit by Sarit Tamar against Mind CTI Ltd. and certain of the company's directors and officers[edit]
During 2009 Sarit Tamar, an individual shareholder in the company, filed a purported class action securities lawsuit against the company, certain of the company's officers, and one of the company's directors. The complaint sought unspecified compensatory damages for, among other things, alleged misleading statements relating primarily to the Company's investment in auction rate securities. Federman and Sherwood (federmanlaw.publishpath.com) represented the plaintiff and Troutman Sanders represented the company. The company defended itself against the suit, and in July 2010 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a decision, dismissing the complaint against all defendants without leave to amend.
In the order dismissing the lawsuit, the Court noted that plaintiff had failed to establish a strong inference of scienter and failed to plead facts showing a primary violation of the securities laws.[9]

In 2009, Mind CTI Ltd. severed its ties with Kesselman and Kesselmann, a PricewaterhouseCoopers firm and the company's accountant during the period that the company invested in auction rate securities, after 12 years of working with the accounting firm.[18]
On or about December 2011, Mind CTI Ltd. brought suit against Kesselmann and Kesselmann, alleging breach of contract, negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the company's investment in the auction rate securities.The lawsuit seeks compensation equal to the difference between the compensation it received from Credit Suisse Group AG and the approximately US$20 million written off (for a total of US$ $1.8 million,) the cost of defending itself the purported class-action suit filed against it in relation to the auction rate securities matter, and the loss of return, economic activity, and goodwill resulting from Kesselmann and Kesselmann's actions. In totality the claim was $5 million ($1.8 million for the investment that was written off, $150,000 in costs related to claims by investors, over $2 million for loss of interest and yield, and $1 million for loss of business, goodwill, and waste of administrative resources.)[18]
Share Buy-back[edit]
In September 2008, the company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the repurchase of up to 2.1 million of the company’s shares, in an amount of up to US$2.8 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had repurchased 2.1 million shares at a total purchase price of approximately US$1.6 million.
