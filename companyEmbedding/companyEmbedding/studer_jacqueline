Dear Dave and all,

I was looking for manual pdf's a few months ago - took a while to find them
all. Here's the short cut:

In the following link, you will find how your Studer equipment is doing, in
terms of maintenance and spare availability:
http://www.studer.ch/pdf/support/studer_spares_availability.pdf

Studer Support in Switzerland (ref. Kurt Schwendener) told me:

"Documents for products beyond the official maintenance period
are available for download from [the Studer] public ftp server :
ftp://ftp.studer.ch/public/Products/

PDF Manuals for products which are still supported [ like the A807, with a
maintenance period until 2010] may be requested from [the Studer] local
representative."

And here's where to find your local Studer rep:

http://www.studer.ch/index.aspx?menu_id=6

NB 1: Not all the Studer representatives are aware of the above and think
everything is available on the ftp (I was referred to the ftp for supported
equipment as well...), but the story ended well - the local rep eventuall
sent me the missing manual on a CD in the mail.

NB 2: the manuals are HUGE - I suggest burning them onto a CD

Good luck!

In the Byzantine period the frequency of domestic pigs increased markedly in all phytogeographic zones and has been attributed to a combination of four  factors: (1) the growth of Christian communities in the region who exhibited a preference for pork, (2) climatic amelioration especially notable in the desert regions, (3) improved hydraulic technology which facilitated a more reliable and extensive water supply especially in the arid zones and, (4) reduced frequency of cattle in the northern region due to culturally induced degradation and loss of pasture to cultivation. The pig, an omnivore and efficient supplier of animal protein then provided a cheap and reliable meat substitute for beef. Thus, a combination of anthropogenic and environmental factors appear to have determined pig exploitation during the Classical periods in this region.

In the Byzantine period the frequency of domestic pigs increased markedly in all phytogeographic zones and has been attributed to a combination of four  factors: (1) the growth of Christian communities in the region who exhibited a preference for pork, (2) climatic amelioration especially notable in the desert regions, (3) improved hydraulic technology which facilitated a more reliable and extensive water supply especially in the arid zones and, (4) reduced frequency of cattle in the northern region due to culturally induced degradation and loss of pasture to cultivation. The pig, an omnivore and efficient supplier of animal protein then provided a cheap and reliable meat substitute for beef. Thus, a combination of anthropogenic and environmental factors appear to have determined pig exploitation during the Classical periods in this region.

L’éperon de Châtel d’Arruffens, sis, dans le Jura vaudois, à près de 1'400 m d’altitude, a été barré, à l’âge du Bronze, par des remparts à noyaux de chaux, d’environ 200 m de long. Il a livré, pour cette période (BzC/D), plusieurs milliers de tessons de céramique et quelques objets, en métal et en pierre. Il a été réoccupé au Bas-Empire, phase pour laquelle ont été retrouvés 243 monnaies, des centaines de tessons de vaisselle en céramique et en pierre ollaire, et de nombreux objets en verre, en bronze, en fer et en os. La nature précise de ces deux occupations reste inconnue, mais elles semblent liées, toutes deux, à des phénomènes d’insécurité et de contrôle du territoire. A partir de l’époque médiévale, le site se transforme en pâturage et il est englobé, actuellement, dans une réserve naturelle. C’est l’intérêt, porté à l’histoire de sa région, par M. Jean-Pierre Gadina, qui l’a conduit à mener des investigations archéologiques sur le site, fournissant ainsi la matière de la présente publication.

Il a livré un système de six grandes fosses rituelles avec mobilier. L’inventaire des formes céramiques et des décors permet de définir pour la Suisse occidentale l’horizon BzD1 (début 13e siècle av. J.-C.) et de le replacer dans le contexte culturel européen. Cette étude est précédée d’une présentation détaillée de l’histoire des recherches portant sur cette période. La distribution topographique des fosses, la répétition de l’organisation interne des dépôts (cairn central – niveau de charbon avec en surface des fragments de céramique en position horizontale – niveau de comblement), la composition des services (petits récipients à boire, pots de cuisson ou de stockage, très grands récipients appropriés pour le brassage de boissons alcoolisées), la découverte d’un objet rituel (croissant en terre cuite), la répartition ciblée des vestiges de faune comprenant des restes de consommation (capriné, porc) et des objets symboliques (cheval, bœuf, chien), la présence de céréales, ainsi que l’usage systématique du feu, le bris et l’enfouissement des vestiges viennent confirmer pour la première fois en Suisse occidentale l’existence au Bronze récent de pratiques rituelles sacrificielles, apparentées à celles qui sont documentées à l’âge du Fer et durant l’Antiquité. Ces activités cultuelles sont resituées par rapport aux découvertes contemporaines de même nature en Europe centrale.
