Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Three reasons to consider bank stocks
Valuations and regulations are among the trends that we’re watching in this industry

  Posted    by  Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist      on  Jun 23, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 

Bank stocks have spun their wheels for most of 2017. Year to date through June 9, the KBW Bank Index (BKX) had risen 3.03% compared to 9.61% for the S&P 500 Index. Banks fizzled as the reflation trade faded and the outlook for fiscal stimulus and meaningful regulatory changes was delayed by the political situation in Washington, DC. However, I believe the banking industry may warrant another look for three reasons:
1. Banks are still inexpensive, while regulation may be slowly loosening
Large banks remain inexpensive in a market focusing more closely on stretched valuations. Although a return to the pre-financial crisis valuation high is not expected, the BKX was trading at 1.76x tangible book value in the week ended June 9, and had recently crossed above the post-financial crisis highs before settling back to hold the old highs established between 2014 and 2015.1 It has been trading at a near 50% discount to its pre-financial crisis price-to-tangible-book ratio of 3.51.1 In contrast, the S&P 500 Index was trading at 8.78x tangible book value and trading 35.6% above the Oct. 2007 pre-financial crisis valuation high.1
KBW Bank Index, price to tangible book value
Weekly data, Jan. 9, 2004, to June 9, 2017
Source: Bloomberg L.P. as of June 9, 2017. The gray line from 2013 onward illustrates that the index has recently risen above its previous highs.
There is a chance for bank valuations to expand as the regulatory environment eases. The Treasury Department’s banking regulation plan released June 12 appeared to be well-received by Wall Street analysts, stoking hopes that banks might be able to more efficiently utilize their balance sheets and improve returns on capital. Moreover, the Treasury Department’s plan came on the heels of the House of Representatives passing the Financial CHOICE Act, which is a roll back of the Dodd-Frank financial regulations.
The BKX’s return on equity was about 8.5%, on June 9, 2017, compared to a peak just over 16.0% in February 2007 prior to the crisis.1 A return to 2007 return on equity levels is unlikely, in my view, but I see room for expansion in a looser regulatory environment.
2. Loan growth may be bottoming
One headwind to banking sector returns has been a slowdown in lending. Some of the weaker growth is related to tough year-ago comparisons, but a second factor is a function of weaker economic activity in 2015 and early 2016.
Loan growth was occurring at a double-digit pace in the first half of 2016 before tailing off and recently marking a lull of just 2% year-over-year in May.1 As 2017 progresses, I expect those year-over-year comparisons to look more favorable and help support the growth rate. More importantly, history suggests that the ISM Manufacturing Index can lead loan growth by roughly one year, as shown in the chart below. The index hit a relative low in August 2016 at 49.6 and rose to a recent peak of 57.7 in February 2017 before trending sideways to slightly lower in recent months.
Manufacturing activity has led loan growth by about a year

3. Mean revision in Treasury market volatility could potentially improve trading profits:
Volatility in the Treasury market, measured by standard deviation, has been historically low and a drag on trading profits. As shown below, the Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate (MOVE) Index finished the week ended June 9 at 52.55. It has seen these levels just 1.4% of the time on a weekly closing basis since Jan. 5, 1990.1
The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate Index has recently traded near historical lows
Source: Bloomberg L.P. as of June 9, 2017
On May 31, both JP Morgan Chase and Bank America noted that second-quarter trading revenues would be hurt by calm markets. A lift in volatility is possible not only on a mean reversion basis, but as the debate over the Federal Reserve unwinding its balance sheet heats up and the European Central Bank looks to end its quantitative easing program with signs of improved economic growth in Europe.1 Additionally, over the past 20 years, there has been a positive relationship between increased Treasury market volatility and rising 10-year Treasury yields.2 Bank shares tend to display strength during periods of rising interest rates.3
A risk to watch
One risk to the value factor and higher bank valuations may rest in low inflation. The Consumer Price Index excluding food and energy has declined from a recent year-over-year peak of 2.3% to 1.7% in May.1 The decline has been driven by motor vehicles, apparel, and household furnishings and operations. Low inflation is a dynamic that could cap long-term interest rates and flatten the yield, while suppressing excitement over a reflation trade.
ETFs of interest
Investors interested in exposure to banks may want to explore the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio (KBWB) or examine the PowerShares S&P 500 Value Portfolio (SPVU). SPVU has nearly 23% exposure to banks and nearly 40% exposure to financial shares as of June 14, 2017.
1 Source: Bloomberg L.P., data as of June 9, 2017
2 Source: Bloomberg L.P., data from June 14, 1997, to June 13, 2017. The correlation between Treasury volatility (the MOVE Index) and the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.19, and the beta of a regression was 0.09, with a t-test of 6.26.
2 Source: Bloomberg L.P., data from June 14, 1997, to June 13, 2017. The correlation between bank stocks (BKX Index) and the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.297, and the beta of a regression was 0.32, with a t-test of 10.03. 
Important information
Blog header image: Who is Danny/Shutterstock.com
Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
The KBW Bank Index is a float-adjusted, modified-market-capitalization-weighted index that seeks to reflect the performance of publicly traded companies that do business as banks or thrifts in the US. An investment cannot be made into an index.
Correlation is the degree to which two investments have historically moved in relation to each other.
Reflation refers to a monetary policy intended to curb the effects of deflation. The reflation trade refers to the practice of investors looking to buy value and cyclical stocks in an effort to benefit from periods of strengthening economic growth, rising inflationary pressures and increasing interest rates.
Tangible book value is a company’s total assets minus liabilities and intangible assets.
Price-to-tangible-book ratio compares a company’s stock price with its tangible book value.
Return on equity (ROE) is a measure of profitability, calculated as net income as a percentage of shareholders’ equity.
The ISM Manufacturing Index, which is based on Institute of Supply Management surveys of more than 300 manufacturing firms, monitors employment, production inventories, new orders and supplier deliveries.
The Consumer Price Index measures change in consumer prices as determined by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Volatility is a statistical measurement of the magnitude of up and down asset price fluctuations over time.
Standard deviation measures a portfolio’s or index’s range of total returns in comparison to the mean.
T-test: After an estimation of a coefficient, the t-statistic for that coefficient is the ratio of the coefficient to its standard error. That can be tested against a t distribution to determine how probable it is that the true value of the coefficient is really zero. A value over the absolute value of 2.0 is seen as statistically significant.
Regression is a statistical measure that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable and a series of other changing variables. Regression helps investment and financial managers to value assets and understand the relationships between variables.
The Merrill Lynch Option Volatility Estimate (MOVE) Index is a yield curve weighted index of normalized implied volatility on one-month Treasury options.
There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The fund’s return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the fund.
Investments focused in a particular industry, such as banking, are subject to greater risk and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments.
The funds are non-diversified and may experience greater volatility than a more diversified investment.
A value style of investing is subject to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns will trail other styles of investing or the overall stock markets.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution

How Ireland’s economy rebounded after the financial crisis
The “Celtic tiger” now leads the eurozone in growth

  Posted    by  John Greenwood, Chief Economist      on  Jul 28, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
Prior to the global financial crisis (GFC), Ireland’s economy was a stellar performer, earning the country the moniker of “Celtic tiger.” The onset of the GFC caused a major economic contraction and a housing crash — but today, Ireland is once again the fastest-growing economy in the eurozone. In this blog, I examine the key elements that allowed Ireland to regain its footing.
Key components of the recovery

Halftime: Mid-year global market review and outlook
Strong earnings growth prospects remain outside the US — in spite of longer-term uncertainty

  Posted    by  Matt Dennis, Senior Portfolio Manager      on  Jul 27, 2017,      in  Capital Growth, Feature 

In the aftermath of a tumultuous 2016, much discussion has centered around the equity outlook for 2017 and beyond. In fact, the second quarter saw continued strong performance from global markets, though in our view, the long-term earnings outlook remains murky. As we enter the second half of the year, Invesco’s International and Global Growth team assesses global equity performance to date through our EQV (earnings, quality and valuation) lens to identify the key areas to watch — along with potential growth opportunities.

Emerging from the shadows — the case for emerging markets
A closer look at catalysts

  Posted    by  Steve Cao, Senior Portfolio Manager      on  Jul 26, 2017,      in  Capital Growth, Feature 

After an extended period of weakness, emerging market equities have rebounded nicely year-to-date — outperforming developed market stocks by a sizeable margin, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and MSCI EAFE Index.1 In my view, this strong performance has been driven by better macroeconomic conditions, strong earnings growth and discounted valuations relative to developed market equities.1
Let’s take a closer look at these emerging market catalysts:

Weekly Market Review: Are emotions overriding facts?
In the US and Europe, sentiment doesn’t seem to match current realities

  Posted    by  Kristina Hooper, Global Market Strategist      on  Jul 24, 2017,      in  Feature, Market & Economic 
Global stocks moved higher last week, driven by a US stock market that continued to advance despite a plethora of negative headlines and a growing likelihood that President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda will not come to fruition in 2017. In addition, US stock market volatility, as measured by the VIX Index, remains very low. It’s almost as if US stocks have a Teflon-like coating around them, shielding them from the brunt of negative news. But why?

Are smart beta ETFs skewing stock valuations?
An analysis of ownership data suggests that ETFs are not the market disrupters they’re portrayed to be

  Posted    by  Eric Pollackov, Global Head of ETF Capital Markets      on  Jul 20, 2017,      in  Feature, PowerShares 
Thanks in large part to the popularity of smart beta and factor-based strategies, adoption of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has grown rapidly in recent years. Some have even speculated that the growth of ETFs is skewing the valuations of certain stocks. I do not believe that is the case. Below, I explain why.
Is the popularity of ETFs affecting single-stock ownership?

Factoring a gap year into college savings
Can 529 funds be used for gap-year expenses?

  Posted    by  Tom Rowley, Director, Retirement and Education Strategies      on  Jul 19, 2017,      in  Feature, Retirement 
I recently had a parent ask me if their child’s 529 college savings account money could be used to help pay for gap-year expenses. Here’s the short answer: Maybe.
If you’re hoping to use your child’s 529 account to pay for travel, extracurricular activities, insurance or medical expenses, the answer is no. If you’re hoping to pay for tuition and fees, books and other qualified educational expenses, then the answer is maybe. Let’s take a closer look at this relatively new option for high school graduates and how a 529 account might play a role.
What is a gap year?

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.
