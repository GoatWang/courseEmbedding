Initial investments range from $1 million to 42 million with a target of $3 million to $5 million per company. OCA Ventures targets initial rounds of $6 million or less but they are opportunistic and will consider smaller and larger deals.OCA Ventures typically participates in a company's first round of institutional capital. This may range from seed stage (pre-product, pre-revenue) to expansion stage ($3 million to $8 million in revenue, near profitability). OCA Ventures looks to own a meaningful portion of their but they are a minority investor and do not often take controlling interest. OCA Ventures typically seeks investments that can return 5x to 10x invested capital or more.                





 Educational Background



Undergraduate Degree 


The University of Chicago

                  The University of Chicago's Office of Investments (COI) is responsible for managing the University's investment assets, which includes overseeing the endowment to ensure that it benefits both current and future generations of the University of Chicago.

Their strategy combines qualitative and quantitative analysis, seeking to achieve superior investment performance on a risk-adjusted basis. COI's approach seeks to evaluate the investment strategy as an integrated part of the operating plans of the University rather than in isolation and focuses the the University's overall success, not investment returns. The endowment is well-diversified across a variety of asset classes, including global stocks and bonds, real estate, natural resources, private equity, absolute return strategies and protection (tail-hedging strategies). Asset class exposure is achieved primarily by selecting and engaging external managers. COI manages the global macro and the overlay portfolio to ensure that the portfolio’s overall positioning is compliance with the endowment's investment guidelines. COI's strategies for investing in the public markets include: Absolute Return, Private Debt, Fixed Income and Credit. and Global Equities. COI's real assets team invests globally in real estate and natural resources using outside managers. The real estate portfolio invests globally in value-added and opportunistic strategies using both private partnerships and public vehicles. The natural resources portfolio invests globally in strategies that include, but are not limited to: oil and gas exploration & production; power generation; infrastructure; timber; mining and minerals; and agriculture.
