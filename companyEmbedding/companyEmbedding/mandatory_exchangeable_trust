About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

† The Equity Summary Score provided by Thomson Reuters StarMine is current as of the date specified.  There may be differences between the Equity Summary Score analyst count and the number of underlying analysts listed.  Due to the timing in receiving ratings changes into the Equity Summary Score model, the Equity Summary Score analyst count may lag the ratings count displayed by one or more days.  There may also be analyst count variations for symbols with multiple share classes and ADRs.  More details on Equity Summary Score calculation are included in the Understanding and Using the Equity Summary Score Methodology (PDF).As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

 Use of Fidelity sites 
The Fidelity Sites are intended only for your personal, non-commercial use, unless you and Fidelity have agreed otherwise in writing.
 
 Fidelity sites and companies 
FMR LLC is the parent company of various Fidelity Entities. Some of these Fidelity Entities are financial services companies, that may be registered under federal or state laws, and others are not regulated as such and may, for example, provide information and content publishing services. A listing of all Fidelity Entities, that provide content on the Fidelity Sites, is listed below.
Portions of certain Fidelity Sites are published or selected by Fidelity Interactive Content Services LLC ("FICS"). FICS is a company with main offices in New York, NY. FICS seeks to present objective news, information, data and guidance on personal finance and investment topics drawn from a diverse collection of sources including affiliated and non-affiliated financial services publications. Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.
The following investments and brokerage products and services are offered through Fidelity Sites by the Fidelity Entity indicated. These four Fidelity Entities are also broker-dealers:

Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios may be offered through the following Fidelity Investments companies: Strategic Advisers, Inc., Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB ("FPTC"), a federal savings bank, or Fidelity Management Trust Company ("FMTC"). Non-deposit investment products and trust services offered through FPTC and FMTC and their affiliates are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, are not obligations of any bank, and are subject to risk, including possible loss of principal. These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, Member NYSE, SIPC and/or Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., distribute fixed and variable insurance products issued by Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Empire Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, New York, NY, and certain third party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with Fidelity Investments.
 
 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.
 
 529 College Savings Plans 
The UNIQUE College Investing Plan, U.Fund College Investing Plan®, Delaware College Investment Plan, and the Fidelity Arizona resident College Savings Plan are offered by the State of New Hampshire, MEFA, the State of Delaware, and the Arizona Commission for Postsecondary Education, respectively, and managed by Fidelity. If you or the designated beneficiary are not a New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, or Arizona resident, you may want to consider, before investing, whether your state or the designated beneficiarys home state offers its residents a plan with alternate state tax advantages or other benefits.
Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites shall be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell a security, or any other product or service, to any person in any jurisdiction where such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the laws of such jurisdiction.

Limited, Fidelity Investments Japan, and Fidelity Brokerage Services Japan LLC offer products and services designed specifically for overseas investors.
 
 Broker-dealer's potential conflicts 
As a broker-dealer, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC or its affiliates may act as principal for its own account or as agent for its customers in connection with the sale to you or purchase by you of a security that is the subject of content prepared by Fidelity. If it receives a mark-up or commission or acts as agent for another person in connection with any such transaction, Fidelity may have a potential conflict of interest. You understand this potential conflict and acknowledge that you may choose to effect securities transactions at another broker-dealer.
 
 Limitations on investment guidance and professional advice 
The Fidelity Sites are not intended to provide legal, tax, investment or insurance advice. Nothing on the Fidelity Sites should be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by Fidelity or any third party. Certain investment planning tools available on the Fidelity Sites may provide general investment education based on your input. You are solely responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy, security or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Stock-for-Stock Monetization





 JV IPO
Cash-Rich Split-Off 

Overview


Frequently, a seller of a business will receive publicly traded shares of the buyer as part of a tax-free stock-for-stock exchange. The structures set forth herein allow the seller to monetize such shares in a tax-efficient manner
To monetize the shares received in the exchange, the seller can enter into a derivative capital markets transaction or a derivative with its investment bank; examples of such are as follows:

Mandatory Exchangeable Notes: A security issued by the Seller (i.e. holder of the Buyer's shares) that mandatorily converts into Buyer shares after a designated period (usually 3-5 years); at the time of the mandatory exchange, the Seller incurs tax as if it had sold its Buyer shares
Standard Exchangeable Notes: A security issued by the company which is exchangeable, at the holder's option, into shares of the buyer; the term of the exchangeable security can be up to 30 years, allowing the company to accomplish tax deferral over a more significant period of time
Collar Coupled with Loan: Seller enters into a put and call arrangement with its investment bank hedging its risk on buyer's shares and borrows against hedged position. Hedge can typically be put on for up to a 10-year deferral period

In addition to these strategies, the investment bank can develop a monetization strategy tailored to the Seller's particular tax, accounting, and regulatory objectives
Precedent transactions: Liberty/Media One

Mandatory Exchangeable Notes - Key Structuring Issues


3-5 year non-callable debt securities, which mandatorily exchange into underlying Buyer common stock, or its cash equivalent, at maturity at the Seller's option

At maturity, the number of Buyer shares delivered is calculated using the 20-day share price average
The value due to investors at maturity can be either cash or stock settled; investor has no conversion option

Senior Note is an obligation of the Seller

Seller maintains ownership of underlying Buyer shares

Number of shares delivered at maturity varies depending on the buyer's stock price such that the Seller retains all of the first 20% of stock price appreciation and 17% of all subsequent appreciation
Quarterly coupon payments are higher than the underlying Buyer common stock dividends to compensate investors for giving up a portion of the upside

Standard Exchangeable Notes - Key Structuring Issues


Exchangeable notes rank as Seller senior debt, typically issued at 100% of face amount, although can be structured on an original issue discount ("OID") basis
Exchangeable into a fixed number of underlying Buyer common shares
Conversion premium remains fixed throughout life
Generally callable after 3 years, but the non-call period can be extended and result in more aggressive pricing
If not converted, the principal amount is redeemed in full by the seller at maturity
The seller may keep a cash settlement option even if the note is in-the-money, but this may narrow buying universe
Can be structured with high conversion premium and correspondingly high coupon

Transaction Structure


Step 1 - Stock-for-Stock Exchange





Buyer acquires Sub shares from Seller in exchange for Buyer common or convertible preferred stock
If Buyer convertible preferred stock is utilized, must constitute participating preferred stock of long-term preferred stock (i.e. maturity of at least 20 years) to qualify as tax-free to Seller




Step 2 - Monetization





Seller enters into a derivative capital markets transaction or a derivative with its investment bank with respect to its Buyer shares, which monetizes the shares without triggering any current tax liability





Exhibit A – Exchangeable Notes - Advantages & Disadvantages


 
 
Advantages
 
Disadvantages


Mandatory Exchangeable



Seller maintains ownership of Buyer shares until conversion

Receives dividend and has voting rights
Captures Dividends Received Deduction

Certainty of sale at current market price of higher while taxable event deferred until shares sold or delivered





High coupon costs
Interest is likely to be capitalized into basis in shares under Straddle Rules
Hedge Accounting - possible to structure with no mark-to-market mismatch




Standard Exchangeable



Seller maintains ownership of Buyer shares until conversion

Receives dividends and has voting rights
Captures Dividends Received Deduction

Provides for long-term deferral of capital gains taxes on appreciated shares





Not a definitive sale of Buyer shares
Longer-term structures will result in high coupons or lower conversion premiums
Interest is likely to be capitalized into basis in shares under Straddle Rules
Under FAS 159, possible to mark-to-market instrument with underlying asset to avoid mismatch caused by earnings volatility

SoftBank Announces a Minimum $7.9 Billion Monetization of its Alibaba Stake in Coordination with Alibaba Group | Business Wire


























































SoftBank Announces a Minimum $7.9 Billion 
      Monetization of its Alibaba Stake in Coordination with Alibaba Group




Proceeds from Capital Raise to Reduce SoftBank’s Leverage


Consistent with the Company’s SoftBank 2.0 Disciplined Capital 
      Structure Management Strategy


SoftBank to Remain Alibaba’s Largest Stockholder and Close Strategic 
      Partner






May 31, 2016 05:16 PM Eastern Daylight Time



TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SoftBank Group Corp. (“SBG”) today announced that it has approved a 
      series of capital raising transactions (the “Transactions”) which 
      involve monetizing a portion of the shares of Alibaba Group Holding 
      Limited (“Alibaba”) held by SBG’s wholly owned subsidiary SB China 
      Holdings Pte Ltd (“SB China”).
    


      Specifically, the Transactions are comprised of (i) the intended sale of 
      $2.0 billion of Alibaba ordinary shares to Alibaba, (ii) the intended 
      sale of $400 million of Alibaba ordinary shares to members of the 
      Alibaba Partnership acting collectively, and the sale of $500 million of 
      Alibaba ordinary shares to a major sovereign wealth fund pursuant to an 
      exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act and (iii) an 
      intention of the Mandatory Exchangeable Trust (“Trust”), a newly formed 
      trust, to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $5.0 
      billion aggregate purchase price of its mandatory exchangeable trust 
      securities (“Trust Securities”) exchangeable into American depositary 
      shares (“ADSs”) of Alibaba in a private placement to qualified 
      institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the U.S. Securities 
      Act. The Trust expects to grant the initial purchasers of the Trust 
      Securities an option to purchase up to an additional $1.0 billion 
      aggregate purchase price of Trust Securities.
    

1. Purpose of the Transactions


      Following SBG’s first investment in Alibaba in 2000, the two companies 
      have built a close relationship through business partnerships, joint 
      ventures, joint investments and other collaborations. SBG Group held 
      32.2%1 of Alibaba’s issued and outstanding shares as of March 
      31, 2016, and Alibaba is an equity method affiliate of SBG. SBG 
      continues to be committed to its partnership with Alibaba, and the 
      Transactions are driven purely by SBG’s capital structure and 
      de-leveraging objectives.
    

      A disciplined approach to capital structure and leverage is fundamental 
      to our SoftBank 2.0 transformation strategy. The Transactions are 
      expected to allow SBG to monetize a portion of its Alibaba shares in 
      order to increase its liquidity cushion, improve SBG’s consolidated net 
      interest-bearing debt / EBITDA ratio (excluding Sprint Corporation) from 
      3.8x as of March 31, 2016 to approximately 3.3x2, and enable 
      flexible and prudent financial management. The sale of Trust Securities 
      is expected to allow SBG to monetize its shares at a potential premium 
      to the current share price, while eliminating downside risks as a result 
      of owning these shares. The Trust Securities are expected to be settled 
      upon exchange by delivery of Alibaba ADSs representing the pledged 
      shares, which is expected to occur on the scheduled exchange date (in 3 
      years), and both the sale of Alibaba ordinary shares and the issuance of 
      the Trust Securities will enhance SBG’s financial profile. SBG plans to 
      use the proceeds of the Transactions for the repayment of 
      interest-bearing debt as well as other general corporate purposes.
    

      SBG would continue to hold approximately 28%3 of Alibaba’s 
      total outstanding shares following the Transactions (excluding the 
      ordinary shares that are expected to collateralize the Trust 
      Securities). Alibaba will remain an equity method associate of SBG. SBG 
      expects that its Alibaba shares will continue to be a core shareholding 
      of SBG and it intends to maintain its strong relationship with Alibaba. 
      SBG’s Chairman & CEO, Masayoshi Son, will remain a board director of 
      Alibaba, and Alibaba’s Executive Chairman, Jack Ma, will remain a board 
      director of SBG.
    

      In connection with the Transactions, SBG will also enter into a lockup 
      agreement with Alibaba under which it has agreed not to transfer any 
      Alibaba shares held by it for a period of six months, subject to certain 
      exceptions.
    

      “When I first met Jack Ma, I knew immediately he had the vision and 
      passion to build the world’s leading e-commerce company, and I was very 
      happy to invest alongside him to help him realize his ambition,” said 
      SBG Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son. “This investment has been 
      phenomenally successful and, over the past 16 years, we have built a 
      close relationship, working together on many exciting projects. In that 
      time, we have not sold any Alibaba shares. There are huge opportunities 
      ahead for Alibaba and SBG looks forward to the continued partnership.”
    

2. Overview of the Transactions


      The Trust will enter into a variable forward purchase agreement to 
      acquire Alibaba shares from West Raptor Holdings, LLC (“WRH LLC”), a 
      wholly owned subsidiary of SoftBank Group International GK (“SBIGK”), 
      which in turn is wholly owned by SBG. At the closing of the offering of 
      the Trust Securities, the Trust will pay to WRH LLC the proceeds 
      received from the issuance of the Trust Securities, excluding amounts in 
      respect of the Trust’s expenses and amounts used to purchase U.S. 
      Treasury securities, which will fund quarterly distributions on the 
      Trust Securities. At the exchange date, which is expected to be the 
      first scheduled trading day after June 1, 2019, the Trust will exchange 
      each Trust Security for a certain number of ADSs (determined with 
      reference to the trading price of the ADSs at that time) or, subject to 
      WRH LLC’s election, cash or a combination of cash and ADSs. Under 
      certain circumstances, including at WRH LLC’s election, the Trust 
      Securities may be exchanged prior to the scheduled exchange date.
    

      In addition, SB China will enter into separate share purchase 
      transactions with each of Alibaba, members of the Alibaba Partnership, 
      acting collectively, and a major sovereign wealth fund for the purchase 
      of approximately $2.9 billion of Alibaba shares held by SB China, of 
      which approximately $2.0 billion of the total is being purchased by 
      Alibaba. The sales to members of the Alibaba Partnership acting 
      collectively, and a major sovereign wealth fund would be exempt from 
      registration pursuant to an exemption from registration under the U.S. 
      Securities Act, and the shares would be eligible for resale under Rule 
      144 following a 6-month holding period (subject to additional 
      restrictions applicable with respect to shares acquired by affiliates 
      under Rule 144).
    

3. Impact on Consolidated Financial Results


      The impact on consolidated financial results from the Transactions will 
      be disclosed as necessary once it is determined.
