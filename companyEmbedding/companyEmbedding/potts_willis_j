Title: 
               Company: Mercy Care Foundation
Job Details
               Mercy Care serves those with the highest need in Atlanta. Since 1985, we have worked to restore vulnerable individuals in the community through powerful outreach programs that care for body, mind and spirit. The Community Homeless Outreach Program (CHOP) team reaches out to street bound homeless persons. By building trusting relationships with those who tend to remain permanently on the fringes of society, we are able to give referrals for critical housing, medical and behavioral health services. In a similar fashion, the Street Medicine program brings doctors out to care for patients who are experiencing homelessness. The HIV Prevention Outreach Team provides HIV screening and information through health fairs and awareness events. The team tests individuals and links positive clients immediately into care at our Early Intervention Clinic. Certified counselors give the HIV Rapid Test to at-risk individuals. Mercy Care's Family Health Promotion programs promote healthy lifestyle choices in the immigrant Latino community by providing prenatal education, parenting and childhood obesity educational classes. The Supportive Services for Veterans and their Families program works in partnership with Hope Atlanta. For veterans who have a source of income and are currently experiencing homelessness, this programs assists with securing housing resources.
