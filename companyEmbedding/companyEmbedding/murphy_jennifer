	The KEVIN.MURPHY line was created by Kevin (originally form Australia) to meets his needs as an editorial hairstylist. 

	Unsatisfied with the performance of mainstream hair products, Kevin recognized the need for WEIGHTLESS products that provided performance, strength and longevity to support today’s ever changing looks.

	Born from the same philosophy as skin care and inspired by nature’s best, the KEVIN.MURPHY line is an indulgence of runway looks and natural aromatherapy catered  for every hair type.

	The products are made from renewable and sustainable resources whenever possible, using pure essential oils, plant extracts and natural anti-oxidants.

	Our commitment and passion to create quality hair care products that guarantee reliability and effectiveness.

	All KEVIN.MURPHY products are sulphate and paraben free.
