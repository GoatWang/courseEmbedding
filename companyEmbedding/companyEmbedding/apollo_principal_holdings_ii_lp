      with its consolidated subsidiaries. This press release may contain 
      forward looking statements that are within the meaning of Section 27A of 
      the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include, 
      but are not limited to, discussions related to Apollo’s expectations 
      regarding the performance of its business, its liquidity and capital 
      resources and the other non-historical statements in the discussion and 
      analysis. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s 
      beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently 
      available to, management. When used in this press release, the words 
      “believe,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend” and similar 
      expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. 
      Although management believes that the expectations reflected in these

      performance, changes in our regulatory environment and tax status, the 
      variability of our revenues, net income and cash flow, our use of 
      leverage to finance our businesses and investments by our funds and 
      litigation risks, among others. We believe these factors include but are 
      not limited to those described under the section entitled “Risk Factors” 
      in Apollo’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended 
      December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (the “SEC”) on February 13, 2017, as such factors may be updated from 
      time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible 
      on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. 
      These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read 
      in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in 
      this press release and in other filings. We undertake no obligation to 
      publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a 
      result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as 
      required by applicable law. This press release does not constitute an 
      offer of Apollo or any Apollo fund.

About Apollo  Apollo is a leading global alternative investment manager with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, St. Louis, Bethesda, Toronto, London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Luxembourg, Mumbai, Delhi, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai. Apollo had assets under management of approximately $192 billion as of December 31, 2016 in private equity, credit and real estate funds invested across a core group of nine industries where Apollo has considerable knowledge and resources. For more information about Apollo, please visit www.agm.com.  Forward Looking Statements  In this press release, references to "Apollo," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer collectively to Apollo Global Management, LLC, together with its consolidated subsidiaries. This press release may contain forward looking statements that are within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include, but are not limited to, discussions related to Apollo's expectations regarding the performance of its business, its liquidity and capital resources and the other non-historical statements in the discussion and analysis. These forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used in this press release, the words "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "intend" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct. These statements are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including risks relating to our dependence on certain key personnel, our ability to raise new private equity, credit or real estate funds, market conditions, generally, our ability to manage our growth, fund performance, changes in our regulatory environment and tax status, the variability of our revenues, net income and cash flow, our use of leverage to finance our businesses and investments by our funds and litigation risks, among others. We believe these factors include but are not limited to those described under the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Apollo's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 13, 2017, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this press release and in other filings. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. This press release does not constitute an offer of Apollo or any Apollo fund.
