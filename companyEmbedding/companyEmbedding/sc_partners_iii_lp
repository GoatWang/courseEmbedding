INDIANAPOLIS, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:   CLMT), a leading independent producer of specialty hydrocarbon and fuel products, announced today the launch of CALPAR 4GIII, the Company's first API Group III synthetic base oil. 













                Calumet Shreveport: Only U.S. base oil refinery with Group I, II, and III production
              

 
 



CALPAR 4GIII is a high quality paraffinic base oil that has been engineered by the Company's in-house R&D and technical refining staff to meet the American Petroleum Institute requirements for Group III base oils. The Group III classification characterizes the most highly refined base oil derived from crude oil, providing viscosity index levels above 120 and very high saturate content.

Low volatility 
High viscosity index 
Excellent low temperature properties 
Outstanding oxidation/thermal stability 

"We are very proud to be the first U.S. based virgin producer of Group III base oil.  The addition of Group III production to our Shreveport product slate demonstrates Calumet's commitment to keeping up with today's evolving marketplace," said Bill Anderson, Executive VP of Sales at Calumet Specialty Products Partners. "This launch broadens and enhances our portfolio, which now includes products across Group I, Group II, Group III and Group V." 
CALPAR 4GIII is available to ship from Calumet's Shreveport, LA refinery and its Burnham, IL terminal. For more information about CALPAR 4GIII or the complete line of CALPAR base oils, please visit www.calumetlubricants.com/group-III.
