"If i could sound like anything it would be the wind and sky, maybe a bit of waterfall and craggy places" 




May almost June ~ 


i have come to the conclusion i am terrible at blogging. All the while it looks like i've shrunk into the mist, but i've been here, busy away, still settling in, unpacking books, enjoying the greenery and finally feeling like i'm home. Meanwhile i've gotten four songs close to a final mix (Melangell, Summer Garden, Where Will It? and Lady Joan), ones i've written, as well as a new version of the Welsh folksong Titrwm Tatrwm. Anxious for next week - and a space of time to get back to it. See you in June x





Hello Spring ~ 


Months later almost moved in ~ this sure is the longest move yet but we're finally settling in. Got recording gear unpacked and put back up vocals, in addition to the other songs i sing, on the upcoming Dragonfyre CD - can't wait to hear the finished product. David Rich is doing a great job with it. Soon i hope to pull out my half done tracks and get back to my album.....just need to catch up on stacking wood, unpacking more kitchen and finding the bedroom ;)





Hello 2016 


Started the new year with a recent move. Wow, it's been a busy couple months packing and setting up but the music room is almost done - and that means soon i'll find my way back to working on my CD - yay!

 “Anything you have the imagination to dream up and the energy to carry out, someone at UNC Asheville will let you do.” That truth has made my life at UNC Asheville, even during my undergraduate days here, rich, challenging and sometimes frustrating, but always fascinating and full.
My interest in stories—yours, mine, ours—is at the heart of my teaching. I believe that searching for and giving expression to our stories will help us discover and better understand ourselves and others. As a teacher of writing, I try to help my students give voice to the stories they are a part of as well as the stories they find around them. I believe that searching out those stories and using them to communicate ideas is an effective means for developing analytical skills as much as creative skills. My training and interest in ethnography has underscored the importance of the relationship between academic inquiry and story. In the effort to search out stories and to craft them, my students also refine their skills of observation and communication. My work as a teacher of writing and literature is further shaped by my commitment to the liberal arts, seeking out connections in unexpected places, alert to complexity and contradiction. Likewise my scholarship and service to the department and the university are driven by my goals as a teacher and informed by my understanding of a liberal arts education.
A significant part of my understanding of liberal arts drives my participation in developing and helping sustain an inclusive community. My intellectual interests are mirrored in the work I do here. Besides teaching in the Department of Literature and Language, I am the director of the first-year Writing Program and an instructor in the Africana Studies Program, directed by Dr. Agya Boakye-Boaten.

Dee D. & The James Gang















DEE D. & THE JAMES GANG



‘Dee D. & The James Gang’ were formed in late 2009 by vocalist/acoustic guitarist Dee D. James and her bass playing husband Keith. After several line-up changes they started to pick up work at holiday camps, clubs and festivals around the UK.
Featuring four lead vocalists, allowing maximum variation of sound, they also combine to give great harmonies.
The band is totally live and play all kinds of country music which makes them suitable for any venue.
This is a professional outfit with a professional attitude.



DEE D. JAMES
Dee was born and raised in ‘The Black Country’, West Midlands. As soon as she could walk she was enrolled into the local dance school, and did many performances with them until she was 19. The transition to vocalist came in 1996 when she began to sing on the cabaret circuit all over the country. When Dee met and married her husband, Keith, they formed a Shania Twain tribute band called ‘Rock This Country! The Shania Twain Show’ and a 70’s disco band – ‘Lee James & Legacy’. Moving to country music in 2006 - this was when she started to learn to play the acoustic guitar & mandolin. As well as the band and her solo work, Dee is also available as a duo/trio. Dee has recently added line dance instruction to her skills – passing her final ‘Best Western Dance Academy’ exam with ‘distinction’.



STUART DEMPSEY-ROBBINS
Stuart’s performing career started at the age of 17. He played the local social club and country music scene with ‘Santee-Fe’ and ‘Touch of Country’ before turning professional when he was 21. With ‘The Bob McKinlay Band’ he toured extensively throughout the UK & Europe, backing international artists. At this time he was nominated for ‘North Country Music – Guitarist of the Year’. Stuart has been heavily influenced by a wide variety of guitarists with different styles and this is portrayed in his playing. He uses a guitar synthesiser to add piano/organ/violins etc. to augment the sound of the band, as well as playing lead/rhythm guitar and singing lead/harmony vocals. Stuart can also play drums, and he and Pat swap instruments during the performance.



GEOFF BATE
Geoff has been a guitarist and vocalist in bands since the age of 14. His first band was ‘The Young Ones’, playing the hits of the day around the local clubs. They eventually changed direction, becoming a blues band. In the 70’s he was involved in a 3-piece rock band called ‘Eazy’ who were signed to Graduate records. This band evolved into ‘Eazy Ryder’ and toured as support for Slade in 1978-79. Geoff turned professional in 1998 with a tribute to The Everly Brothers – ‘The Everlys Experience’ – playing the part of Phil Everly. He sings lead/harmony with ‘Dee D. & The James Gang’, and plays lead/rhythm/slide guitar.



PAT MCGRATH
Pat had an early start in his chosen profession – starting to play the drums aged just 11! When he was 12 he made his first appearance at a local social club with a 7-piece band. All school friends, they took to the road touring the UK, with Pat’s father as road manager for 5 years. Pat decided to take up playing the guitar as a hobby, but has took his playing to another level, moving to the front of the stage to sing and play lead guitar on a few numbers with ‘Dee D. & The James Gang’. His influences include Vince Gill, Brad Paisley & Hal Ketchum. He acquired the award ‘Instrumentalist of the Year’ from Denver, USA, and the trophy has pride of place in his office.



KEITH BIGGS
Keith started to play the guitar aged 12, learning ‘Shadows’ & ‘Beatles’ songs of the day. He switched to the bass when he was 16, joining a local function band. During the 70’s he toured extensively with a cabaret band, and in the 80’s changed direction to the blues. The 90’s saw him all but hang up his bass to become a sound engineer. This enabled him to travel and work with many ‘big’ names – ‘Elvis Presley’s TCB Band’ & ‘Robert Plant’ among them. In 2002 he met Dee and they married a year later. He has played bass in their various projects, ‘Rock This Country! The Shania Twain Show’, ‘Lee James & Legacy’, and now – ‘Dee D. & The James Gang’



Occasionally added to the line-up is vocalist/guitarist ANDY KINGSTON from Wales. He is also our first call to ‘dep’ if anyone is ill or unavailable.
