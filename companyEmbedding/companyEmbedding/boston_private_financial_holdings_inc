Frequently Asked Questions






                  What is Hard Money Lending?
                



Hard Money Lending is a form of asset-based financing where the funds of the borrower will be secured from the value of a property's equity. Interest rates are generally higher compared to conventional loans issued by a financial institution. Hard Money Lending is mostly funded by private entities secured by notes to private investors.








                  How do I pre-qualify for a Hard Money Loan with PB Financial Group Corp?
                



PB Financial Group Corp. makes pre-qualification simple for all applicants. We would like to encourage you first to give us a call at 877.700.3703 to discuss your loan scenario with one of our account executives. They will then advise you on how to best structure a loan for you based on the information you provide them. In turn, we then ask you to complete our loan application form and provide us with specific information on the subject property you wish to either purchase or obtain equity out of. Then send your information to us by either faxing it to 866.318.4471 or emailing info@calhardmoney.com. After a thorough review of your submission, the account executive will then give you a call to discuss more in detail additional conditions to meet the requirements of closing your loan.








                  What does PB Financial Group Corp. look for when pre-qualifying a loan application?
                



PB Financial Group Corp. looks first on the equity of your property. From there we can determine exactly on what the lending limits will be based on your ability to repay, debt-ratio, proof of funds for reserves (for purchase transactions), and your long-term goals with the property. Stated and No Doc programs are available for qualified investment properties and other non-owner occupied properties. PB Financial Group Corp. will help advise you on what you need to understand about your loan (Interest Rate, Terms, Prepayment Penalty, Cost, Title Issues, etc.), and how your decision can help towards the investment on your property.

MPA Hot 100 2014


Pouyan Broukhim
As a real estate investor, Pouyan Broukhim started PB Financial Group Corp in 2006, he saw a need to provide financing to many individuals who where left out of the real estate market and how the real estate market was going to be effected by subprime loans and negative amortized loans. Pouyan realized that the market was going to be changing and not for the best as lenders were making high Loan to Value loans that were not realistic. He decided to open PB Financial Group Corp to help clients regain the equity that they lost when the prices dropped.
READ MORE







Pouyan Broukhim's recent interview withWESTERN REAL ESTATE BUSINESSdiscussing recent trends in 2017 for Commercial Real Estate:



What is the biggest challenge you anticipate for commercial real estate
finance in 2017?
The biggest challenge ahead is uncertainty in credit markets that will bring
rate increases to the private money sector which has been growing in a way
of increased funding from institutional and hedge fund markets over the last
24 to 36 months.







What are you most optimistic about for 2017?
We are very optimistic for 2017, because we expect borrowers who have been
sitting on the sidelines with cash to take advantage of lower interest rates and log into longer fixed interest rates on apartment buildings and commercial
loans. We believe the start of the Fed increasing rates will positively affect the real estate market as a whole. Until affordability is challenged, the real
estate market will be strong in all aspects.
What sectors of commercial real estate are you seeing the most activity with?
Apartment buildings always have high activity and that activity will only increase. With rental rates increasing, we see a lot of investors taking advantage of transactions that require repositioning for the highest and best rate of returns on their investments.
Are there any property types where lending has slowed noticeably?
We believe retail will experience growing pains as online retailers take a bigger market share from smaller retail stores. We are very cautious in lending to bigger retail stores with high overhead.
What other factors will most affect the lending environment in 2017 — and specifically what effects do you anticipate?
I think the challenges we will see in 2017 are going to be the by-product of interest rates. We expect the market to get hot before it stumbles about 10-15%
in 2018 to 2020.

Property values/cap rates – The apartment market will have much lower caps as investors get more aggressive with the opportunities in repositioning
their assets.
Are you seeing changes in underwriting? Underwriting standards seem to be relaxing as competition from new investors and banks see higher profit
margins with the increase in rates.
Legislative/governmental – There is high probably that the incoming administration will reduce regulation, but regulation is not bad in this growing
environment, and a projection in decrease in values within 18 to 36 months.

With regard to commercial real estate, what are the bright spots(geographically or by property type) and what are the weak spots (geographically or by property type)?
As bigger cities get bigger, we expect apartments and units in major metropolitan cities to grow significantly in the next 12 to 36 months as there is a major shift in affordability with minimum wage increases.

WHAT IS A HARD MONEY LOAN?
Date:November 22, 2016
Finding the ideal investment property is no easy task, it can take days, weeks, or months.

This is where a hard money loan in Los Angeles comes into the picture.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT TRUST DEED INVESTING
Q: What exactly is a trust deed - and, what are trust deed investments?
A: A trust deed (or a deed of trust) is a document filed with a county recorder's office indicating that there is a loan against a property - creating a secured lien on the property, providing collateral for the lender or lenders. (Terminology may differ outside of California - some states may use a mortgage instrument, for example - but the filing of some sort of lien is typical when mortgage loans are provided.) Trust deed investments are opportunities for individuals to provide these mortgage loans privately, working through a licensed intermediary like PB Financial Group Corp.
Q: What are the benefits of trust deed investing?
A: Trust deed investing offers a combination of high returns and monthly cash flow with a secured investment. Investors receive monthly interest payments on their invested capital as they would with a fixed income investment or money market fund, but the yields are typically higher based on the amount of risk involved
Trust deeds also offer a vehicle for investing in real estate without the need to manage property. They're an excellent way to diversify a portfolio. Plus, unlike publicly traded real estate related securities - e.g., CMOs, MBSs, REITs - trust deed investments are straightforward and easy to understand.
Q: What are the risks associated with trust deed investing?
A: There are four main sources of risk with trust deed investing: property devaluation, interruption of cash flow (i.e., borrower fails to make payments), legal action, and, in the case of second position deeds, loss in the event of a foreclosure and sale of the senior lien. PB Financial Group Corp aims to manage all of these risks on behalf of investors. For example, requiring an appropriate loan-to-value (LTV) ratio keeps property devaluation risk to a minimum.
Q: How do I choose a reputable mortgage company specializing in trust deed investments?
A: Find a company that has a successful track record of providing these types of investments. Research the company online at the website for the California Bureau of Real Estate (www.dre.ca.gov), where you can check to see if the company has an active license or any consumer complaints against them. 
A: You can invest in trust deeds in your IRA or pension provided that it is self-directed.
Custodians who can help you set up a self-directed account include:

IRA Services Trust Company www.iraservices.com 
PENSCO www.pensco.com 
Polycomp www.polycomp.net

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
