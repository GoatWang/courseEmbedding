Our BrandsMerchantingRetailingManufacturing























MacBlair was formed in January 1973 as the result of a merger between two of Northern Irelands best known and much respected firms at the time, Norman Macnaughton and Son’s Ltd, a builders and plumbers merchant established on 26 May 1908 and acquired by Blue Circle Cement in the 1920’s, and Joseph Blair Ltd, a hardware and ironmongery provider established on 29 September 1907 and acquired by Blue Circle Cement in 1973.
The new business was located on the Boucher Road in Belfast where it still operates from today. The single site operation was acquired by Grafton Group plc on 29 August 1989, one of Grafton’s very first acquisitions in the UK. The business grew through a series of acquisitions between 1997 and 2008, increasing the builders merchant branch network in NI to 16 branches plus one in Douglas, Isle of Man. MacBlair is the leading builders merchant operation in NI. In early 2008 we acquired Moffett Thallon, a specialist provider of doors and ironmongery to the commercial, housing and RMI sectors in the province, and the Lloyd Worrall and Yannedis architectural ironmongery branded businesses in England, building on our strong heritage in the architectural ironmongery sector going back to the days of Joseph Blair. The architectural ironmongery business is now branded Lloyd Worrall Group and trades from 6 branches in NI and GB.
Established in 1973 and trading from 17 branches MacBlair are the leading builders merchant in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, with specialist brands Watershed Bathrooms and Tiles, Moffett Thallon Doorways, MacBlair Hire, MacBlair Civils and paint supplier MRCB.
We supply to the trade, DIY and self build markets providing “a one stop shop” including building materials, timber, doors and floors, plumbing and heating, bathrooms, landscaping and hire supplies. Our knowledgeable staff have a wealth of experience and are on hand to offer advice and support. This in-house expertise has earned us a reputation for being a leading authority within the NI building and construction industry. This is particularly evident within our specialist divisions such as MacBlair Hire and MacBlair Civils. MacBlair Civils offers the widest selection of civils and environmental protection products to the civil engineering and construction industries. MacBlair Hire provides an easy solution to hiring everyday plant, tools and equipment.
Our aim is to achieve consistently high standards and promote continuous improvement of customer service through our commitment to staff training and development. We pride ourselves on our customer service and believe that it’s our employees who really set us apart from the competition.
