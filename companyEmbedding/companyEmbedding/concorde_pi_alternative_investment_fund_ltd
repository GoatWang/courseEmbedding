Concorde Asset Management currently manages over 30 funds, and is the longest standing independent asset manager locally, with an 18 year track record. We have in house expertise in global macro economics, Central and Eastern European equities and fixed income. Investment managers draw on a number of these sources as well as standard market data services like Bloomberg and Reuters and have access to analyst reviews internationally.
The 16 investment managers responsible for managing the Concorde funds keep the requirements of the specific mandates and associated risk constrains at the fore. We believe that flexibility and quick time to market are key attributes of a successfully managed hedge fund. This is why at Concorde the investment decision making process is not encumbered with bureaucratic hurdles. None the less, our procedures are within the legal guidelines and at times are subject to more stringent scrutiny to fairly serve client interest.
Five of Concorde Asset Management’s funds are being made available to investors internationally. Four of these follow an absolute return strategy, while one, Concorde 2000, our flagship vehicle with a 18 year track record, is a long only Central and Eastern European balanced fund.

Platina Pí Absolute Return Fund
Concorde’s Platina Pí fund is an absolute return fund with a target return of ten percent over the risk free rate, irrespective of the macro economic and capital market environment, while maintaining moderate risk exposure. Since its inception in 2006 it achieved an annualised return of 15.67% with the annualised standard deviation of daily returns being 12.11% and a Sharpe ratio of 0.72.*
Concorde-VM Absolute Return Fund
Concorde-VM is the most conservative of Concorde Asset Management’s absolute return strategies. The Fund’s objectives are two pronged; the return objective of five to ten percent over the risk free rate is complemented by a strong focus on capital preservation. The managers’, Ferenc Faragó and Tamás Makara, success in reaching this objective had been borne out by the Fund’s performance. Concorde-VM’s performance has always been positive for any 12 month period since its inception, while the annualised since inception return of Concorde-VM was 8.74% with no leverage. The annualised standard deviation of daily returns for the same period was 3.72% and the Sharpe ratio 0.52.*
Concorde Columbus Absolute Return Fund
Concorde Columbus Absolute Return Fund has a global mandate and may invest in a broad selection of assets including equities, bonds, commodities as well as derivative instruments with the prior as underlying assets. Due to the significant local expertise of the managers; Daniel Móricz and Tamás Cser the Fund is overweight in Central and Eastern European positions be it long or short. The managers primarily rely on fundamental analysis when selecting assets, albeit market timing may be influenced by technical factors. Concorde Columbus is managed with a relative value approach, often investing in securities that are less well covered by analysts and are consequently under valued.
Citadella Absolute Return Fund
Citadella is one of Concorde Asset Management’s absolute return funds. Viktor Zsiday, the manager of the fund, combines a global macro approach with technical analysis to generate target returns of five to ten percent over the risk free rate.

Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
