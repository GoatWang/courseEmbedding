NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) announced today the 
      appointment of Peter Zaffino as Executive Vice President, Global Chief 
      Operating Officer effective August 1, 2017. Mr. Zaffino joins AIG after 
      serving as Chief Executive Officer of Marsh LLC – a leading global 
      insurance brokerage and risk management firm and subsidiary of Marsh & 
      McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC) – and as Chairman of the Risk and 
      Insurance Services segment of MMC since 2015. He was also a member of 
      MMC’s Executive Committee since 2008.
    

      In his role at AIG, Mr. Zaffino will lead the day-to-day business of all 
      country operations, including U.S. Commercial field operations and AIG’s 
      Multinational organization, as well as Global Business Services, 
      Administration and Communications. Working closely with the CEO and 
      Executive Leadership Team, he will develop AIG’s long-term strategy and 
      operating plan, and be responsible for executing the Commercial and 
      Consumer strategies to achieve growth and profitability objectives.
    

      Brian Duperreault, AIG's President and Chief Executive Officer, said: 
      “Peter is one of the most talented executives operating in the insurance 
      industry. AIG’s field operations will benefit from Peter’s experience 
      across all aspects of the business, most recently with one of the 
      world’s largest brokers. Adding his deep insurance knowledge and 
      expertise to the leadership team at AIG will accelerate our efforts to 
      build and expand on this great franchise.”
    

      Mr. Zaffino said: “I worked closely with Brian during his tenure at MMC. 
      We are both driven to help our organizations achieve their greatest 
      potential. This comes with a dedication to operational excellence and 
      empowering those closest to our clients to create valuable risk 
      solutions for customers wherever they are in the world. I look forward 
      to joining the talented team at AIG and contributing to the success of 
      the company’s next chapter.”
    

      Mr. Zaffino has over 25 years of experience in the insurance and 
      reinsurance industry. Prior to being named Marsh CEO in 2011, he was 
      President and CEO of Guy Carpenter & Company, LLC, a leading global risk 
      and reinsurance specialist and a subsidiary of MMC, having previously 
      held a number of senior roles at the firm. Prior to joining Guy 
      Carpenter in 2001, he held several senior positions, including serving 
      in an executive role with a GE Capital portfolio company. Mr. Zaffino 
      earned a BA in economics from Boston College and an MBA in finance from 
      New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business.

American International Group Inc. Chief Executive Brian Duperreault has hired former Marsh & McLennan Cos. colleague Peter Zaffino to be one of his top lieutenants, his first high-profile recruit since joining the insurance giant in May. 







Continue Reading Below


Mr. Zaffino will start as executive vice president and global chief operating officer on Aug. 1. 
He comes to AIG after six years as CEO of Marsh & McLennan's Marsh brokerage unit. He was also chairman of Marsh & McLennan's risk and insurance-services operation. 
Mr. Duperreault was CEO of Marsh & McLennan from 2008 to 2012. 
Mr. Zaffino's selection was first reported by trade publication Insurance Insider. 
Mr. Zaffino is expected to become a key part of a team tasked with improving AIG's profit margins after years in which the company has trailed many peers.

Some of its woes stem from its near collapse in the 2008 global financial crisis. A U.S. government bailout required it to sell off some prized businesses to fully repay nearly $185 billion provided by taxpayers. 
Mr. Duperreault was named to the top job after a profit-improvement plan championed by the previous AIG chief executive, Peter Hancock, fell behind schedule. 
Some activist investors -- including Carl Icahn, who has a representative on AIG"s board -- last year called for the insurance conglomerate to improve its results by splitting itself apart. But those investors have given AIG some leeway to improve returns using other methods. 
Mr. Hancock's strategy was to eliminate, or shrink, lines of business that didn't meet profit-margin targets, cut costs and return $25 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. 
Thus far Mr. Duperreault has said he is open to slowing down the firm's share buybacks and instead using the capital for acquisitions. He also has said he won't split up AIG and instead pledged to "grow it." 
He has said he doesn't have specific acquisitions in mind but was "open for business" and believes there are "lots of growth opportunities," internationally in particular.

It is Mr. Duperreault's first high-profile recruit since joining the insurance giant in May. 
Mr. Zaffino most recently was CEO of Marsh & McLennan's Marsh brokerage unit, a job he held starting in 2011. He was also chairman of Marsh & McLennan's risk and insurance-services operation. 
Mr. Duperreault was CEO of Marsh & McLennan from 2008 to 2012. 
Mr. Zaffino's selection was first reported by trade publication Insurance Insider. 
Mr. Zaffino is expected to become a key part of a team tasked with improving AIG's profit margins after years in which the company has trailed many peers.

Some of its woes stem from its near collapse in the 2008 global financial crisis. A U.S. government bailout required it to sell off some prized businesses to fully repay nearly $185 billion provided by taxpayers. 
Mr. Duperreault was named to the top job after a profit-improvement plan championed by the previous AIG chief executive, Peter Hancock, fell behind schedule. 
Some activist investors -- including Carl Icahn, who has a representative on AIG"s board -- last year called for the insurance conglomerate to improve its results by splitting itself apart. But those investors have given AIG some leeway to improve returns using other methods.

                Zaffino’s pay package includes $15 million sign-on award
            



                Former Marsh & McLennan executive joins insurer on Aug. 1
            



American International Group Inc.’s incoming Chief Operating Officer Peter Zaffino is getting a $23.5 million pay package, including a $15 million sign-on award.Zaffino, who’s joining the insurer next month, also will receive $1.25 million in salary, a cash bonus with a $3 million target and $4.25 million in restricted stock units, AIG said Thursday in a regulatory filing. The restricted shares are split so that 70 percent are based on performance and vest in December 2019. Zaffino must remain with the company until then to get the rest.

Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who took over in May to improve AIG’s profitability, is seeking to expand a bench of talent. Hiring executives like Zaffino is critical to succession planning at the New York-based insurer, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Ryan Tunis said in a note to clients earlier this year. Zaffino, 50, previously worked at insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan Cos., where Duperreault, 70, had been CEO.

The remainder of that award will be paid in cash in February 2018 and January 2019.Marsh & McLennan gave him a $9.11 million pay package last year, according to a March filing.

Marsh CEO Peter Zaffino to Join AIG as Deputy to CEO









Tony Owusu




Jul 5, 2017 3:17 PM EDT













 














































































 Peter Zaffino, CEO of insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. (MMC) , will be tapped to be deputy to new American International Group Inc. (AIG) CEO Brian Duperreault, according to a report by Insurance Insider.  AIG hired Duperreault earlier this year as it looked to turn around its insurance operations following the departure of former CEO Peter Hancock. Zaffino held various roles at Marsh, which he joined in 2001. Duperreault is also a Marsh alum, after serving as the company's CEO between 2008 and 2012. AIG shares were down 0.8% to $62.78 in afternoon trading Wednesday.  What's Hot On TheStreet Volvo is no longer feeling gas engines: Ford's (F) founder Henry Ford may be rolling over in his grave on this one. Volvo Cars said Wednesday that all of its cars will feature an electric engine from 2019, as it embraces of the new technology in the face of industry-wide adoption. The Swedish car maker will roll out a mix of all-electric, hybrid and mild hybrid cars from 2019 and will no longer offer vehicles that carry just a traditional internal combustion engine, TheStreet reports. "This announcement marks the end of the solely combustion engine-powered car," said CEO Hakan Samuelsson. "Volvo Cars has stated that it plans to have sold a total of 1 million electrified cars by 2025. When we said it we meant it. This is how we are going to do it." Meanwhile, Nissan said Wednesday that its new all-electric Leaf will hit markets starting September 6.
