Linking migratory shorebird habitats: The power of stable isotopesProduct Type: Science FeatureYear: 2001Author(s): Farmer, A. and J. WilsonSuggested Citation: Farmer, A. and J. Wilson. 2001. Linking migratory shorebird habitats: The power of stable isotopes. 01/01/1901Effective management of migratory birds requires that we know where they go for the breeding and non-breeding seasons, and where they stop in between. Traditionally, biologists have used leg bands for tracking the paths of migrating birds, but for non-game species, banding has yielded relatively little information about their seasonal movements. Consequently, biologists cannot identify which habitats are limiting for many migratory species because the links between seasonal habitats have not been clearly established. In recent years, there has been a growing concern about the effects of local, regional, and global changes on habitats for many migratory species, including more than 30 shorebird species that breed in North America but spend the non-breeding season in Central or South America. Wildlife managers from many countries are working together to identify priorities and to focus their management efforts to conserve migratory shorebird species. A promising new tool—stable isotope analysis—may be helpful in their endeavor...

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
