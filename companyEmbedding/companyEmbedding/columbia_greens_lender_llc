MortgageLoan.com - Where the lenders compete for You!

Green Tree MortgageIntroduction to Green Tree Servicing, LLC Green Tree Servicing, LLC, is a mortgage servicer and broker with operations throughout the United States. As a mortgage servicer, it handles billings and other aspects of managing mortgage accounts on behalf of other entities. As a mortgage broker, it works with multiple lenders to find those that are best suited to meet the needs of individual borrowers. Aside from the company logo and slogan (“relationships that work”), the two sides of the business maintain largely separate identities – the web site for the brokerage makes no mention of the mortgage servicing operations, and vice versa, with no shared links or contact information for the other. The mortgage servicing operation has its headquarters in St. Paul, Minn., while mortgage broker part of the business is based in Tustin, Calif. Green Tree also offers a variety of types of insurance through its Green Tree Insurance Agency, including homeowner’s insurance on mobile homes, warranty insurance covering appliances and various home systems, and automobile, RV, boat and motorcycle insurance. The company is sometimes referred to as Green Tree Financial or Green Tree Credit Holdings. In addition, it is one of several companies in the mortgage industry that have “green tree” in their names, which can make things confusing for consumers. Other, nonaffiliated companies with similar names include Greentree Mortgage Services, Inc. of Holland, Ohio and Greentree Mortgage Company, L.P. of Marlton, N.J. Green Tree was acquired by Walter Investment Management Corp. in July 2011. A press release announcing the transaction describes Green Tree as providing “high-touch, third-party servicing of credit-sensitive consumer loans.” Green Tree Mortgage OfferingsAs a mortgage broker, Green Tree Services, LLC does not make loans itself but works with a broad range of lenders offering a variety of mortgage products in order to meet a customer’s needs. In so doing, a mortgage broker can help a borrower obtain a lower mortgage rate than they might have been able to obtain on their own. Mortgage brokers handle the various details of processing the mortgage application and shepherding it through the closing process. They can often be useful for borrowers with specific needs who need help finding the right lender. Green Tree handles a variety of mortgage products, including 30- and 15- year fixed-rate loans, and 3/1, 5/1 and 7/1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Green Tree is licensed as a mortgage broker in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Mortgage RefinancingGreen Tree offers mortgage refinancing on terms similar to its regular mortgages for home purchases. In addition, Green Tree participates in the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) for homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages or have less than 20 percent equity in their homes. As of April 2012, HARP refinances through Green Tree were limited to mortgages with no more than a 125 percent loan-to-value ratio, although the company indicates it may raise or remove that limit in the future. Refinance mortgage rates for conventional refinances or under HARP are at market rates. Due to strong interest in the program, Green Tree responses to HARP inquiries are taking about 60 days as of April 2011.  Mortgage Servicing through Green TreeAs a mortgage servicer, Green Tree handles the business end of managing mortgage accounts. In simple terms, a mortgage servicer is the company you send your mortgage payment to. The servicer, in turn, handle escrow accounts, keeps track of account balances and forwards the appropriate amounts to the investors or other entities to whom the mortgage debt is owed. In return, it collects a fee out of each mortgage payment. If a borrower is having difficulty making their mortgage payments, the mortgage servicer is who they should contact to see about arranging a mortgage loan modification. If a mortgage goes into default, the mortgage servicer is the one that initiates foreclosure proceedings. Loan Modifications and Foreclosure AlternativesIf Green Tree is your mortgage servicer and you are delinquent on your mortgage payments or otherwise in financial difficulty, the company offers a variety of approaches to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. Green Tree participates in the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which can reduce eligible borrower’s mortgage payments in a variety of ways, including reducing the interest rate or extending the repayment term. Help is also available for homeowners with a qualified second lien. For homeowners who do not qualify for HAMP, there are other options available, including a short-term modification of loan terms, an extension of delinquent payments, forbearances and repayment plans.  Homeowners in financial difficulty who do not wish to remain in the property may be able to obtain a short sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Green Tree Servicing InformationGreen Tree ServicingLLC has separate contact information for its mortgage broker and mortgage servicing operations.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer.

Payday Loan Help Can Be Quick and Convenient
GreenPayday can can get you the payday loan help you need — today.
Sometimes, it simply makes more sense to borrow money on a short-term basis through a company that can offer payday loan help than it is to wait for your next payday. Have you ever been in a position where payday was just too far away? You need money today to keep the lights on, go to the doctor or repair your car so you can get to work and earn that much needed paycheck.
The Cost of Not Getting Payday Loan Help
If you are ill, you may not be able to work. If you can’t work, you may find yourself out of more than wages for the missed days. In this economy, with so many people looking for work, you may find yourself out of a job.  The same applies if you do not have a reliable mode of transportation to get to work. Why wait until payday to fix your car, risking that the repairs may be more costly or you may not be able to get to your job?
Putting off payment of a bill can cost large sums of cash in the form of late fees. Allowing your bank account to be overdrawn can cost an incredible amount of money in overdraft fees. Payday loan help is available to keep these costs from spiraling out of control.
How Payday Loan Help Works with GreenPayday
GreenPayday is not a lender and does not provide payday loans but refers consumers to lenders who may provide such loans.  When you request payday loan help at GreenPayday, you not requesting a loan from us.  Instead, you are taking advantage of our network of payday loan providers.
Our online service is entirely free and works to find potential lenders in our network. Simply fill out and submit our encryption-secured online form. If we find a possible lender, you will be presented with the next steps to complete your loan request. If you are presented with a loan offer, you will have the option to review the terms of the loan, which you may approve or decline. We encourage you to always read the terms of your loan thoroughly before accepting them, no matter where you get your loan.
	
Perfect Credit Not Required!
GreenPayday network of lenders works with all credit – including bad credit.  GreenPayday may do a “soft pull” of your credit information, which will not impact your credit score.  Further, the lender that you are connected with may run a credit check with one or more credit agencies.  If you have had many credit checks in a given period of time, it is possible that this check may negatively affect your credit score.
	
There are Minimal Requirements to Get Payday Loan Help with GreenPayday
When you complete your request for payday loan help with GreenPayday, we’ll ask you a few questions to determine your eligibility for a loan with one of our provider lenders.  There are a few basic pieces of information needed to determine eligibility.
		

Are you at least 18 years of age?
Do you have a job that pays at least $1,000/mo. after taxes?
Do you have a checking account in your name?
Are you a citizen of the United States or a Permanent Resident?
Do you have a valid email address?
Can you provide work and home telephone numbers?

If you meet these requirements, then you can qualify for payday loan help with our network of lenders.	
Find a Payday Loan Provider that can Work for You
Taking out a payday loan can be intimidating the first time.  How do you know you can work with a company you’ve only contacted over the Internet?
One way is to use GreenPayday to help find a lender that can work for you.  GreenPayday uses advanced encryption technology to protect your personal information.  We make a reasonable effort to work only with reputable lenders.

Our online service is free and works to find potential lenders in our network that can work for you.
	
The Convenience of Automatic Payment
It goes without saying that when you need an emergency cash loan, you need your money right away.  Because of this, it isn’t always convenient to visit a payday loan establishment to repay your loan.  You weren’t planning that particular errand, so it can be easy to forget.  Rather than risking late fees which can make using a payday loan company more expensive than it needs to be, GreenPayday refers you to lenders who can automatically process your payment on your next payday.
	
It is important to remember to budget for what will amount to a smaller payday after your repayment amount is withdrawn from your account, but the amount of money you can save by seeking payday loan help makes the entire process worth it.
It is important to remember to budget for repayments that will be withdrawn from your account.
Representative APR Range
GreenPayday is not a lender and does not provide short-term loans but connects consumers with potential lenders who may provide such loans. For this reason, we are unable to supply you with an exact APR (Annual Percentage Rate) that you will be charged if you are approved for a loan. APRs vary according to the information supplied by you in your loan request and your lender. You will be given the APR, loan fees, and other terms by your lender when you are redirected to your loan agreement in the loan request process. The APR on a cash loan can range from 200% to 2,290% depending on how the APR is calculated (nominal vs. effective), the duration of the loan, loan fees incurred, late payment fees, non-payment fees, loan renewal actions, and other factors. Keep in mind that the APR range is not your finance charge and your finance charge will be disclosed later on, if applicable.

APR – Interest Rates and Repayment Explained
The annual percentage rate (APR) is the annualized interest rate that you are charged on your installment loan. GreenPayday is not a lender, but it does connect consumers with lenders that offer loans that may work for them. We don't charge fees for this service. GreenPayday does not have the ability tell you what the exact APR that your lender will charge. Annual percentage rates can vary based on not only the information that you supply in your initial loan request, but the information that your lender supplies to you as well.
					
Your lender will give you all details on the annual percentage rate, cash loan finance charges and other terms once you are redirected to the loan agreement during the process of requesting a cash advance loan. If you should require help with any GreenPayday–related services, you can contact us at your convenience.
The APR associated with installment loans can generally range from 6% to 36% percent depending on how it is calculated as well as other variables including any incurred fees (nonpayment, late payment charges, etc.), the term of the loan, and loan renewal options.

Important Points to Consider
GreenPayday makes a reasonable effort to work with reputable lenders dedicated to providing potential borrowers with sufficiently detailed information concerning loan terms and conditions prior to their accepting any installment loan offer. We recommend that you closely view the terms of any loan offer you get. To get more details on these considerations you can view the Lending Policy and Rates & Fees sections of our website.


			


Financial Implications (Interest and Finance Charges)


						If you get approved for a loan, the lender will show you the exact terms, fees and interest rate associated with the loan before you formally agree to its offer. As mentioned earlier, GreenPayday is not a lender, so it therefore is unable to tell you what the exact fees and interest rate attached to your loan offer will be. Please know that you are never under obligation to accept the loan terms that a lender offers you.

					
Representative Example

"If you receive a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of approximately $152.18 at a 6.78% APR."
"In the case of a $15,000 60-month loan at an interest rate of 7.90% with a 3.00% origination fee of $450.00, you will receive a loan amount of $14,550.00 and will make 60 monthly payments of approximately $303.43 at a 9.20% APR."
               



Implications Of Non-payment


					Accepting the terms and conditions for a installment loan offer essentially means that you agree to repay the loan with interest in the time specified in your loan agreement. If you aren't able to repay your loan in full or should you make a late payment, it is likely that supplemental charges could apply. GreenPayday does not have the ability to predict what charges you will incur in the event of nonpayment, late payment or partial payment. In addition, we have no control or knowledge of the loan details between you and your lender.
					

						Make it a point to closely look at the partial payment, late payment and nonpayment terms and policies that are detailed in your loan offer and documents. We make a reasonable effort to work only with reputable lenders dedicated to pursuing collections of past due accounts in a fair and reasonable manner.
					

Potential Impact To Credit Score


					It is important for a borrower to understand that being late on a payment, missing a payment or rolling over a payment will all negatively impact their credit score. Your credit score is a numerical expression of your credit worthiness based on an analysis of your credit files. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information typically sourced from credit bureaus. Failing to pay on time will negatively affect this score and make it harder for you to do things like take out a credit card or get a loan. While less than perfect credit will not necessarily prevent you from being able to receive a loan, all loans are subject to credit approval. GreenPayday may do a "soft pull" of your credit information, which will not impact your credit score. Further, the lender that you are matched with may run a credit check with one or more credit agency. If you have had many credit checks in a given period of time, it is possible that this check may negatively affect your credit score.
					

Collection Practices


						GreenPayday is not a lender and does not get involved in the process of debt collection. As part of the loan documents your lender will provide to you, you will find detailed information concerning their specific debt collection practices. If you are unsure in any way of what those collection practices entail, we suggest that you explore that issue with the lender. At GreenPayday we are proud of our policy to make a reasonable effort to work only with lenders who pursue delinquent accounts in a manner that is fair and reasonable.
					

Loan Renewal Policies


						Prior to accepting a particular loan offer, you will be presented with various loan renewal options by your lender. Carefully look through the lender's loan renewal policy and terms before you electronically sign loan documents of any type. Be aware of the fact that state regulations determine lenders' loan renewal policies to a significant extent.
					

						Payday loans are intended to be a short term financial instrument, and should not be used as a long-term financial solution. At GreenPayday, we always encourage borrowers to repay their loan fully and by the time it is due so they can avoid fees such as late penalties and nonpayment penalties. If you think that you may experience difficulty paying back a loan after borrowing it, GreenPayday advises you to closely examine different loan alternatives before you take the step of requesting loan assistance through us.
