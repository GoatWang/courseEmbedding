            What are the door dimensions when they swing open? I have a narrow space. I know the shed is 5 ft deep but how much more do the doors add to depth when they swing open?
        
Asked by: Jake

            The doors are 30 inches wide each  and swing open to about 150 degree  I have a 4 foot walkway in front of it and can get the lawn mower in and out easily I do have to fold the upper part of the handle over the lower part to make it fit

        Strike Plate on Left Door
I assembled the shed this past weekend with minimal help.  The instructions were good and the materials seem sturdy.  My only issue is that the strike plate (DZG) on the left door jamb comes out too far and the latching mechanism on the right door doesn't clear the strike plate and therefore can't be closed without closing both doors at the same time...which in turn makes the deadbolts obsolete.  Anyone else have this issue or am I just missing something?  Thanks.

I was in dire need of a storage shed. This met my needs and expectations. Like others that mentioned - please be prepared to build a foundation wood or concrete pad. The flooring has a curved lip that overhangs from the foundation so it doesn't move around. My advice is to measure carefully. It's a two-person job ideally. The manual recommends more but too many bodies in this project is ridiculous. My shed did not have the green side panels as shown in the picture. It looks much better that way. Keeps everything I have secure and dry. Just an idea of what I have stowed away: push mower, lawn spreader, gas generator, many lawn tools, yard chemicals, garden related items. If you organize it carefully, you'll fit a lot in there. I originally wanted a "real" wood shed but after pricing that out, leveling an area in the yard, building a large foundation - the Lifetime storage shed seemed like a bargain. If anything, it bought me a lot of time to save up!

        Easy to Build
Using the instructions included, and the videos that can be scanned with the QR scanner on your phone… The shed was very easy to put together. I started at 9:00 and finished at 3:00 and the only assistance I needed was in holding the roof panels in place while setting the screws. I am 5'5" tall and 60 years old!

        Good shed for the money!
I'm pretty happy with the shed. I set it up by myself but should've had one extra person to help . That would've definitely made it easier .The directions were pretty basic but I would recommend spreading out all parts and hardware before starting to illiminate confusion with the markings on the hardware..

My adult son and I put it together in about 3 hours. Although the instructions were mostly pictures the assembly was not too difficult. The most difficult part seemed getting the door hardware assembled. The shed comes in two flat boxes that weigh, collectively about 300 pounds. Individually one box was 125 pounds and the other was about 225 pounds. I have seen reviews that stated the assembly could be done by one person. My experience is that 2 people are definitely a good choice unless you are an octopus. You definitely need to have a flat surface to build the shed upon. The shed does come with some shims (a helpful addition) that came in handy as a final detail in leveling the doors. The shed is secure, solid, and attractive. We are quite happy with this purchase.Written by a customer while visiting samsclub.comWas this review helpful?Yes (0)No (0)ReportGreat features, Easy assembly11/10/2016Average rating:4out of5stars, based onreviews11/10/2016by KatTheBuilder  Verified purchaserPurchased this item over a month ago. I have had to basically put it together by myself. I did convince my husband I needed his assistance. I watched the youtube video for easier assembly instructions. It is up. I need to attach the roof and doors. Then it will be complete. I am working on it in my spare time.

They are a little on the spendy side, but given the shed's excellent design, sturdiness and ease of assembly they are well worth the price. My son and I put the latest one together in less than 3 hours. We bought the original shed two years ago and put it on some acreage on the wet, windy Oregon coast. It has performed marvelously, and is solid as the day we built it. We expect the newest one to fare just as well. I would recommend these sheds to anyone who is in the market for a good, sturdy, expandable shed.

I read many of the reviews on this shed before I bought it. My adult son and I put it together in about 3 hours. Although the instructions were mostly pictures the assembly was not too difficult. The most difficult part seemed getting the door hardware assembled. The shed comes in two flat boxes that weigh, collectively about 300 pounds. Individually one box was 125 pounds and the other was about 225 pounds. I have seen reviews that stated the assembly could be done by one person. My experience is that 2 people are definitely a good choice unless you are an octopus. You definitely need to have a flat surface to build the shed upon. The shed does come with some shims (a helpful addition) that came in handy as a final detail in leveling the doors. The shed is secure, solid, and attractive. We are quite happy with this purchase.

Purchased this item over a month ago. I have had to basically put it together by myself. I did convince my husband I needed his assistance. I watched the youtube video for easier assembly instructions. It is up. I need to attach the roof and doors. Then it will be complete. I am working on it in my spare time. That's the only reason it is taking longer to assemble.

Several screws for wall panels stripped with little effort.  Difficult to line up.  Door instructions difficult to follow and the bushings the rods fit into moved on us.  I'll have to do something to fix that because the doors mess up the alignment all around.

We bought our second one of these sheds last month. They are a little on the spendy side, but given the shed's excellent design, sturdiness and ease of assembly they are well worth the price. My son and I put the latest one together in less than 3 hours. We bought the original shed two years ago and put it on some acreage on the wet, windy Oregon coast. It has performed marvelously, and is solid as the day we built it. We expect the newest one to fare just as well. I would recommend these sheds to anyone who is in the market for a good, sturdy, expandable shed. Two thumbs up!

Product went together well. Instructions were simple and well put together, parts fit correctly and nothing was missing.

This particular model was the exact size we needed.

Loaded it up right after putting it together, had a pretty good storm right after installation. No leaks or problems.

Would definitely recommend.

Even though the directions say that it takes 2 to 3 adults I was able to assemble this by myself with a little ingenuity. Total time was about 8 hours. I did use a power tool to speed the process but the portable Ryobi drill/screwdriver I used had a torque control for the screwdriver mode and I turned it down to a very low setting. Never stripped a screw. This allowed me to hold the parts with one hand and start the screws with the power tool. Just went back and hand tightened. Putting the wall panels up and getting the tabs inserted into the floor panel was a little difficult with only one person. I used grip tight clamps to hold some of the panels together while I screwed them together. You can get them at Lowes, Home Depot or most other hardware stores.
2 problems that I did run into:
1. The 4 screws that tie the flat roof panels and ridge panels did break through the roof. They were not overtightened. I noticed it when I got up on the roof to but the skylights up which is the last step. I got Silcone caulk (bronze matches the roof color perfectly) and caulked the 4 screws to make sure it would stay waterproof.
2. I feel the installation of the roof ridge panels is backwards. The instructions say to start from the front. I had to place my against my house so I couldn't get a ladder in the back and you really need it. Had to do a lot of manipulating to get the middle and rear ridge panels in from the front and inside. If the instructions started from the back it would make more sense as the front of the shed would always have room as the doors open outward.

This shed is a really nice quality shed but it takes an engineer to put it together. So.....unless you have a REALLY handy guy around that can REALLY read good directions do not attempt to assemble this. Other than that, it is an awesome sturdy shed. We put our own sub floor before putting the shed up to make it even sturdier. I am very happy with my shed!

Shed was not hard to put together. It took about 3 hours. You will need a second person for some parts of the assembly. The most difficult part was comprehending the instructions. Don't forget to add a base or wooden platform into the cost of the project. It was about 80 more dollars to build a 5 x 8 platform out of treated 2x4s and plywood.

This shed is just what we were looking for. Spacious enough for a push mower & other basic yard equipment without taking up our whole yard. It did take us a full day to assemble but if you follow the directions step by step you will get there! As everyone else says, the level floor is key!

Whereas there was some mention of difficulty in putting this together, it was not as much as a challenge as we anticipated. Myself and my 13 year old daughter did it with a little help from my wife. It was actually a little fun! Level pad is key, I should say.

Shed is not the advertised size. It is three inches short of eight foot and four and half inches short of five. This is outside wall to outside wall, so with walls that are 3/4 inch wide, it is only four and half feet deep inside. Returned it.

I am pleased with the service and the shed. It did come with a lot of scratches on the front. Any idea how to smooth them out?

Thanks,
Sharon

The shed looks nice and didn't take that long to put together. I would recommend it to anyone that need a small storage shed.

 Q: I am moving to a high wind and rain place will this work?
 Asked by: customer


 
			  - 3/3/2016

 A: This has the ability to anchor to a concrete slab. You can also purchase hurricane straps. If it is next to a building it will do better as well. Lastly, the rain should not get in regardless of how often or how much it rains.

Shipping: Orders for the 6418 Lifetime Garden Shed generally leave the warehouse the next business day. Accurate Tracking: Tracking information is automatically emailed to you just as soon as the order ships out.  Delivery Details: This product ships directly from Lifetime Products in Clearfield, UT.

The freight carrier is instructed to contact you prior to delivery to set up a delivery appointment. The carrier will unload the product by means of a lift gate. In some cases items may be too large to fit on the lift gate and may require assistance from the customer helping unload box-by-box (takes only a few minutes). Signing for the Package: When signing for the delivery it is important to note any damage.  Damage is extremely rare.  We package these to travel both domestically and internationally.  However, sometimes the packaging may be slightly damaged, but you may not be sure whether something inside is damaged.

My adult son and I put it together in about 3 hours. Although the instructions were mostly pictures the assembly was not too difficult. The most difficult part seemed getting the door hardware assembled. The shed comes in two flat boxes that weigh, collectively about 300 pounds. Individually one box was 125 pounds and the other was about 225 pounds. I have seen reviews that stated the assembly could be done by one person. My experience is that 2 people are definitely a good choice unless you are an octopus. You definitely need to have a flat surface to build the shed upon. The shed does come with some shims (a helpful addition) that came in handy as a final detail in leveling the doors. The shed is secure, solid, and attractive. We are quite happy with this purchase.Written by a customer while visiting samsclub.comWas this review helpful?Yes (0)No (0)ReportGreat features, Easy assembly11/10/2016Average rating:4out of5stars, based onreviews11/10/2016by KatTheBuilder  Verified purchaserPurchased this item over a month ago. I have had to basically put it together by myself. I did convince my husband I needed his assistance. I watched the youtube video for easier assembly instructions. It is up. I need to attach the roof and doors. Then it will be complete. I am working on it in my spare time. That's the only reason it is taking longer to assemble.Written by a customer while visiting samsclub.comWas this review helpful?Yes (0)No (0)ReportSounded simple and easy10/31/2016Average rating:3out of5stars, based onreviews10/31/2016by bwb22  Verified purchaserSeveral screws for wall panels stripped with little effort.  Difficult to line up.  Door instructions difficult to follow and the bushings the rods fit into moved on us.  I'll have to do something to fix that because the doors mess up the alignment all around.Written by a customer while visiting samsclub.comWas this review helpful?Yes (0)No (0)ReportLifetime 8'x5' storage shed9/23/2016Average rating:5out of5stars, based onreviews9/23/2016by lamar  Verified purchaserWell made.

They are a little on the spendy side, but given the shed's excellent design, sturdiness and ease of assembly they are well worth the price. My son and I put the latest one together in less than 3 hours. We bought the original shed two years ago and put it on some acreage on the wet, windy Oregon coast. It has performed marvelously, and is solid as the day we built it. We expect the newest one to fare just as well. I would recommend these sheds to anyone who is in the market for a good, sturdy, expandable shed.
