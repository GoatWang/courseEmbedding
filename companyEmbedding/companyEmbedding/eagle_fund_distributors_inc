What We Believe
At Eagle Asset Management, we understand that very few investment managers possess the skill and experience to consistently outperform their peers.
For this reason, we employ portfolio managers who we believe possess the rare talent and insight required to construct portfolios that add risk-adjusted alpha over the long term. Each strategy is supported by an investment team performing research that support the distinctive value-added process. We believe this independent team approach builds strong chemistry and increases accountability.
While the investment process employed by each team may be different, at the heart of every program is a strong focus on idea generation and proprietary research. We make every effort to avoid momentum-driven securities, risky bets and trendy market favorites with irrational valuations or unreasonable risk/return trade-offs.
At Eagle, we are proud to embrace and embody the investment fundamentals our clients demand from active portfolio management.

Fixed Income
Fixed-income securities have proven over time to be a critical part of well-allocated portfolios because it is important to have assets that arent correlated to stock-market investments.  Bond investing has become increasingly challenging over the years and we believe that an actively managed fixed-income portfolio  either through a separately managed account or a mutual fund  may make sense for long-term investors. To that end, Eagle has employed an experienced team of bond managers, analysts and traders to help investors meet their long-term financial goals.
We offer a wide range of both taxable and tax-advantaged programs  all of which share our focus on fundamental research  we invite you to consider.  Click the charts below to learn more.




Taxable



Tax-advantaged







Risk Information
Risks associated with Fixed Income investing: many investors consider bonds to be “risk free” investment vehicles. Historically, bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital than has equity investing. However, there are many factors that may affect the risk and return profile of a fixed-income portfolio. The two most prominent factors are interest-rate movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer. Bonds issued by the U.S. government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by corporations and municipalities. However, the overall return on government bonds tends to be less than these other types of fixed-income securities. Investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixed-income securities that comprise their portfolio, and remember that, as with all investments, there is the risk of the loss of capital. 

Not every investment opportunity will meet all of the stringent investment criteria mentioned to the same degree. Trade-offs must be made, which is where experience and judgment play a key role. Accounts are invested at the discretion of the portfolio manager and may take up to 60 days to become fully invested.


Be sure to consider your financial needs, goals, and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Eagle does not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice. Any statement contained in this communication concerning U.S. tax matters was not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code. Before making any investment decisions, you should obtain your own independent tax and legal advice based on your particular circumstances.

The tires would bounce in reaction to bumps, and tires that aren’t on the ground can’t direct, move or stop the vehicle. The suspension keeps the wheels in contact with the road surface for steering and traction, so power gets to the ground and you can remain in control. All suspensions have springs to absorb bumps and shock absorbers to control the action of the springs.Categories (24,539)Shocks & StrutsShock Absorbers, Strut Assemblies(6,489)Coil SpringsCoil Spring Sets, Coil Spring Seats(1,367)Leaf SpringsLeaf Spring Sets & Bushings(1,084)Air SuspensionAir Springs, Shocks, Air Lines(21,116)Control ArmsArm Assemblies, Strut Rods(12,621)Sway BarsSway Bar Bushings, End Links(4,672)Ball JointsUpper & Lower Ball Joints(95)Torsion BarsTorsion Bar Sets & Mounting Kits(323)Panhard BarsTrack Bars, Watts Links, Bushings(5,162)Shock & Strut HardwareUpper Strut Mounts, Shock Boots(372)Self-Leveling SensorsSelf Leveling Units & Relays(11,610)Suspension BushingsBushing Kits, Shaft Kits & Bumpers(1,056)Alignment KitsCamber Plates, Cam Bolts, Toe Kits(1,160)Suspension & Steering ToolsSpring Compressors, Axle Sockets(117)Suspension LubricantsGreasing Prevents WearFeatured BrandsMonroeArnottMOOGKYBDormanUnity AutomotiveMevotechFCSBilsteinGabrielACDelcoCentricSuncoreBeck ArnleyGenuineMiessler AutomotiveSachsSenSenFirst Equipment QualityURO PartsGSP North AmericaWestarOSC AutomotiveLemfoerderMotorcraftCardoneRight Stuff DetailingMoparOmix-AdaTRWThere are far too many suspension system designs for a detailed discussion here, but all can be divided into solid (beam) axle suspension and independent suspension. A solid axle is so called because the wheels on either side of the vehicle are linked by a rigid axle housing, and a bump in the road that affects one wheel will also disturb the wheel on the other side. Solid axles can be live axles that transmit power to the wheels or dead axles that do not. As the name implies, independent suspensions allow the wheels to move independently of each other, and the effect of a bump on the road encountered by one wheel will be isolated to that wheel and will not affect the wheel on the other side of the vehicle.Show items:6090120Sort by:RecommendedPrice Low to HighPrice High to LowTop Rated ProductsMonroe® Econo-Matic™ Complete Strut Assemblies(15 reviews)# sp4351Econo-Matic™ Complete Strut Assemblies by Monroe®.

A strut is a type of shock absorber that also serves as a supporting suspension member. There are modified struts where the springs are separate, but the most common type is the MacPherson strut, which incorporates a shock, spring and suspension member in one unit. When used at the front of the vehicle, the top of the strut is the upper steering pivot. Shock absorbers are used with control arm suspensions. Shocks and struts are the most commonly serviced suspension parts. Because they deteriorate gradually and degrade handling and ride quality, it is recommended that they be replaced after 50,000 miles.Leaf springs are the oldest type of springs and generally used to both suspend and locate live axles. They are the springs of choice for hauling because they can carry heavy loads and the capacity can be easily increased by adding leaves. Coil springs are the most common type of spring in use today. They are much easier to tune for specific ride and/or handling characteristics than leaf springs, making them ideal for performance vehicles. Torsion bars are lengths of spring steel that serve the same purpose as coil springs. The advantage of torsion bars is that they can be adjusted to correct vehicle ride height. Air suspension air springs use compressed air to provide a smooth ride and suspension leveling.The wheels, springs, and shocks or struts are attached to the vehicle with suspension members called control arms. Control arms can be called different names according to the suspension system and where they are located on the vehicle, including short and long arms, radius arms, and trailing arms. In general they are made of stamped steel or aluminum and articulate by means of bushings and ball joints. The control arms themselves are generally very durable and usually only replaced if bent, but the bushings and ball joints wear and require replacement to eliminate play that can affect handling and alignment. Sway bars are a type of torsion bar that connects the wheels on both sides of the vehicle to reduce body roll in turns.Featured VideosArnott Air Suspension Promo01Good vs Bad Shock02How to Choose the Right Shocks03Stopping Distance04Monroe Promo05Sachs Nivomat Shocks06Guides & Articles Performance Suspension PartsOctober 29, 2015Coilovers Are Pricey - Why Would I Spend My...When first glancing through the Performance Coilover Kits section of our website, you may be put off by some of the prices you see.

However, I ordered two shock struts at one time but got each shipped separately, meaning pay for shipping separate. Not  a wise-cost effective deal for customers. Both shocks came free of damage, seems to be in working order and at a reasonable price. Installation it's easy if you know how to do car repairs, not for everybody. So far they working good, and hopefully will last long. I always check CARiD.com for parts and prices. They need to work out a system to avoid charging double for shipping though.

Installation was not a breeze though. The old nuts were rusted on and we could not cut them off because the new shocks did not come with new nuts  or grommets. Called the Caddy dealer, they told us that the new nuts were special order, and the size and description they gave didn't even come close to the nuts on the car. (Original nuts from the factory). Arnott should supply the nuts, as all replacement shocks come with new nuts and grommets. Will be calling Arnott to tell them that they make a good product, but like most companies now a days, if they can save a couple of cents, they will, at the consumer's expense.The nuts are not pictured in the photo's, so make sure you have new nuts if yours are rusted badly. Original shocks used allen to keep thee shaft from turning, Arnott uses Torx. CARiD delivered all they showed and promised.

When two close firing cylinders are exhausting on one cylinder bank, nothing is happening in the other bank, so connecting both pipes effectively enlarges the exhaust system, allowing these exhaust pulses to exit through both sides of the system. Exhaust flow is increased because both cylinder banks make use of both sides of the exhaust system, and increased exhaust flow equals more power.Show items:6090120Sort by:RecommendedPrice Low to HighPrice High to LowTop Rated ProductsMagnaFlow® Street Series Exhaust System(89 reviews)# sp598Street Series Exhaust System by MagnaFlow®.

While muffler designs may differ, all of our exhaust pipes are mandrel bent. Mandrel bending ensures smooth bends and maintains tube size and shape throughout the entire length. Tubes that aren’t mandrel bent can lose a percentage of their diameter in sharp bends, which creates restriction.Sound is just as important factor in an exhaust system purchase as increased power. That’s why each of our systems has been tested to make sure you get just the right exhaust note, so you’ll enjoy getting behind the wheel. Performance and sound are essential, but an exhaust system also has to be made of quality materials so it will last. All of our systems come in stainless steel or aluminized steel, for long lasting durability. Each includes stylish exhaust tip(s), usually made from stainless steel and highly polished for visual effect, but if you prefer something different, check out our selection of exhaust tips.
Most of the exhaust systems we have are “cat back” systems, meaning they include everything to replace the exhaust system behind the catalytic converter. This means your emissions system will be unaffected and your vehicle will still pass a smog check. However, if you do ever need to replace your catalytic converter, we can offer you a performance option that will properly reduce emissions, but with increased exhaust flow compared to your original factory converter. These converters have a monolithic honeycomb catalyst designed for maximum flow, and smoother flowing inlet and outlet joints.If you want to go even further to reduce exhaust restriction and gain power, then consider installing headers. Headers replace the factory exhaust manifolds, which usually flow poorly. An exhaust header has individual tubes for each exhaust port, allowing each exhaust pulse to flow unobstructed from the cylinder head. All tubes meet in a larger tube called a collector. The tubes on headers are usually larger in diameter than the runners on an exhaust manifold and the tubes are mandrel bent for gradual radius bends, which reduces restriction and increases exhaust flow.Featured VideosChip Foose's F10001Leah Pritchetts Challenger Hellcat02MagnaFlow at Monster Jam03The GRIDLIFE Experience 201704American Muscle05Borla & Ford F-150 Project06Ultimate Callout Challenge 201607Diesel Particulate Filter082016 Chevy Camaro Headers09Borla Cratemufflers Lead The Heard10Sema 2016 Recap Vibrant Performance11Camaro SS Varitune Axleback Exhaust122015 Max Performance Car Show132015-2017 Dodge Challenger14Flowmaster Racing Mufflers Silencers15Superbird Auto Club16Flowmasters 8 Hottest Mufflers17Supermaxx Headers Product Release18How Do You Want To Be Heard19Gibson Muffler20Flowmaster Muffler Silencers21Rattletrap Meets Winter22MagnaFlow Manufacturing23Borla Builds Excitement24MagnaFlow Production25Borla Exhaust Installation26MagnaFlow Evolution27Audi R8 V10 GT with Borla Exhaust28Flowmaster Charger Exhaust29Rock Hard Power30Marco Andretti Test Driving31Guides & Articles Performance Exhaust SystemsMay 17, 2016Here's A 'Tip': Exhaust Tips Are An Easy Way To...Performance exhaust systems give you improvements in power output, sound levels, and appearance, all in one package.

Some other sites had Gibson stainless steel exhaust systems, but when you did your research, the model number wasn't compatible. I checked the Gibson website to make sure that the product sold by CARiD was accurate.  It indeed was which was good. The price was the cheapest I could find on the web, plus it was shipped for free which was a bonus. Also Gibson had a rebate program special which was prominently advertised at the CARiD website which saved me another $25. All I can say that ordering from CARiD was effortless, quick, and well worth it. I think the product was shipped to me in less than 1 weeks time. That is pretty quick.EPosted by Erich (Tyler, TX) / June 27, 20172004 Toyota TacomaWas this review helpful for you?

Love the black and I threw the four inch tip on after and she purrs. But, found the hangers for the exhaust were dinky. The way it has no nipple on it is a joke. I had to drill holes in each hanger and put a cotter pin through it so it didn't fall off. Again. Hint at the new four inch tip that I order because the other one grinded down too nothing after dragging on the pavement. Not completely choked at the guys at CARiD. But MBRP needs to figure it out as well. CARiD has good service though you boys have made my truck look mint. Thanks.

The only issue on the installation I had was the removal of the old pipe. It took me about 2 hours laying in the driveway start to finish! The exhaust system sounds super tuff when you're outside the truck and on the inside it's got great tone and in my opinion does give a horrible droning noise at any speed.
