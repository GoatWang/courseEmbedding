Early career[edit]
Joe DiMenna started working as a research assistant for Marty Zweig in 1977 while still a college student. Having studied stocks and markets since his early teens, Joe started reading several market newsletters and found Marty Zweig's top rated "The Zweig Forecast" to be particularly intriguing and useful. As a Ph.D. in finance, Zweig's approach was unique and ahead of its time with the focus being on in depth economic and quantitative research using hard data. Zweig is credited with inventing numerous market indicators including things such as the Put/Call ratio and other important measures of investor sentiment. Several aphorisms that are still widely used such as "Don't fight the Fed," and Don't fight the tape," were originated with Marty. This inspired DiMenna to try to emulate some of Zweig's methods. After a few years of doing his own research, DiMenna sent a letter to Marty suggesting some market ideas and also asking for a recommendation to college. This correspondence resulted in Marty hiring Joe as his research assistant which was all about crunching numbers (mostly by hand) and digging into reams of data, often going back 50 or more years.
Professional[edit]
Upon graduating from college in 1980, DiMenna stayed with Marty and continued doing more and deeper market research, as well as beginning to work on stock selection techniques. At around this time, DiMenna started to edit a newsletter focusing on stock selection, and also formed a business with Marty that used market timing techniques to trade mutual funds. Having extensive experience with markets and stocks, DiMenna proposed to Zweig in 1983 the idea that they use their skills to build a money management platform in the form of a hedge fund. While common now, there were fewer than 10 hedge funds in existence at the time with a total amount of assets of several $100mm under management. That compares to there currently being over 10000 funds managing over $2 Trillion.[1] DiMenna with Zweig formed the first Zweig-DiMenna partnership in 1984 and Zweig-DiMenna International Limited, the first offshore fund, in 1987. The funds has had a long/short equity focus with macro risk management included. Joe DiMenna's role was portfolio manager responsible for stocks and other investments. Zweig was responsible for assessing changing market conditions. Together they formulated appropriate strategies which DiMenna managed.
In 1999, BusinessWeek profiled DiMenna as "one of the best stock-pickers no one has ever heard of," recognizing Zweig-DiMenna's 15-year annualized return, after fees, of 25%, vs. the 18.6% annualized total return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.[2]
In 2002, DiMenna was named "Entrepreneur of the Year" by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, an organization that promotes the teaching of business principles to students.
In 2007, Zweig-DiMenna International hedge fund was Absolute Return Magazine's "U.S. Equity Fund of the Year" in recognition of its 82.25% annual return which far outpaced its industry peers. The award is based on 3 year returns compared to volatility with high Sharpe ratio. Absolute Return Magazine also nominated the long / short equity fund for "Fund of the Year." [3] In 2008, the fund finished in the top 3 equity funds.[4]
In 2008, Alpha Magazine ranked DiMenna 13th on their list of Top Moneymakers noting his $450 million earnings in 2007 and double-digit annual returns between 2002 and 2007.[5]
Philanthropy[edit]
The DiMenna Foundation supports organizations in the arts, education, and those for the development of children. The Foundation has been a major supporter of the Harlem Children's Zone, College Summit, the New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the Robin Hood Foundation.[6]
The DiMenna Children's History Museum at The New-York Historical Society bears his name in recognition of his, and wife Diana's, $5 million lead donation in 2010. The museum is the first interactive space in the country for children to learn about history. .[7]
The DiMenna-Nyselius Library at Fairfield University bears his name in recognition of his $5 million donation in 1998 used to fund the expansion of the library. The DiMenna Center for Classical Music of the Orchestra of St. Luke's bears his name in recognition of his $5 million donation in 2008 used to create the new resource center.[8]
Education[edit]
DiMenna received a B.S. in Finance from the Fairfield University Dolan School of Business in 1980. He has served as a member of the Board of Trustees.[9]

Early career[edit]
Joe DiMenna started working as a research assistant for Marty Zweig in 1977 while still a college student. Having studied stocks and markets since his early teens, Joe started reading several market newsletters and found Marty Zweig's top rated "The Zweig Forecast" to be particularly intriguing and useful. As a Ph.D. in finance, Zweig's approach was unique and ahead of its time with the focus being on in depth economic and quantitative research using hard data. Zweig is credited with inventing numerous market indicators including things such as the Put/Call ratio and other important measures of investor sentiment. Several aphorisms that are still widely used such as "Don't fight the Fed," and Don't fight the tape," were originated with Marty. This inspired DiMenna to try to emulate some of Zweig's methods. After a few years of doing his own research, DiMenna sent a letter to Marty suggesting some market ideas and also asking for a recommendation to college. This correspondence resulted in Marty hiring Joe as his research assistant which was all about crunching numbers (mostly by hand) and digging into reams of data, often going back 50 or more years.
Professional[edit]
Upon graduating from college in 1980, DiMenna stayed with Marty and continued doing more and deeper market research, as well as beginning to work on stock selection techniques. At around this time, DiMenna started to edit a newsletter focusing on stock selection, and also formed a business with Marty that used market timing techniques to trade mutual funds. Having extensive experience with markets and stocks, DiMenna proposed to Zweig in 1983 the idea that they use their skills to build a money management platform in the form of a hedge fund. While common now, there were fewer than 10 hedge funds in existence at the time with a total amount of assets of several $100mm under management. That compares to there currently being over 10000 funds managing over $2 Trillion.[1] DiMenna with Zweig formed the first Zweig-DiMenna partnership in 1984 and Zweig-DiMenna International Limited, the first offshore fund, in 1987. The funds has had a long/short equity focus with macro risk management included. Joe DiMenna's role was portfolio manager responsible for stocks and other investments. Zweig was responsible for assessing changing market conditions. Together they formulated appropriate strategies which DiMenna managed.
In 1999, BusinessWeek profiled DiMenna as "one of the best stock-pickers no one has ever heard of," recognizing Zweig-DiMenna's 15-year annualized return, after fees, of 25%, vs. the 18.6% annualized total return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.[2]
In 2002, DiMenna was named "Entrepreneur of the Year" by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, an organization that promotes the teaching of business principles to students.
In 2007, Zweig-DiMenna International hedge fund was Absolute Return Magazine's "U.S. Equity Fund of the Year" in recognition of its 82.25% annual return which far outpaced its industry peers. The award is based on 3 year returns compared to volatility with high Sharpe ratio. Absolute Return Magazine also nominated the long / short equity fund for "Fund of the Year." [3] In 2008, the fund finished in the top 3 equity funds.[4]
In 2008, Alpha Magazine ranked DiMenna 13th on their list of Top Moneymakers noting his $450 million earnings in 2007 and double-digit annual returns between 2002 and 2007.[5]
Philanthropy[edit]
The DiMenna Foundation supports organizations in the arts, education, and those for the development of children. The Foundation has been a major supporter of the Harlem Children's Zone, College Summit, the New York-Presbyterian Hospital and the Robin Hood Foundation.[6]
The DiMenna Children's History Museum at The New-York Historical Society bears his name in recognition of his, and wife Diana's, $5 million lead donation in 2010. The museum is the first interactive space in the country for children to learn about history. .[7]
The DiMenna-Nyselius Library at Fairfield University bears his name in recognition of his $5 million donation in 1998 used to fund the expansion of the library. The DiMenna Center for Classical Music of the Orchestra of St. Luke's bears his name in recognition of his $5 million donation in 2008 used to create the new resource center.[8]
Education[edit]
DiMenna received a B.S. in Finance from the Fairfield University Dolan School of Business in 1980. He has served as a member of the Board of Trustees.[9]
Personal life[edit]
DiMenna is married to Diana DiMenna, who is a documentary film maker and Broadway producer, and is the father of two daughters. He is a polo player and former chess champion. DiMenna and his wife are art collectors with a focus on African tribal art, abstract expressionism, rare books, and U.S. historical documents.[10]

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT COMPARABLE The performance data presented on the Website reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings, and net figures reflect the deduction of expenses, management fees and incentive fees and allocations.
 The Firm believes that the performance shown on the Website was generated with an investment philosophy and methodology similar to that described in the funds' respective Confidential Offering Circulars and Private Offering Memoranda and that the Firm would expect to use in the future. Future investments, however, will be made under different economic conditions and in different securities and may be made using different investment strategies than were used during the times discussed herein. Furthermore, the performance discussed herein reflects investment of limited funds for a limited period of time and does not reflect performance in different economic or market cycles. You should not assume that any fund that the Firm advises will experience returns, if any, comparable to those described herein. Past performance does not indicate future returns. The performance results have not been compiled, reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. Results for the current year are based on the internal books and records of each fund and are subject to adjustment when that fund's financial statements for the current year are audited.
 The Firm believes that comparing each fund's performance to any single market index or other benchmark is or may be inappropriate. These indices and benchmarks are provided for comparative purposes, but only as examples of general market performance. Unlike these indices and benchmarks, each fund's portfolio may contain options (including covered and uncovered puts and calls) and other derivative securities, futures and other commodity interests and currencies, and may include short sales of securities, margin trading, securities of smaller capitalization companies and types of securities that are different than those reflected in these indices and benchmarks, and is not as diversified as these indices and benchmarks. Due to the differences between the composition of a fund's portfolio and these indices and benchmarks, the Firm cautions potential investors that no such index or other benchmark is directly comparable to any fund.

Through the years, their partnership flourished and they formed Zweig-DiMenna International Limited in 1984.The duo was successful in producing strong returns for their investors over the years. Zweig-DiMenna Partners was up almost 90% for the last 5 years as of early 2011.
