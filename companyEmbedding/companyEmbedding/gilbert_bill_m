MAILING ADDRESS FOR PAYMENTS
Town of Gilbert
Utility Department
PO Box 52653
Phoenix, AZ 85072-2653 
Utility Service Deposit
New accounts with the Town of Gilbert will be assessed the minimum deposit indicated below.  A higher deposit may be required based on prior payment history. Deposits may be refunded and applied to the outstanding balance after 12 months of on-time payments or will be applied at the time the account closes.
Eligible customers may be able to waive the deposit by signing up for Autopay.






Minimum Deposit




Single Family Residential Accounts


$200




Commercial or Multi-Family Residential Accounts


$200 or average two month bill, whichever is higher





The Town of Gilbert Utility Department may require deposits on any existing accounts that indicate potential financial liability to the Town.  Risk factors may include, but are not limited to, a history of late payments, returned mail and returned payments.  The maximum deposit that may be charged is 2.5 times the highest monthly bill within the last 12 months.
 


 
Activation Fee
There is a one time activation fee assessed for starting utility service. This charge is included on your first utility billing statement.
Account Activation Fees

Service requested with at least 1 business day advance notice. $15 + tax
Same day Service. $30 + tax 
Service charge after hours. $75 + tax 


Payment of Utility Bill
Because all charges are for services already received, we ask that payment be made immediately upon receipt of the statement. Accounts are considered delinquent 20 days past the bill date and late fees may be assessed at any time thereafter. The fee is 1.5% of the past due balance, with a $5 minimum. It is your responsibility to ensure that payment is made in time to be processed before late fees are imposed. 
Utility Service is subject to disconnection if payment is not received by the 45th day after the bill date. At that time a fee of $25 + tax will be charged. Water service may not be reestablished without payment of the entire outstanding balance and any associated fees and deposits.

Please do not attempt to activate your own service. Any tampering with Town property may result in a $100 tampering fee and prosecution of the responsible party on the account for theft and criminal damage. This includes any damage to the meter, turning on water that has been disconnected or bypassing the meter to obtain water.
An unpaid utility bill may be transferred to another Town of Gilbert utility account established by the same customer. Non payment of a final bill will be referred to a collection agency and a collection fee may be assessed.
The Town of Gilbert has a variety of payment options available to you.

AutoPay
    The Town of Gilbert offers an automatic payment plan through your checking or savings account. You never have to worry about paying your Town of Gilbert Utility Bill on time again. By enrolling, your bank will automatically withdraw the funds each month for your Utility Bill payment.  Go to the online Autopay Form.


Online payments
    Sign up for account access on our website and you can make your Visa, MasterCard, or AmericanExpress payment online. Payments made online will now post to your account immediately.  Go to Pay Your Bill.


Phone
    You may make a Visa, MasterCard, or AmericanExpress payment using our automated attendant payment feature 24 hours a day at (480) 503-6800.


Mail
    If you choose to mail your payment, please use the convenient return envelope included in your billing statement. Please allow 3-5 days for the payment to be received and processed.


Drop Boxes
    Payments may be placed in one of our dropboxes by 7:00 am for processing that day. The dropboxes are located at 50 E. Civic Center Drive and at the South Area Service Center - 4760 S. Greenfield Road.


In Person
    Utility payment can be made in person at our office located at 90 E. Civic Center Drive. Office hours are Monday – Thursday 7am – 6pm.  The office is closed on Fridays, weekends and holidays. 

 

 
Returned Check Fee
If a payment (check, credit card, AutoPay, etc.) is returned to the Town of Gilbert by your financial institution, we will require immediate repayment and a $25 fee will be assessed. 
In addition, service may be disconnected immediately if the payment was originally made to prevent services from being disconnected or to reestablish disconnected services. 
All other returned payments will require reimbursement within seven days. The repayment, including all associated fees, must be made by cash, cashier’s check or a money order.
