Bourne Lent Asset Management, Inc.
Established 1983

Donald W. Bourne Sr. Chairman and Founder
                1929 - 2013
Donald Winthrop Bourne, known to many as Poppie, Coach, Lou, Mr. Wall St., Mayor,
    Dad, Mr. B, Senior, The Champ or Don, was born in Brooklyn, NY, May 10, 1929.  He
    graduated from Glen Ridge High School, Glen Ridge, NJ, in 1947. He earned a degree
    in Business from the school of Commerce at Washington and Lee University, Lexington
    VA, in 1951. On July 7, 1956, Don married June Alice Bloomfield also a resident of
    Glen Ridge.  Don had a life-long career in finance, beginning at Merrill Lynch in
    New York. He then worked at Scudder Stevens and Clarke, Independent Investment Advisors,
    and F. Eberstadt. After commuting into New York City for the better part of 45 years,
    he established his own investment company, Bourne Management, Inc., in Montclair,
    NJ, in May of 1983. Bourne Management, Inc. then evolved into Bourne, Stenstrom,
    Lent, Asset Management, Inc. with offices in Montclair, NJ; New York, NY; Pawling,
    NY; and Yarmouth, ME, with Don heading the Yarmouth office until his death. 
Don and June raised their family in Glen Ridge, where Don volunteered for many years
    as a little league coach, a town councilman, a member of the historical society and
    eventually Mayor of Glen Ridge. In 1989, he and June moved to Maine where they had
    been spending summers since 1966. He enjoyed sailing his cat boat Dixie Bull, adventuring
    in their whimsical, multicolored tug boat Lil’ Toot and golfing at Falmouth Golf
    Club where he was still a member.  He and June have cultivated friendships and continued
    to volunteer in worthwhile organizations such as the Yarmouth Historical Society
    and the Thompson Ice House in South Bristol, Maine. South Bristol is the hub where
    his children and grandchildren have spent many wonderful summers, holidays and vacations.
He leaves behind his wife June of 57 years, daughters Linda Bourne (Guilford, CT)
    and Lisa Stickle and her husband David(Monmouth Beach, NJ), son  Donald, Jr. (Sherman,
    CT), and grandchildren: David, Matthew, Michael, Kevin, Stephen, Kelly, and Donald,
    and many, many extended family and friends. He passed quietly on the sunny deck of
    his home in South Bristol with the sea breeze in his face and a sailboat gliding
    by. 
Don will be sorely missed.
Fair winds and a following seas, until we meet again.

“Fair Winds” and “Following Seas” has evolved  into  a single phrase which is often
        used as a nautical blessing

What are analysts saying about Caterpillar stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Caterpillar stock: 
1. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "hard to imagine a robust surge" in the near term. Nevertheless, the mining and energy sector as a whole has "passed the lows," and the company is well positioned to capitalize on its status as a leader in capital equipment and engines — when an upturn eventually arrives.Meanwhile, Caterpillar's cost-cutting initiatives, headcount reductions, improved sourcing and shuttering or consolidating more than 30 factories will reduce fixed costs by nearly $2 billion, the analyst continued. Also, the company can save another $750 million from the closings of two factories in Belgium and Illinois while incentive compensation fell by more than $1 billion since peaking in 2014 at $1.3 billion.Last, Caterpillar's new CEO Jim Umpleby is likely to focus on profitability, free cash flow, and returns as opposed to the recent CEO Doug Oberhelman who focused on penetrating new markets and gaining market share. As such, the company should now be viewed as "a whole different animal." (7/24/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Caterpillar’s May sales rose 8%, an improvement from 1% growth witnessed in the last two months thanks to continual improvement in Asia Pacific. It remains to be seen whether this momentum will be sustained as even though commodity prices have improved lately, it is not sufficient to drive a relevant increase in short-term demand for new equipment. Caterpillar guides revenues in the range of $38–$41 billion and earnings of $3.75 per share for 2017, a 2% and 10% year–over-year growth, respectively. In construction, Asia Pacific is showing promise while leading indicators of U.S. construction signal robust conditions ahead. The company’s efforts to reduce costs will help boost margins. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the Zacks sub industry. Also, it has a positive record of earnings surprises." (7/14/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Cost cuts continue to benefit margins despite ongoing market weakness. 4Q16 earnings, ex. adjustments, were better than expected on favorable decremental margins in Construction and E&T versus modeled expectations. With FX remaining a headwind CAT lowered the mid-point of the 2017 revenue guide to $37.5bln (prior: ~$38bln) resulting in EPS of $2.90 (Consensus: $3.06). Shares continue to trade above 30x earnings, a premium to prior cycles." (1/27/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (7.04% upside)
