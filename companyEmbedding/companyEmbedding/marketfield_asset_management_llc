								Marketfield Asset Management LLC ("Marketfield") is a registered investment advisor that offers discretionary portfolio management for private and institutional clients, typically as advisor or subadvisor to funds and products. The firm is an absolute return manager that attempts to provide returns on capital substantially in excess of the risk free rate rather than matching any particular index or external benchmark. The products we manage are intended to offer the portfolio flexibility typically associated with private partnerships with the structural advantages of more traditional, regulated products.

Investment Philosophy


						The foundation of our investment process is the managers’ constant and thorough assessment of general macroeconomic and business conditions. Recognizing these processes is paramount if a manager is to avoid the types of risk that can permanently impair a portfolio and remain able to capitalize on the opportunities that regularly follow periods of severe distress. The goal is to identify businesses and other investment media that will be most affected by large scale, external economic forces. The senior management team at Marketfield has a long public record of anticipating and responding appropriately, as macroeconomic conditions evolve from one cycle to the next.
					

						Over time, we have shown an ability to act appropriately in a wide variety of market conditions and we believe that the willingness to change both our intellectual and portfolio positioning is a key factor in delivering acceptable returns to our clients. We communicate our thoughts constantly both through our written research and direct dialogue maintaining an unusual level of access to senior management.
					

						The products we manage are structured with very broad charters in recognition of the widely different asset and security types that can exhibit leadership from one cycle to the next. Our style, while encompassing a wide array of potential asset classes, will normally concentrate capital in those specific assets that stand to derive the most benefit (or harm in the case of short positions) from the macroeconomic forces that we anticipate. Although our mandate is necessarily broad in any particular cycle, we are likely to utilize only a small portion of the allowable range of instruments. 
					

						MARKETFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT® is the name used by Marketfield for investment advisory services.

Fund Objective: Seeks capital appreciation.







Investment Strategy and Process
 The Fund seeks long-term growth of capital above that of the broad
                                                        equity market over a full market cycle, with volatility that is lower
                                                        than that of the broad equity market. Correlation between the Fund
                                                        and the broad equity market may vary considerably over the course
                                                        of an investment cycle.
                                                    
The Fund has a broad investment charter that allows it to allocate its
                                                        assets among investments in equity securities, fixed-income instruments,
                                                        commodities, futures, options, and other investment companies, including
                                                        ETFs. Additionally, with respect to 50% of the Fund's net assets,
                                                        the Fund may engage in short sales of securities to profit from an
                                                        anticipated decline in the price of the security sold short.

                                            Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future 
                                            results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an
                                            investor's shares, when redemmed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current 
                                            performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data

                                            Performance data shown w/sales charges reflects the Class A maximum sales 
                                            charge of 5.50% and the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 1.00% for Class C Shares.
                                            Performance data shown at NAV does not reflect the deduction of any sales load or CSDS. 
                                            If reflected, the load or fee would reduce the performance quoted.                                            
                                        

                                            Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and expense structures. 
                                            The performance figures for Class I shares reflect the historical performance of the then-existing 
                                            shares of MainStay Marketfield Fund (the predecessor to the Fund, for which the Adviser served as 
                                            the investment sub-advisor) for periods from October 5, 2012 to April 8, 2016. The performance figures 
                                            for Class I shares also reflect the historical performance of the then-existing shares of the 
                                            predecessor fund to MainStay Marketfield Fund (which was subject to a different fee structure, 
                                            and for which a predecessor entity to the Adviser served as the investment adviser) for periods 
                                            prior to October 5, 2012. The returns in the table below for periods prior to October 5, 2012 have 
                                            been calculated using the expenses of the predecessor fund to the MainStay Marketfield Fund. 
                                            Performance figures for Class A and Class C shares, first offered on 
                                            October 5, 2012, include the historical performance of Class I shares through October 4, 2012 
                                            and are adjusted to reflect differences in fees and expenses. Performance figures for Class R6 shares, 
                                            first offered on June 17, 2013, include the historical performance of Class I shares through 
                                            June 16, 2013. Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and 
                                            expense structures. The returns in the table below for 
                                            periods prior to October 5, 2012 have been calculated using the expenses of the predecessor fund 
                                            to the MainStay Marketfield Fund. Performance data for the classes varies based on differences 
                                            in their fee and expense structures. Unadjusted, the performance for the newer classes would 
                                            likely have been different because of differences in certain fees and expenses attributable 
                                            to each share class.

Before You Invest

            The Fund invests in small and mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. 
            The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency
            risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments
            in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise.  This risk is usually greater for longer-term
            debt securities. Investment by the Fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss
            to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities
            involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased
            susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund regularly makes short sales of securities, which involve
            the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested, however a mutual fund investor’s risk is limited
            to the amount invested in a fund. Investing in ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional
            mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of the shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value 
            ("NAV"), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange
            in which they trade, which may impact a Funds ability to sell its shares. Derivatives involve special risks including
            correlation, counterparty, liquidity, operational, accounting and tax risks. These risks, in certain cases, may be 
            greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. The Fund may experience a portfolio turnover rate
            of over 100% and may generate short-term capital gains which are taxable.
        


Disclosure
1. POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to
                    revision and include the maximum sales charge.
2. No sales charge applies to Class A share investments of $1,000,000 or more, but a CDSC
                    of 1% may be imposed on certain redemptions of such shares within one year of the date of purchase.

3. Class R6 shares are available only to certain retirement plans.
4. Option delta is the relationship between the option price and the underlying price, 
                      which reflects the sensitivity of the price of the option to changes in the price of the underlying.
Investment Definitions
The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring
                    large-cap U.S. stock-market performance. Index results assume the reinvestment of all capital gain and
                    dividend distributions. The securities holdings and volatility of the Fund differ significantly from
                    the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index. An investment cannot be made directly into an index.



                    Correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which the movements of two variables (stock/option/convertible 
                    prices of returns) are related.

Fund Objective: Seeks capital appreciation.







Investment Strategy and Process
 The Fund seeks long-term growth of capital above that of the broad
                                                        equity market over a full market cycle, with volatility that is lower
                                                        than that of the broad equity market. Correlation between the Fund
                                                        and the broad equity market may vary considerably over the course
                                                        of an investment cycle.
                                                    
The Fund has a broad investment charter that allows it to allocate its
                                                        assets among investments in equity securities, fixed-income instruments,
                                                        commodities, futures, options, and other investment companies, including
                                                        ETFs. Additionally, with respect to 50% of the Fund's net assets,
                                                        the Fund may engage in short sales of securities to profit from an
                                                        anticipated decline in the price of the security sold short.

                                            Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future 
                                            results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an
                                            investor's shares, when redemmed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current 
                                            performance of the fund may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Performance data 
                                            current to the most recent month end may be obtained by calling 800-311-MKTD (311-6583). 
                                            
                                            Performance data shown w/sales charges reflects the Class A maximum sales 
                                            charge of 5.50% and the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 1.00% for Class C Shares.
                                            Performance data shown at NAV does not reflect the deduction of any sales load or CSDS. 
                                            If reflected, the load or fee would reduce the performance quoted.                                            
                                        

                                            Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and expense structures. 
                                            The performance figures for Class I shares reflect the historical performance of the then-existing 
                                            shares of MainStay Marketfield Fund (the predecessor to the Fund, for which the Adviser served as 
                                            the investment sub-advisor) for periods from October 5, 2012 to April 8, 2016. The performance figures 
                                            for Class I shares also reflect the historical performance of the then-existing shares of the 
                                            predecessor fund to MainStay Marketfield Fund (which was subject to a different fee structure, 
                                            and for which a predecessor entity to the Adviser served as the investment adviser) for periods 
                                            prior to October 5, 2012. The returns in the table below for periods prior to October 5, 2012 have 
                                            been calculated using the expenses of the predecessor fund to the MainStay Marketfield Fund. 
                                            Performance figures for Class A and Class C shares, first offered on 
                                            October 5, 2012, include the historical performance of Class I shares through October 4, 2012 
                                            and are adjusted to reflect differences in fees and expenses. Performance figures for Class R6 shares, 
                                            first offered on June 17, 2013, include the historical performance of Class I shares through 
                                            June 16, 2013. Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and 
                                            expense structures. The returns in the table below for 
                                            periods prior to October 5, 2012 have been calculated using the expenses of the predecessor fund 
                                            to the MainStay Marketfield Fund. Performance data for the classes varies based on differences 
                                            in their fee and expense structures. Unadjusted, the performance for the newer classes would 
                                            likely have been different because of differences in certain fees and expenses attributable 
                                            to each share class.

Before You Invest

            The Fund invests in small and mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. 
            The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency
            risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments
            in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise.  This risk is usually greater for longer-term
            debt securities. Investment by the Fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss
            to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities
            involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased
            susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund regularly makes short sales of securities, which involve
            the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested, however a mutual fund investor’s risk is limited
            to the amount invested in a fund. Investing in ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional
            mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of the shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value 
            ("NAV"), an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange
            in which they trade, which may impact a Funds ability to sell its shares. Derivatives involve special risks including
            correlation, counterparty, liquidity, operational, accounting and tax risks. These risks, in certain cases, may be 
            greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. The Fund may experience a portfolio turnover rate
            of over 100% and may generate short-term capital gains which are taxable.
        


Disclosure
1. POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to
                    revision and include the maximum sales charge.
2. No sales charge applies to Class A share investments of $1,000,000 or more, but a CDSC
                    of 1% may be imposed on certain redemptions of such shares within one year of the date of purchase.

3. Class R6 shares are available only to certain retirement plans.
4. Option delta is the relationship between the option price and the underlying price, 
                      which reflects the sensitivity of the price of the option to changes in the price of the underlying.
Investment Definitions
The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring
                    large-cap U.S. stock-market performance. Index results assume the reinvestment of all capital gain and
                    dividend distributions. The securities holdings and volatility of the Fund differ significantly from
                    the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index. An investment cannot be made directly into an index.



                    Correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which the movements of two variables (stock/option/convertible

MainStay Investments and Marketfield Asset Management to Partner on 
      Marketfield Fund




MainStay Continues to Broaden Product Lineup through Fund Adoption 
      and New Sub-Advisory Relationship with Marketfield Asset Management






July 02, 2012 09:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MainStay Investments, a New York Life company, today announced the 
      formation of a new subadvisory partnership with Marketfield Asset 
      Management (“Marketfield”) and the proposed adoption of The Marketfield 
      Fund (MFLDX) to the MainStay Family of Funds. The flexible allocation 
      fund, with $2 billion in assets, will be reorganized into the MainStay 
      Funds and become the “MainStay Marketfield Fund” pending shareholder 
      approval. MainStay Investments will become the investment advisor to the 
      new fund and Marketfield will be sub-advisor to the fund. Marketfield 
      will continue to be responsible for the day to day portfolio management 
      of the fund.
    


      Founded in 2006 and led by President and Portfolio Manager Michael 
      Aronstein and Michael Shaoul, the Chairman and CEO, New York-based 
      Marketfield manages the Fund with a fundamental, macroeconomic 
      investment process. The Marketfield Fund has ranked in the top quartile 
      of Morningstar’s long-short category over the one year and three year 
      periods ended May 31, 2012, and was rated 5-stars overall by Morningstar 
      as of May 31, 2012.
    

      “We are very pleased to welcome Marketfield to our team of diversified 
      and independent investment managers,” said Stephen Fisher, president of 
      the MainStay Funds. “The Marketfield investment team’s top-down 
      macro-economic approach, expressed primarily through liquid publicly 
      traded instruments, complements and enhances our existing fund family 
      offerings. We believe that the MainStay Marketfield Fund will be a key 
      driver for the continued growth of MainStay into the future.”
    

      “Our team is very excited about the opportunities presented by this new 
      partnership with MainStay Investments,” said Marketfield’s Michael 
      Aronstein. “We believe the operational and distribution resources 
      offered by MainStay will play a key role in our future growth while 
      enabling our team to remain focused on the execution of our investment 
      process. The Marketfield Fund remains committed to the core principles 
      that have guided us over the last five years: a broad investment mandate 
      driven by our own internal proprietary macroeconomic and fundamental 
      research, transparency, and liquidity. It’s a model that has worked 
      effectively for us and one that we know is resonating with our 
      shareholders more than ever in this volatile economic climate.”
    

      Aronstein and Shaoul bring over 50 years of combined investment 
      experience to The Marketfield Fund, and are regular contributors to 
      Bloomberg TV and other media outlets. Prior to joining Marketfield, Mr. 
      Aronstein served in senior roles providing independent macroeconomic and 
      strategic advice to professional investors as well as founding a 
      discretionary commodity management firm. In addition to his role at 
      Marketfield, Mr. Shaoul serves as chief executive officer of Oscar Gruss 
      and Son Incorporated. Previously, Mr. Shaoul managed a Manhattan-based 
      real estate investment and management company.

*How Barron’s Ranks the Fund Families: To qualify for the 
      Lipper/Barron’s Fund Survey, a fund family must have at least three 
      funds in Lipper’s general U.S.-stock category, one in world equity 
      (which combines global and international funds), one mixed-equity fund 
      (which holds stocks and bonds), at least two taxable-bond funds, and one 
      tax-exempt offering. Each fund’s returns are adjusted for 12b-1 fees. 
      Fund loads, or sales charges, aren’t included in the calculation of 
      returns, either. Each fund’s return is measured against those of all 
      funds in its Lipper category, such as, say, small-cap value. That leads 
      to a percentile ranking, with 100 the highest and 1 the lowest, which is 
      then weighted by asset size, relative to the fund family’s other assets 
      in its general classification, world equity, for instance. If a family’s 
      biggest funds do well, that boosts its overall ranking. Poor performance 
      in a big fund would have the opposite effect. Finally, the score is 
      multiplied by the weighting of its general classification, as determined 
      by the entire Lipper universe of funds. The category weightings for the 
      one-year results: general equity, 38.04%; world equity, 12.77%; mixed 
      equity, 17.36%; taxable bonds, 27.43%; and tax-exempt bonds, 4.40%. The 
      category weightings for the five-year results: general equity, 40.12%; 
      world equity, 12.32%; mixed equity, 17.30%; taxable bonds, 25.56%; and 
      tax-exempt bonds, 4.70%. The category weightings for the 10-year 
      results: general equity, 41.89%; world equity, 12.30%; mixed equity, 
      14.44%; taxable bonds, 25.99%; and tax-exempt bonds, 5.38%. The scoring: 
      Say a company has a fund in the general U.S. equity category with $50 
      million in assets that accounts for half of the company’s assets in that 
      category. Its ranking is the 75th percentile. The first calculation 
      would be 75 x 0.50, which comes to 37.5. That score is then multiplied 
      by 38.04%, general equity’s overall weighting in Lipper’s universe. So 
      it would be 37.5 x 0.3804, which totals 14.265. Similar calculations are 
      done for each fund in the study. Then, all the numbers are added up for 
      a total score. The fund family with the highest score wins, both for 
      every category and overall. The same process is repeated for the five- 
      and 10-year rankings based on their weightings. Ranking data is from 
      Lipper. Source: Barron’s, 2/6/12. Overall, MainStay Funds ranked seven 
      for the one-year period, eight for the five-year period, and three for 
      the 10-year period ended December 31, 2011, out of 58, 53, and 45 fund 
      families, respectively.


      **Based on revenue as reported by “Fortune 500 ranked within 
      Industries, Insurance: Life, Health (Mutual),” Fortune magazine, 
      May 21, 2012.
    

Morningstar Rating For each fund with at least a three-year 
      history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a 
      Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in 
      a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, 
      loads, and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward 
      variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in 
      each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the 
      next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars, and the 
      next 10% receive one star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived 
      from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 
      three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. 
      Funds with less than three years of performance history are not rated.
    

Morningstar Percent Rank in Category This is the fund’s 
      total-return percentile rank for the specified time period relative to 
      all funds that have the same Morningstar category. The highest (or most 
      favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) 
      percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will 
      always receive a rank of 1. Percentile ranks within categories are most 
      useful in those categories that have a large number of funds.
    

      Marketfield Fund rated five stars overall and five stars for the 
      three-year period ending 5/31/12 from among 81 Long-Short Equity Funds. 
      Morningstar percentile ranks for the one- and three-year periods are 
      from among 179 and 79 Long-Short Equity funds, respectively.
    

Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance 
      is no guarantee of future results. Due to market volatility, current 
      performance may be less or higher than the figures shown. Investment 
      return and principal value will fluctuate so that upon redemption, 
      shares may be worth more or less than their original cost. For 
      performance information current to the most recent month-end, please

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
Bank of America, N.A. and the U.S. Trust Company of Delaware (collectively the "Bank") do not serve in a fiduciary capacity with respect to all products or services.

Marketfield Asset Management







































								Marketfield Asset Management LLC ("Marketfield") is a registered investment advisor that offers discretionary portfolio management for private and institutional clients, typically as advisor or subadvisor to funds and products. The firm is an absolute return manager that attempts to provide returns on capital substantially in excess of the risk free rate rather than matching any particular index or external benchmark. The products we manage are intended to offer the portfolio flexibility typically associated with private partnerships with the structural advantages of more traditional, regulated products.
								MARKETFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT®  MARKETFIELD FUND®
							












Investment Philosophy


						The foundation of our investment process is the managers’ constant and thorough assessment of general macroeconomic and business conditions. Recognizing these processes is paramount if a manager is to avoid the types of risk that can permanently impair a portfolio and remain able to capitalize on the opportunities that regularly follow periods of severe distress. The goal is to identify businesses and other investment media that will be most affected by large scale, external economic forces. The senior management team at Marketfield has a long public record of anticipating and responding appropriately, as macroeconomic conditions evolve from one cycle to the next.
					

						Over time, we have shown an ability to act appropriately in a wide variety of market conditions and we believe that the willingness to change both our intellectual and portfolio positioning is a key factor in delivering acceptable returns to our clients. We communicate our thoughts constantly both through our written research and direct dialogue maintaining an unusual level of access to senior management.
					

						The products we manage are structured with very broad charters in recognition of the widely different asset and security types that can exhibit leadership from one cycle to the next. Our style, while encompassing a wide array of potential asset classes, will normally concentrate capital in those specific assets that stand to derive the most benefit (or harm in the case of short positions) from the macroeconomic forces that we anticipate. Although our mandate is necessarily broad in any particular cycle, we are likely to utilize only a small portion of the allowable range of instruments. 
					

						MARKETFIELD ASSET MANAGEMENT® is the name used by Marketfield for investment advisory services.
