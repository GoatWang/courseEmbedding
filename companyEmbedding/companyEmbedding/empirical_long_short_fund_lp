Empirical Study on Price Momentum Strategy for Long, Short, and Long/Short Equity PortfoliosOptimal Rebalancing Period and Optimal SizeSusana Yu and Avner Wolf The authors start by observing that the optimal holding periods for long, short, and long/short equity portfolios must vary with transaction costs. The optimal holding period ranges from six to nine months, depending upon the type of portfolios being considered. Optimal efficiency occurs in portfolios containing between 20 and 80 securities, while efficiency is compromised in portfolios consisting of more than 100 stocks. They show that adjusted short and long/short equity portfolios' returns exhibit graphical patterns similar to the ones in the original short and long/short equity portfolios; however, these adjusted portfolio returns are amplified.

Interdisciplinary Management Research V THE EMPIRICAL STUDY OF EQUITY LONG ONLY HEDGE FUNDS PERFORMANCE IN 2007 - 2008 Izabela Pruchnicka-Grabias11Warsaw School of Economics, Poland ________________________________________________________________AbstractThe purpose of the research is to measure the investment results of hedge funds in 2007 and 2008 that is during the  bull and the bear market. The S&P500  index was used as a benchmark. It was shown that the majority of  institutions whose aim is to generate absolute rates of return, and what  refers to it,  to generate better rates of  return than traditional  investments irrespective of the market situation, broke this rule. Such measures were taken into consideration as: rates of return,  risk  measured  by  standard  deviation,  risk  measured  by  beta,  the  level  of  alpha,  the correlation of the examined funds with traditional assets and the Sharpe ratio.The research presented in  the paper  is a  part of  the wider  research conducted by the author for over  200 hedge  funds  divided  into  different  investment  strategies.  The  paper  deals  with  20 hedge funds chosen  at  random  from those which applied the  equity  long  only strategy  in  the examined period.JEL classification: G11, G15, G32 Keywords: hedge funds, investments________________________________________________________________IntroductionTraditional  investments  (like  stocks or  bonds) results  are compared  to certain benchmarks that are usually stock or bond indexes. This kind of approach is not used by  hedge funds managers. In  this case, the aim of an investment  is not to achieve the rate of income better than the market but an absolute and attractive rate of  income  no matter  what  the situation  on  the global  financial  market  is. These institutions should be characterized by the risk directly deriving from the strategy  used  by  them,  not  from  the  market  situation.    The  factor  that differentiates  a  hedge  fund  from  other  hedge  funds  is  the  level  of  alpha coefficient.S.J. Brown, W.N. Goetzmann and R.G. Ibbotson examined the off-shore hedge fund industry over the period 1989 through 1995 using a database that includes both defunct  and  currently  operating  funds.  They  come to  the  conclusion that the industry is characterized by high attrition rates and low covariance with the U.S.  stock  market.  Besides,  offshore  funds  as  a  group  have  positive  risk-adjusted performance when measured  by  Sharpe  ratios  and  by  Jensen’s  alpha. 481


Interdisciplinary Management Research V They also point that little public information is available about the investment strategies  and  specialization  of  these  mangers.1  As  it  is  shown  beneath,  the author’s conclusions about hedge funds performance differ from this research. They let assume that hedge funds are no longer as good tools for making money as they used to be a few years ago.1. The aim and the scope of the research The research  presented  in  the paper was  done  on  the basis  of  20  hedge funds that use equity long only strategies. They were chosen at random from the data base  prepared  by  BarclayHedge  and  Global  Fund  Technologies  which comprises about 2000 hedge funds applying different investment strategies. The aim of the research is to measure the investments results of hedge funds in 2007 and 2008  that  is  during  the bull  and  the  bear  market. The S&P500  index  was used as  a benchmark. It was  shown that the majority of institutions whose  aim is  to  generate  absolute rates  of  return,  and  what  refers  to it,  generating better rates of return  than traditional investments irrespective  of the market situation, thus also during the bear market, broke this rule. Such measures were taken into consideration  as:  rates  of  return,  risk  measured  by  standard  deviation,  risk measured by beta, the level of alpha, the correlation of the examined funds with traditional assets and the Sharpe ratio.Given the fact that the paper was prepared at the end of 2008, data from January 2007  until  November  2008  were  taken  into  consideration.  It let  examine  the results of hedge funds both  during  favorable  market  conditions  and during the bear market on global financial markets. In the first part of the paper the author gives the detailed characteristics of investment strategies used by the examined hedge funds.2. Hedge funds investment results measurement – focus on theory All  hedge  funds claim  to  do  something highly  exclusive  and  proprietary and anxiously guard their trading secrets. Although transparency has improved with the arrival of institutional investors, hedge fund investors are seldom told what exactly goes on inside the black box. As a result, it can sometimes be very hard to properly assess the risk-return characteristics of a fund.2 Apart from standard characteristics like rates of return, standard deviation, correlation, hedge funds’ performance is usually measured  by  beta  and alpha. The overall measure used in this  industry  is  the  Sharpe ratio  which  covers  both  risk and rates  of  return. The  paper  does  not  concentrate  on  the  idea  of  these  measures,  however  the 1 For details see: S.J. Brown, W.N. Goetzmann, R.G. Ibbotson, Offshore Hedge Funds: Survival & Performance 1989 – 1995, p. 1 – 20.2 H.M. Kat, H.P. Palaro, Who needs hedge funds? A Copula-Based Approach to Hedge Fund Return Replication, Cass Business School, City of London, November 23, 2005, p. 7.482


Interdisciplinary Management Research V author will give a brief point on the most important things concerning beta and alpha, so as to make the empirical results more understandable. In a nutshell, beta is a measure of a fund’s amount of dependence on the return of  the  market.  The  concept  is  rooted in  portfolio  theory pioneered  by Harry Markowitz in the 1950s, which has evolved to express the relationship between risky assets, such as stocks, and the market (Tran; 2006, 51). Hedge funds offer three types of beta benefits: (Gregoriou et al.; 2005, 33) •Traditional  beta  benefits  emanating  from exposure  to stock  and bond returns•Beta  benefits  emanating  from  exposure to  other  risk  factors  in  equity markets, such as small-cap versus large-cap spread, value versus growth spread, or implied volatility, and in bond markets, such as term spread, credit spread, or bond returns volatility •Other  alternate  beta  benefits,  such  as  commodity  price  levels  or currency rates. The beta measure is connected with a risk premium that is a part of the CAPM.3Hedge funds are supposed to be free from the market, free from its vagaries and fluctuations and risks.  The  values  of their beta are supposed to  be  very low or near  zero.  For  a  fund  manager  to  achieve  such  a  feat,  he  or  she  must  have exceptional  skills  or  talent.  That  is  why  alpha  is  often  claimed  to  be synonymous with a portfolio manager’s talent or skills.43. Hedge funds assets and investment strategies The examined  hedge  funds  have  various  amount  of  assets  under  management (see chart 1). It is worth emphasizing at the beginning that one of the funds, i.e. Ramius Value & Opportunity Fund Ltd., does not reveal the amount of assets under its management, so it can not be taken into consideration in this analysis. The biggest  assets  out of  the  19 hedge  funds  left  have:  Sunnymeath  Partners, LLC  (800  thousand  dollars),  Cambrian  Fund  Ltd.(377  thousand  dollars)  and Gramercy  Global  Optimization  Fund  Ltd.(231  thousand  dollars).  The  three funds  with  the  smallest  assets  are:  Lazard  European  Discovery  L.P.(with  its assets  of  2,49  thousand  dollars),  McD  U.S.  Equity  Fund  Ltd.(having  assets equal to 3 thousand dollars), Okumus Long Only Fund (managing assets of 4,5 thousand  dollars).  Such  diversified amount  of  assets  proves  additionally  that funds were chosen at random.Chart 1. Assets under management of the examined funds [thousands of dollars] 3 See further: W.F.

The  investment  strategies  applied  by  the  examined  hedge  funds  are varied.  Although  every  fund  has  its  own  investment  policy,  they  have something  in  common.  These  are  investments  in  equity  with  long  positions only.  This  is  why  they  were  classified  as  equity  long  only  funds  by  data providers. Details  concerning  investment rules  of  each of  the  examined  funds are gathered in table 1.Table 1. The spectrum of investments of the examined hedge funds.

The focus  is  on  quality,  mid-cap, medium-to-low  tech  industrial products and  services  companies  which  are  temporarily  out-of-favor  and candidates  for  earnings  turnaround,  restructuring  and/or  takeover. Research approach: bottom-up, value,  fundamental  and  hands-on.  The Fund uses constructive shareholder activism, where appropriate. Due to a  high  degree  of  concentration,  correlation  with  the  non-U.S.  equity market  is  relatively  low.  Monthly  volatility  may  be  above  equity market volatility. Selective  use of leverage. No  use of futures, options or short sales.  Typical  equity  market  exposure range of 60%-140%  of net assets.  AUM (assets under management) reflects  total assets of the strategy.Sofire Fund LtdBy extensive fundamental  bottom-up  research,  we  identify  companies with quality businesses selling at a significant discount to their intrinsic value. These  securities often are  identified in the following categories: 1) Small market capitalization, 2) Hidden earnings, 3) Hidden assets, 4) Long  busines  cycles,  5)  Complicated  capital  structure, and  6)  Special situations.  The  Fund  invests  globally.  Security  selection  is  value-driven. The Fund, which has the ability to short, is typically a long-only fund.McD  U.S.  Equity Fund Ltd.The Fund's investment objective is to achieve long-term capital growth by  investing in  equity securities  of  companies  which  the  Investment Advisor  believes  are  sound  but  undervalued.  Securities  of a  company may be undervalued for a variety of reasons including: over-reaction by investors to unfavourable news about a company, industry, or the stock market  in  general, or  as  a  result of  a  market decline,  poor  economic conditions,  tax-loss  selling,  or  actual  or  anticipated  unfavourable developments affecting the company. The Fund will invest primarily in common stock of larger, listed companies with a record of earnings and dividends, low price-earnings  ratios,  reasonable returns on equity,  and sound finances which,  in the opinion of the Investment  Advisor,  have intrinsic value. It is anticipated that most stocks purchased will be listed on  the New  York Stock  Exchange,  but  the  Fund  may  also  purchase securities  listed  on  other  securities  exchanges  and  in  the  over-the-counter  market.  The  Fund  may  also  buy  and  sell  securities  index futures and options thereon.Hanseatic  Large CapHanseatic's  investment  process  is  the  combination  of  proprietary buy/sell  disciplines,  bottom-up  portfolio  construction  and  risk management methodology. The objective of  the investment  process  is to  create  positive  risk-adjusted  alpha  in  a  consistent  way.  The  buy disciplines  entail  a  proprietary  trend  measurement  which  takes  into account three operative time  dimensions - monthly, weekly and daily. The  purpose  of  the  buy  disciplines  is  to  identify  stock  price  trends which in  aggregate have the potential to persist into  our target holding period  (6-36  months).  Our  research  has  shown  that  there  are  time boundaries  in  the  relevant  time  dimensions  which  also  play  an important  role.  It  is  the  intersection  of  multi-time  dimensional  trend 485


Interdisciplinary Management Research V measurement  and  time  boundaries  that  is  the  foundation  of  our buy disciplines. The sell  disciplines  are designed to identify  points  in time when  the  risk-reward  relationship  over  an  intermediate  time  frame becomes  unfavorable.  Changes  in  the  risk-reward  relationship  may follow  a  period  of  objectively-measured underperformance  relative to the benchmark or coincide with various gauges of excess volatility. The purpose of the sell disciplines is to control individual security risk in  a consistent  manner  while  allowing  individual  stocks  with  positive intermediate-term alpha to remain in the portfolio. Each stock is subject to defined, albeit dynamic, risk management. Portfolio construction is a bottom-up  process  which  manages  overall  portfolio  risk  by  way  of position-sizing  and  diversification.  The  buy  disciplines  over  and underweight  market  sectors  and  industries  by  adapting  to  relative market  leadership  in  a  dynamic  way.  However  the  weightings  have guidelines  defined  for  sectors  and  industries,  +/-  10%  and  +/-  5% respectively. Initial position sizing ranges from 0.5-1% of the portfolio. Intelligent  diversification  is  a  cornerstone of  our  investment  process. The cumulative investment process enables portfolios that are adaptive to  changing  market  environments  and  achieve  positive  alpha  in  a consistent manner. Through  ongoing  research  the  company  endeavors to  improve  its alpha-generation  capabilities  and its  ability  to  manage the  portfolio  risk-reward  relationship.  The  company has  evolved with the  experience  and development  of its  investment  professionals. This will  remain  a  key  goal.  Mgmt.

Current  income  is  a  secondary objective.  In  particular,  the  Partnership's  investment  focus  is  on common  stocks  and  high  yield,  lower-rated  bonds  with  various maturities. There  can be  no assurance that the Partnership will achieve its investment objective.Orbis  Global EquityThe  Fund  invests  in  equities  globally  on  a  long-only  basis  using  a value-oriented approach.Permal  Pan European  Fund USD Class AInvests  primarily  in  equity  securities  of  large  and  small  companies domiciled  or  with  primary  operations  in  Europe.

Class AThe objective of the Fund is to  invest in  the equities of publicly traded European  stocks  that  comply  with  Islamic  investment  criteria.  The Investment  Manager,  TT  International  Investment  Management, pursues an investment strategy which combines detailed stock selection with  an  awareness  of  geopolitical  conditions.  To  implement  its strategy,  the  Investment  Manager  uses  a  three  part  stock  selection process  to:  1)  Identify  companies  that  display  value  in  the  form  of assets  or  earnings.  2)  Verify  valuations  through  the  use  of  various models and information obtained from academic  or industrial  experts. 3) Look for a catalyst to unlock the value that it has identified.  Bliss Fund (The)Bliss Fund employs a proprietary quantitative trading system that seeks to identify and exploit trends in the price movements of securities. The system  attempts  to  obtain  extraordinary  returns  by switching  between securities and cash (or cash equivalents) on the basis of the buy or sell signals generated.  Gramercy  Global Optimization  Fund Ltd.The Fund  is a long-only  equity fund that invests  in underlying closed-end equity funds. It can use leverage (but hasn't), and does not go short. It  has  a  management  fee  and  a  performance  fee  charged  on  excess performance  above  a  global  equity  index.  The  Fund  uses  a  mean-variance optimization process to select a global  portfolio of closed-end funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).Lazard  European Discovery L.P.The  investment  strategy  of  Lazard European  Discovery  is to  seek  to achieve long-term capital  appreciation by investing in up to  40  equity securities focusing primarily on companies located in Europe that have a  market capitalization  of approximately  EUR  1  billion  or  less.  The Fund utilizes an active bottom-up approach to stock selection and seeks to  invest  in  under-valued  companies  with  improving  or  sustainable financial  productivity  and  superior  business  attributes  such  as  high barriers  to  entry,  superior  products  or  services,  and/or  excellent management.  Companies  are  evaluated  according  to  the  appropriate measures  for  financial  productivity  and valuation  for  their respective industries.  The  Portfolio  Management  Team  focuses  on  metrics  that have successfully predicted performance in the past. The Team believes that understanding a  company's operating model and  the sustainability of its franchise is key to  understanding the  valuation  drivers.  Country or  regional  allocations  are  an outcome  of the  stock selection  process. The  investment  universe  consists  of  approximately  1,400  European companies with  a  market capitalization between  EUR 150 million  and 1 billion. The European  small cap  market can be relatively inefficient and  offers  attractive  investment  opportunities.  Through  detailed analysis,  the  Team  identifies  catalysts  and  opportunities  to  generate attractive  returns.  The  asset  class  advantages  are:  1)  Compelling opportunities  -  Numerous  companies  with  attractive  risk/reward tradeoffs remain under-invested as a result of low liquidity. 2) Limited coverage  -  Limited  sell-side  coverage  provides  the  opportunity  to 487


Interdisciplinary Management Research V invest in  undiscovered  companies.  3)  Attractive  ownership  structure  - Many  family-owned/limited  free-float  companies  are  increasingly willing to  access the capital  markets. 4) Growth  potential - Significant upside and potential for valuation re-rating.Hillsdale  US PerformanceEquity AThe investment  objective of the strategy is  to provide a three year  rate of return  on capital in  excess of the  Russell 2000 Index with volatility equal to or less than the Index. The Fund invests a minimum of 75% of its  assets  in a  diversified  selection of  small  to  medium  capitalization United  States  corporations  trading on  major US  stock  exchanges.  No equity holding of a single corporation, either through direct holdings or indirectly though an investment in another investment fund, will exceed 5% of the Fund's assets.Scopia Long LLCThe Fund's  investment objective is  to achieve attractive  rates of return primarily by investing in the publicly traded equities of companies. The investment strategy  utilized  by  the  investment  member  is  a long  only value-oriented  approach  which  seeks  to  identify  and purchase  stocks that will appreciate over a  several year period, although returns will be affected  by  the  performance  of  the  overall  market.

The  Fund's  portfolio  will comprise  mainly  of  US  equities  with  to  mid  to  large  market capitalization  across  various  industries  bought  at  prices  that  are tremendously  discounted  to the  companies'  intrinsic value.  The  Fund will not place bets on the market direction. The  Fund will  not  deploy any leverage and will not use any derivatives.SunnymeathPartners, LLCThe  principal  objective  of  the  Fund is  to realize  consistently superior long-term  growth  of  capital  while  mitigating  risk.  Utilization  of bottom-up fundamental analysis with an emphasis on cash flow guides investment  discipline.  The  Fund  de-emphasizes  technology  and financial  service  sectors  and  over-emphasizes  materials,  industrials, consumer discretionary and health care sectors relative to benchmark. The General  Partner believes that significant alpha can be  achieved by capitalizing  on  market  opportunities  in  companies  large  and  small, which it  believes are significantly  undervalued relative to  their growth potential. By  concentrating on a  relatively small number of companies at  any  one  time,  the  General  Partner  believes  he  can  trade opportunistically  around  these  value-oriented  investments  with thorough  and  reliable  information  about  each  company  through intensive  research,  contacts  with  company  management  and  industry seminars. The  General Partner has over  25 years experience  analyzing and  managing  assets  and  has  been  following  a  core  group  of  200 companies as possible purchase or short candidates for over 20 years.Ramius  Value  & Opportunity  Fund LtdRamius  Value  &  Opportunity  Fund  Ltd  invests  primarily  in  the securities of  U.S.  public  companies  that  the  Fund  believes are  deeply undervalued by  the marketplace.

Realization  of  value  may  occur  through  a change  in  ownership,  corporate  direction  or  management,  or  from operational  improvements.  The  Fund may  make investments  alone or together  with  one  or  more  other  investors  or  investment  managers, acting  as  a  group  in  order  to  maximize  resources  and  influence  the desired  outcome.  The  Fund  (either  alone  or  together  with  other members of  the group)  may take significant minority stakes  or acquire a  "control" position  in the  portfolio companies'  securities. The  Fund will  target  net  annualized  returns  over  a  complete  market  cycle  of approximately 20%.BluMont  Hirsch Performance FundThe BluMont Hirsch Performance Fund's  objective is to achieve above average  long-term  capital  growth  by investing  primarily  in Canadian corporations  with  superior  fundamentals  and  growth  profiles, encompassing companies with a range of capitalizations.Rutledge  Partners, L.P.Rutledge Partners is a long-biased U.S. equities program. Our  trading discipline is basic and straight  forward. We look for the best execution on  our  holdings.  Initial  positions  are  small,  as  fundamental  and technical  aspects  of the  stock improve,  we  will buy  up. We  look  for continuous validation that the company is on target fundamentally. We do not  have a  hedging strategy other than increasing  or decreasing our cash  position.  Our  approach is  to own  a collection of  businesses  that are best in class  or  are  on  the  cutting edge of their respective  product life.

Rates  of  return  and  risk  generated  by  hedge  funds  in  the  examined periodIn 2007 three funds  only  generated  minus  rates of return. It was Permal Japan Fund USD with its rate of return equal to -29,71%, Okumus Long Only Fund with the  rate  of  return  – 14,68% and  Lazard  European  Discovery L.P. having the rate of  return – 4,86% (see table  2). The rest of funds  had positive interest rates. The best result was achieved by Bliss Fund (28,10%), the second best by Alfanar  Europe  Ltd.  Class  A  (25,37%),  whereas  the  third  best  by  Cambrian Fund  Ltd.  (25,36%).  In  2008  the  situation  was  dramatically  worse.  All examined hedge funds generated minus rates of return. The worst was Permal Japan  Fund  USD  (-64,72%),  the  second  one  was  Cambrian  Fund  Ltd.  (-56,91%)  and  the  third  one  was  Gramercy  Global  Optimization  Fund  Ltd.  (-51,48%).  Thus  the  results  for  2008  show  that  hedge  funds  were  not  able  to generate positive rates of return during the bear market, as it is usually assumed theoretically.As  far  as  alpha  coefficients  are  concerned,  in  2007,  6  funds  had  the  alpha coefficient below zero. The rest of them achieved positive alphas among which 489


Interdisciplinary Management Research V the highest one was generated by Bliss Fund (1,82), the second best by Alfanar Europe Ltd. Class A (1,53) and the third best by Cambrian Fund Ltd. (1,50). In 2008  more  than  a  half  (exactly  11)  of  the  examined  funds  achieved  alphas below  zero,  which  was  a  worse  result  than the previous  year.  The  best  result had Okumus Long Only Fund (1,89), the second best was Sunnymeath Partners, LLC  (1,87)  and  the  third  best  was  Scopia  Long  LLC  (1,11).  It  is  worth emphasizing however that the average alpha of the three best funds in 2007 and 2008  is  the  same  and  equal  to  about  1,62.  However  if  one  takes  into consideration all examined hedge funds, the average alpha generated in 2008 is much lower than the one generated in 2007, which is a result of the fact that the majority of hedge funds did not manage to beat up the market.The analysis of risk measured by beta shows that 14 funds increased their betas. Only 6 hedge funds managed to decrease them. If one takes into consideration poor rates of income, it is another proof that hedge funds did not perform well.Table 2.

There was just one fund that decreased its risk (-22,95%)  in  the  mentioned  period.  It  was  Rutledge  Partners,  L.P.  Other  19 hedge funds raised their risk by 31,23% (in the case of Bliss Fund) to 221,48% (in the case of Sofire Fund Ltd.). The highest rises were generated by the earlier mentioned Sofire Fund Ltd.

In  2007  six  funds’  Sharpe  ratios  were  negative,  whereas  in  2008  all hedge  funds  had  negative  Sharpe ratios  (see  table  4). If  one  looks  at  Sharpe ratios from  the  2008  perspective in  comparison  to  2007, 19  funds  have  lower Sharpe  ratios  in 2008  than  the previous  year. It  was just  Okumus Long  Only 491


Interdisciplinary Management Research V Fund  whose  Sharpe  ratio  increased,  however  it was below  zero  both in 2007 and in 2008.  As  for  the  correlation  ratio,  it  increased  for  the  majority  of  funds (exactly for 16) in 2008 compared with 2007. Four funds only diminished their correlation  ratios  value.  These  were  Hanseatic  Large  Cap  (from0,90  to  0,89), Permal Pan European Fund USD Class A (from 0,86 to 0,59),  Ramius Value & Opportunity  Fund  Ltd  (from  0,62  to  0,58) and  Rutledge Partners,  L.P  (from 0,30  to  0,28).  It  is  also  worth  emphasizing  that  correlation  ratios  for  the  vast majority of the  examined  funds are high or moderate. Only  two  funds in 2007 have  week  correlation  ratio  (Permal Japan  Fund  USD  and  Rutledge Partners, L.P.) and just one hedge fund has a weak correlation with the S&P500 index in 2008 (Rutledge Partners, L.P.).Table 4.

Interdisciplinary Management Research V Final findings As it was shown in the paper equity long only hedge funds did not perform well during the bear market. It means that theoretical assumptions on the activity of hedge funds were not fulfilled in the examined period. The similar results were achieved for emerging markets funds, as well as for equity long bias funds so far.  The  rest  of  the  strategies  will  be  examined  in  the  nearest  future  by  the author, which will let draw conclusions on the industry as a whole.In December 2006, the ECB voiced „unease” at the distribution of credit risk to „opaque”  players  such  as  hedge  funds  in  its  twice-yearly  Financial  Stability Forum. The UK’s Financial Services Authority has also  raised  concerns  about over-reliance  on  historical  data,  call  in  for  a  reassessment  of  some  players’ pricing assumptions for risk and greater stress testing. (Gore; 2007, 13.) Thus,  if  one  additionally  takes  into  consideration  recent  discussions  on  the influence of hedge funds on the global financial stability5, it raises the question what hedge funds really are.

Determination of Investment Companies Efficiency and Effect Of Macroeconomic Factors on Their Portfolio Return[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: This is an empirical research that tried to determine the efficiency of portfolio management on investment companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange that had active portfolio management from 2005 to 2009 by Sharpe, Treynor, Jensen, M2 and Information ratios. For more profound study, the effect of macroeconomic factors on their portfolio return, monthly issued by the central bank, is evaluated. The result of statistical analyzing indicated that the performance of some investment companies is more efficient than market. Therefore, it can be deduced that in the situation of market crisis, investing on such companies are more rational than making individual portfolio. With regard to economic actors, Step Forward Anova showed that the fluctuation of currency rate is the most influential factor on the return of investment companies’ portfolio.

Investment Approach

											AIP Long/Short Fund P (the "Fund"), through its investment in its master fund, AIP Long Short Fund A ("LSF A") invests substantially all its assets in private investment funds (commonly referred to as hedge funds) that are managed by a select group of alternative investment managers that employ different long and short equity investment strategies. Long and short equity strategies, like other types of alternative investment strategies, allow investment managers the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to seek to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets.

							Past performance is not indicative of future results.
							
							
								
									
								
								
								
								
								
								
									Growth of investment performance is since the Fund's inception date, based on the net of fees return experience of the Fund. Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees;  2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of the underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 0.75% per annum management fee; 5) the 0.75% per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses. Performance links monthly performance through compound multiplication. Results are hypothetical.

Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the AIP Long/Short Fund A and the AIP Long/Short Fund P, as applicable, carefully before investing. The prospectus for each Long/Short Fund contains this and other information about the relevant Long/Short Fund and can be obtained by contacting your financial advisor. Please read the prospectus of the relevant Long/Short Fund carefully before investing.
AIP Long/Short Fund A and AIP Long/Short Fund P are Delaware statutory trust that issue shares.
Morgan Stanley does not provide tax advice. The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature. It was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. Your clients should always consult their own legal or tax advisor for information concerning their individual situations.
Morgan Stanley Distribution, Inc. is a principal underwriter of the Funds. Morgan Stanley is a full-service securities firm engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, investment banking, research and analysis, financing and financial advisory services.
Past performance is not indicative of future returns.
Risk Considerations
Alternative investments, like the AIP Long/Short Fund A and the AIP Long/Short Fund P are speculative and include a high degree of risk. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. The Long/Short Fund is suitable only for long-term investors willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. The Long/Short Fund is highly illiquid - there is no secondary market for the shares of the Long/Short Fund, and there are restrictions on redemptions and assigning or otherwise transferring interests in the Long/Short Fund. The Long/Short Funds shares are not readily marketable and liquidity is provided only through expected quarterly repurchase offers. The Long/Short Fund has higher fees and expenses than other investment vehicles, and such fees and expenses will lower the returns achieved by investors. Funds of funds often have a higher fee structure than single manager funds as a result of the additional layer of fees. The underlying funds in which the Long/Short Fund invest (the "Underlying Funds") often engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase volatility and risk of loss. The Underlying Funds are often unregulated, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, and are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors.
See Risk Factors and Other Considerations for important disclosures. Investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with limited liquidity and therefore should be viewed as a long-term investment. For a complete description of terms and conditions, fees and other expenses, see the Fund's prospectus.
The Fund is offering shares solely pursuant to its prospectus, and any information regarding the Fund or shares in the Fund that is not contained in the relevant prospectus shall not constitute an offering of shares in the Fund. Consequently, this material has been prepared solely for informational purposes and is not an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell shares of the Funds or any other security or instrument or to participate in any trading strategy. No person or entity has been authorized in connection with this offering to give any information or make any representations other than as contained in the prospectus or in this marketing material. This does not constitute an offer to, or solicitation of, such person or entity.
Fund net return is unaudited and subject to change and represents the total return for the month based on information received from underlying managers. The return is equal to the change in value of the Fund, including capital appreciation and income, as a percentage of the beginning value. The amount earned is the difference between the beginning and ending values, adjusted for the net of all contributions and withdrawals (cash flow). The rate of return is calculated on a time-weighted basis for all investments and is net of 1) underlying manager fees; 2) broker commissions and expenses related to trading and the administration of LSF A's underlying managers' funds and the Fund; 3) the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains; 4) the 0.75% per annum management fee; 5) the 0.75% per annum shareholder servicing fee; and 6) operating expenses. Return does not include the impact of any sales charge, which would reduce returns.
a In parallel with LSF A, subject to authorization by Board of Trustees, generally in an amount up to 15% of NAV of LSF A.
b The "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" include the operating expenses (1.38%), trading expenses (2.56%) and performance-based incentive fees of the Investment Funds in which the Master Fund has invested (0.43%)  for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The operating expenses consist of management fees, administration fees, professional fees (i.e., audit and legal fees), and other operating expenses. Trading expenses are primarily interest and dividend expenses and are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the Investment Funds’ managers in order to enhance investor returns. The information used to determine the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is generally based on the most recent shareholder reports received from the respective Investment Funds or, when not available, from the most recent communication from the Investment Funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the Investment Funds’ managers/general partners in the form of management fees generally ranging from 1.0% to 3.0% annually of net assets and performance incentive fees are generally 10% to 30% of net profits earned. Some Investment Funds employ a passthrough expense arrangement with no stated management fee. Fees and expenses of Investment Funds are based on historical fees and expenses. Future Investment Funds’ fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower because certain fees are based on the performance of the Investment Funds, which may fluctuate over time.
c The total annual Fund expenses include the Fund’s portion of the management fees, performance allocations and other expenses paid by the Investment Funds that are described as "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.”

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.

  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating
