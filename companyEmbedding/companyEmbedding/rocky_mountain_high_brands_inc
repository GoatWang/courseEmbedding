Rocky Mountain High Brands Files 8-K on Preferred A Voting Rights Rollback
Jul 17, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
DALLAS, July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. (OTCQB:RMHB), a fully reporting consumer goods company specializing in hemp-infused food and beverage products and a naturally high alkaline water, announced today that the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 14, 2017. 
The Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Certificate of Designation for its Series A Preferred Stock on July 14, 2017. The amendment changes the voting rights only of the Series A Preferred Stock from 1,200 votes for every share of Series A Preferred Stock to 400 votes for every share of Series A Preferred Stock.  The voting rights were previously amended and increased on March 13, 2017 from 400 votes for every share to 1,200 votes for every share of Series A Preferred Stock.  The action, taken by RMHB’s Board on July 14, 2017, provides holders of its Common Stock a stronger voice in the Company. On July 5, 2017, RMHB’s Board of Directors approved a separate amendment to the Certificate of Designation for its Series A Preferred Stock. The amendment changed the conversion ratio of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock from 1,200 shares of Common Stock for every share of Series A Preferred Stock to 100 shares of Common Stock for every share of Series A Preferred Stock. The conversion ratio was previously amended and increased on March 13, 2017 from 100 shares of Common Stock for every share of Series A Preferred Stock to 1,200 shares of Common Stock for every share of Series A Preferred Stock. This action, taken by RMHB’s Board on July 5, 2017, decreased the potential dilution of the Company’s Common Stock for our shareholder base. The combined effect of these two separate actions by RMHB’s Board of Directors returned the voting rights and conversion ratio of the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock to its position prior to the filing of the March 13, 2017 amendment. About Rocky Mountain High Brands: ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH BRANDS, INC., is a consumer goods company specializing in brand development of health conscious, hemp-infused food and beverage products. The Company currently markets a lineup of four naturally flavored hemp-infused beverages (Citrus Energy, Black Tea, Mango Energy and Lemonade) and a low calorie Coconut Lime Energy drink.

Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. (RMHB) Trademark Granted for New CBD Line-Up of Products
Nov 10, 2015
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
DALLAS, Nov.  10, 2015  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. (OTCPK:RMHB) announced today that they have received a Notice of Allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on their new Blue Leaf design. Upon completion of the process showing that the mark is in service, a trademark will be issued.
When the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to issue a trademark, it sends the applicant a Notice of Allowance. For this to happen, an applicant provides information such as product description, design, and blueprints or drawings. A patent examiner then processes the patent application, and ultimately decides whether a patent should be issued. For the patent to be issued, the applicant must complete two additional steps after receiving the notice -- pay the required issue fee and submit any final drawings. In the United States, a Trademark is a form of legal protection granted to the assignee. Currently, Rocky Mountain High Brands is marketing and selling a line-up of beverages in the marketplace that contain 100 mg of hempseed extract in each 12 oz. can. Seeds of the plant cannabis sativa – also known as hemp seed, contain all the essential amino acids and essential fatty acids necessary to maintain healthy human life. No other single plant source has the essential acids in such an easily digestible form, nor has the essential fatty acids in as perfect a ratio to meet the nutritional needs of human beings. Thus, hemp seed and hemp seed oil may be considered to be the most nutritionally complete food source in the world. In the very near future, Rocky Mountain High Brands will launch a line-up of their Blue Leaf beverages that will include 25mg of cannabidiol (CBD) per container. To learn more about the numerous consumer benefits of CBD, please click on the following link: http://healthbenefitscannabidiol.com/ See the new Rocky Mountain High Hemp Beverage can: http://rockymountainhighbrands.com/products/ One of the most famous shapes in the world is the iconic contour fluted lines of the Coca-Cola bottle. In 1906, The Coca-Cola Company introduced a diamond shaped label with a colorful trademark to stand out from the infringers. On November 16th, 1915 incorporated into the lettering on the final design of the bottle. It is interesting to note that the patent submission was made without the signature embossed Coca-Cola script lettering. This was done to protect the secrecy of the design and the ultimate client. "Consumers purchasing decisions are influenced by trademarks and designs and the reputation that such brands represent. We believe the new Rocky Mountain High’s Blue Leaf conveys a positive, intellectual and emotional message in people's minds. Trademarks and design patents provide value beyond our core business and will help pave the way for expansion of a worldwide market and increase the valuation of the Company," said Jerry Grisaffi, Founder of Rocky Mountain High Brands.

ABOUT
Rocky Mountain High Brands (RMHB) is a publicly-traded brand management company which specializes in developing, manufacturing, marketing, and distributing high-quality, health conscious, hemp-infused food and beverage products.
 OUR STORYIn July of 2014, a world-class product development team took a revolutionary idea – a healthful, hemp-infused energy drink – from concept to first production run in just 7 short months. Since then, we’ve produced 3,700,000 cans, and are on an aggressive growth trajectory.
Due to the success of our hemp-infused citrus energy drink, the line was expanded to include 4 other great-tasting, hemp-infused beverages – mango energy, low calorie coconut lime energy, lemonade, and black tea.
We have also recently evolved our can design to appeal to a broader audience, as our initial brand identity was deemed to be too alternative in some circles. The benefits of hemp are too great to limit our audience to only the most passionate hemp supporters, and we are committed to educating and engaging each and every customer.
We have also broadened the line to include 2 new hemp-infused energy shots (mango energy and mixed berry energy) and a new hemp-infused relaxation brownie.WHY ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH? WHY NOW?
There is a significant opportunity RIGHT NOW for an alternative, high quality, healthful energy drink to gain major market share against competitors like Red Bull, Monster, and 5 Hour Energy.
The energy drink market (estimated at $56 billion globally) is being driven by innovation, and consumers are looking for healthier, safer products that deliver comparable energy results. Functional beverages continue to be the hottest segment in beverages, driven primarily by energy drinks in the US, while carbonated soft drinks are at a 30-year low in sales.
Rocky Mountain High is a line of natural, healthful beverages, infused with hemp, ginseng, and guarana, that is positioned exceptionally well for continued growth and sustained success.
 
OUR VISION

Our vision is to push the boundaries of what a healthful, functional product should be in order to raise the quality of life for all humanity.
 
OUR MISSION

Our mission is to recognize how emerging food and beverage ingredients, such as hemp and naturally high alkaline spring water, can be leveraged to create great tasting, functional products that are healthful, safe, and in-demand, and to expand our product portfolio in response to that demand.
WHY HEMP?Hemp seeds are rich in healthy fats, protein, and minerals. This creates an opportunity to market our products to health conscious consumers. Some of the primary health benefits of hemp seeds include:    Our hemp-infused products are THC-Free

Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. (RMHB) Adds Eagle Spirit Spring Water to Its Product Line

Marijuana Stocks News May 25, 2017 0 749 














Rocky Mountain High Brands Announces Indian Nation Wholesale Adds Eagle Spirit Spring Water to Its Product Line – Distribution Agreement Signed for Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Kansas and Arkansas








 Rocky Mountain High Brands, Inc. (RMHB), a fully reporting consumer goods company specializing in hemp-infused food and beverage products and a naturally high alkaline water, announced today that a distribution agreement with Stephenson Wholesale Co., Inc., dba Indian Nation Wholesale, was recently signed.  As a result, Eagle Spirit Spring Water will be added to their product line as a premium water.




















Michael Welch, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rocky Mountain High Brands, stated, “Indian Nation Wholesale chose Eagle Spirit Spring Water as a premium water after an extensive evaluation process.  They loved the story of our water and its Native American heritage.  Our Made/Produced by American Indians certification mark also was another contributing factor in their decision. It provided our Rocky Mountain High Water Company subsidiary the needed authenticity of being a Native American Majority Owned Enterprise. The taste of our water, its story, its Native American Heritage and the Made/Produced by American Indians certification mark will all be huge selling tools for Indian Nation Wholesale’s staff when they call on their customers, which include casinos located in Southern Oklahoma.”
Welch continued, “Indian Nation Wholesale is a highly respected and experienced distributor and has a very strong footprint in market growth areas that are closer to our corporate headquarters in Dallas. This marketing strategy perfectly aligns itself with the recommendations from our new Board members, Gerry David and Kevin Harrington. Our agreement with Indian Nation Wholesale is the first of many steps toward achieving that commitment to Mr. David and Mr. Harrington in growing the market in our own back yard.”
About Indian Nation Wholesale:

INW offers top industry products in a large variety of categories such as candy, beverage, snacks, HBA, foodservice, paper goods and much more.
Their warehouse utilizes state of the art technology including innovations from Vocollect, Tax Right and Red Stamp to increase our error-free delivery rate in excess of 99.6%. INW’s well-maintained fleet and courteous drivers stand ready to provide their customers with accurate, on-time next-day delivery, with no order minimums or tote charges.

Additionally, they support their retailers with opportunities through marketing programs, such as the GATEWAY CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAM.
