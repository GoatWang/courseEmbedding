      his charge since joining Tornier in July 2011 as Chief Operating

      We believe the increased focus on execution of our US sales channel

      product pipeline will return Tornier to double-digit, constant currency 
      revenue growth on a pro forma basis. I am grateful to the Board of 
      Directors for the opportunity to lead Tornier, and I am excited to work 
      with the talented and dedicated Tornier team.”

Mr. Mowry intends on limiting his board participation to Alphatec (outside of Vyaire) in order to fully engage with Alphatec and remain focused on helping the Company pursue its goals. "Dave brings a wealth of proven business and leadership experience within the orthopedic and spine industries," said Terry Rich, Chief Executive Officer of Alphatec Spine. "Dave has been a key mentor in my career and I am excited to work with him again.  His decision to join the board demonstrates confidence in our vision and ability to build a high-growth U.S. spine company through innovation and value creation.  We look forward to his counsel and benefitting from his impressive background and expertise." Dave H. Mowry commented, "Alphatec is at a pivotal point in its evolution with a strong portfolio of spinal fusion products, its focus on the U.S. market and its new, spine-experienced leadership team.  I have had the pleasure of working with Terry and several of his new commercial leaders in the past.  We share a common approach for delivering results and I am excited about being engaged with him and his team.  I look forward to contributing to the achievement of their strategic goals and supporting Alphatec's future growth."
