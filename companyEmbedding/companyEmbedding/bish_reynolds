History[edit]
The company was founded in 1985[2] and was acquired by Dicom Group in 1999. It floated in the Alternative Investment Market in 1996 and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1997.[3] In January 2008 the parent company changed its name from Dicom Group to Kofax.[4] In May 2011 Kofax acquired Atalasoft Inc., a small software firm whose primary product was a document imaging toolkit named dotImage. In December 2011 Kofax acquired Singularity Limited, a provider of business process management (BPM) and case management software. In July 2013 Kofax acquired Kapow Software, a data integration software provider. Kofax was first listed on the NASDAQ in December 2013.

The First Mile[edit]
The “First Mile” is a trademark of Kofax;[6][not in citation given] it is intended to describe the initial information-intensive interactions customers have with an organization, such as loan applications, claims submissions, and new account openings. The company claims[citation needed] to make these initial interactions better for customers by providing software and technology applications – document capture, process management, dynamic case management, mobile applications and analytics software – to connect an organization's system of record (e.g., ERP, CRM and LOB systems) with its systems of engagement (e.g., email, fax, web portals, mobile devices).[7]

I'm happy with him ensuring that the business is well-run so we have long-term job security.- No bonusesAdvice to Management- Stay the course through the current acquisition, and then deliver on long-term stability- Be more open to modern concepts like telecommuting- Embrace some new-fangled employee benefits, increase 401k contributions, etc. to sweeten the deal for employeesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-05-10 15:00 PDT Jul 14, 2017 Helpful (1)"Good People ...

The vast majority of the personnel are talented, professional, dedicated people.ConsExecutive management have done a very poor job of realizing the benefits of their more recent acquisitions, and have failed to achieve the market penetration they anticipated. The EMT seems to have failed to maintain focus on their vision for these products, in favor of focusing on selling the company (which they've done 3 times in two years now), with the unfortunate result of significant reductions in core revenue around their supposed flagship products. The EMT's response to poor performance has been typical for the Bisch regime, which is to reduce cost (read 'lay off personnel"). Even this though has been done thoughtlessly and in ways that will almost certainly set efforts back by at least two years. Morale is as low as it has ever been in the last 8+ years.Advice to ManagementCommit to the vision and understand that it will take more than reorganization to achieve your objectives. Do more than lip service to realize the value of your personnel.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-07-14 06:21 PDT Join the Kofax team See Our Latest Jobs Jul 11, 2017 Helpful (1)"Bad management"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Experience Developer in Lenexa, KSFormer Employee - Experience Developer in Lenexa, KSDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Kofax (More than a year)ProsThe software and current employees are what drive this company. Being the backbone that they are, they are fairly good. The benefits are on the upper end of what *some* might have experienced so far. Work-Life balance is stressed, and is better than some companies, but with the current vacation planning and such, it doesn't come through 100%.ConsFully on the management. They treat the employees as if they are just numbers. They don't understand what some of the software teams *need* in order to get the software done, and on time. Bisch just looks to profit off of selling the company and keeping it in that selling state.Advice to ManagementGet to know the employees, even the ones that are the lowest on the totem-pole. Try to understand what the teams need, and not just look at raw numbers. Any monkey can look at numbers and come up with something to do about them. Understanding where they come from, why they are there, why they are necessary, will help alleviate the frustration the employees have with you. Right now, there is no incentive to stay long at all software wise. It's either going to be a stepping stone for the developers to move on to greater things, or the developers like to *be* the stepping stone and don't care how poorly you treat their teams and structure.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-07-11 13:37 PDT Jun 5, 2017"Nice people but old tech"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CAFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Kofax full-time (More than a year)ProsThe people are really nice, for the most part.

It appears to be just an average company that focuses on the bottom line and not employee moral or motivation.ConsThe CEO is very conceited. To quote him when asked if he was worried about a new Private Equity firm removing the ELT... "We are the most valuable aspect of the company". Previously with Perceptive, the employees were considered one of the most valuable aspects of the company. There will be a lot of negativity, primarily because we went from a great and fun place to work... to just some average company. There is a high rate of turnover. Some of the Sectors are going to struggle, specifically with Healthcare. The HC sales teams have been depleted and Growth will probably come to a halt and take several years to recover.Advice to ManagementFocus on retaining the talent we have. Focus on attracting Great talent. We take some great benefits such a "unlimited vacation". These are the types of things that will get you the BEST talent. These are the types of things that will get you growth. Its important to focus on the bottom line, but you have to realize that items such as "unlimited vacation" really don't cost you on the bottom line.Polish your message to employees. Don't invite them to leave. The only vision I've seen is layoffs and more work for the remaining staff. Don't tell the employees their new benefit packages have some improvements but can't seem to give any examples of those improvements. Understand that the negativity derives from a talented and productive group going from Great to just Average.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-04-12 17:33 PDT Feb 15, 2017 Helpful (7)"Don't believe everything you read here from a few disgruntled whiners resistant to change and stuck in the status quo"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CARecommendsNeutral OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Kofax full-time (More than 10 years)ProsI've been employed at Kofax for 11 years (and no I'm not a rose colored glasses recruiter with an agenda, but I do feel inclined to set the record straight a bit after seeing some one sided posts). If you want to see a tight and well run company then I'd say Kofax is an interesting case study and its given me a path for career growth and maturity along the way that will help me perform well and see through the useless, and wasteful practices some other company's employ elsewhere. What I like most about Kofax is the people I work with. There are some solid down to earth people that dwell in the trenches every day and find satisfaction in what they do and don't let other adolescent naysayers weigh them down (which exist probably at every company to some extent -wasn't high school like 20+ years go, people?).ConsManagement can sometimes be misunderstood primarily by employees less familiar and newer to Kofax business practices that have become comfortable in less ambitious companies they worked for in the past and don't want to change, or are used to doing things that don't make sound business sense. Those that are at the nerve center of the company get it though, and others sometimes don't understand that management is ambitious and aggressive but generally has a good reason for doing what they are doing (though sometimes not good at helping others understand their reasons is probably primary fault could improve on). The company is not perfect and mistakes have been made along the way, but I'm encouraged by recent course correction and direction that management is taking to retain talent. If you like to hide in an overly bloated department of people that creates busywork fluff to do everyday rather than adding real business value than Kofax is probably not the place for you (you'll get discovered eventually, though sometimes it takes longer than it should).Advice to ManagementGet out from under the current headwinds and put laser focus on on building what is a broad portfolio of products with lots of opportunity for continued growth. Dust off the vision and direction a bit, and built a trajectory from a strong foundation that has been built out of all those years of driving strong shareholder value as a publicly traded company that was under the microscope and naturally became an interesting acquisition target to Lexmark. Slow down a little bit to make sure employees understand they are valued and so everyone can jump on board to row together in the same direction to ensure mutual success.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-02-15 20:14 PST Apr 5, 2017 Helpful (5)"Kofax, the new normal"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Lenexa, KSCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Lenexa, KSDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Kofax full-time (More than a year)Pros* Coworkers* Lenexa Office* The software we utilize does in fact help out business processes, so seeing the software that we do have makes my day feel complete as I get the enjoyment of building out software and configuring it to the business need of the client* Most people in the Lenexa office are technical so it it nice to have that base, you never feel alone when it comes to a project as your "team" is there to help you through the solution.Cons* Healthcare benefits are sub par. Since re-branding to Kofax, from Lexmark Enterprise Software healthcare costs have gone up.* Merit increases are slim to none and with all of these additional costs rising, it's making the salary seem very very unacceptable.* The Kofax management team is not putting their employees first. We're on the sidelines basically awaiting the takeover to complete.* Unlimited PTO is no longer. The work/life balance as it was once known is obliterated.Advice to ManagementI suggest the C level execs start listening to their employees otherwise there will no longer be a Kofax, Inc, as it will be buried into the ground.Get fresh new faces in those C level positions that are looking out for their employees instead of striping away their benefitsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-04-05 07:18 PDT Feb 9, 2017 Helpful (4)"Great people, fast-paced, changing environment"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CACurrent Employee - Anonymous Employee in Irvine, CADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Kofax full-time (More than 3 years)Pros- Talented, intelligent, committed people- Great pay- Opportunity to make a differenceCons- Authoritarian executive management style, promotes CYA attitudes- M&A strategic approach for technical innovation, causes systemic disruption and upheaval- Do not promote from withinAdvice to Management- Prioritize business initiatives to avoid burnout- Adopt more collaborative work practices- Lead more, manage less- Promote from withinShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-02-09 21:19 PST Feb 12, 2017 Helpful (21)"Worst experience in my 25 year IT Sales Career"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales Manager in Denver, COFormer Employee - Sales Manager in Denver, CODoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Kofax full-time (More than a year)ProsPrevious fat client Generations of Kofax Capture and Extraction were market leaders, and are still available for sale. Those earlier versions, Kofax Analytics, and Kofax Robotic Process Automation, keep the lights on for Kofax today, even thought they are siloed and non-integrated offerings. Sales Salaries are generally a little higher here than at other mid sized software companies.ConsTHE COMPANY IS FOR SALE (AGAIN): Reynolds Bish (CEO) manipulates the company's direction to leverage himself into more and more stock while doing nothing to grow revenues. He personally maintains a significant shareholder position, and so that every time he sells the failing (but entrenched) company, he makes millions. $3.5B Lexmark foolishly over leveraged themselves to buy Kofax for $1B in 2015, and Bish saw his opportunity, by blocking all investment in SW innovation, and integration with Lexmark, to force his Parent to sell Lexmark to a Chinese Consortium (Apex/PAG) in late 2016. In the process, Riffed over 1000, while making himself millions in this latest sale. And It get's worse for the employees that remain... because CFIUS (The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US) has forced the Chinese to divest itself of the SW entity, so Kofax is for sale again setting Bish up for another big stock take. This is the stuff you read about, High Finance where the rich get richer by taking advantage of employees. My team lost all but the smallest "additional capacity" deals they were working on because of the Kofax' revolving ownership problems, and the uncertainty associated with the next sale of the company by the Chinese.THE FLAGSHIP PRODUCT (Total Agility) DOESNT WORK: When Kofax moved from a their earlier Fat Client Architecture, to Thin Client (as the market demands), the product stopped working at scale. One of the nations largest Insurance companies, at least 2 of the largest global financial companies, and the largest US gaming and resort company, are all suing Kofax for breach of contract due to product failure. While they advertise that they do, they have no SaaS solution. This because Bish gets to recognize SaaS revenues ratably over time, where Perpetual Licenses pay Bish "Up-Front" - if you do sell a SaaS deal, expect the company to take the business, but don't expect to be paid commissions.EXPECT TO HAVE (even perpetual) COMMISSIONS WITHELD and/or REFUSED. Bish regularly manipulates and changes territories and accounts to limit the commissions that he has to pay, especially when it comes to "big deals". If that territory manipulation doesn't work, he will simply refuse to pay commissions. My team and I sold the largest two deals in the company's history, and I had to beg to get paid on the first, and was paid less than half of the commissions owed on the second. If you're a true salesperson, you will be frustrated to no end here. If you're a B/C Player and you can live on your salary, this could be the place for you. You will have to endure lots of "beatings" and grilling around your sales cycles, while getting no value from the managers who do it, but if you can live on your salary you can work here forever - they can't fire you because they can't replace you. I tried for 2 years to build a full team, but saw almost no resumes from recruiting. Kofax also advertises Mobile functionality, but has 2 sales people/overlays for the entire US, and is simply selling Capture and Extraction in their SDK, which doesn't work well, and leaves integration to back end systems to their customers.Advice to ManagementUntil Bish is out of the picture, this company is going nowhere; everyone is simply lining Bish's pockets and setting him up for his next big sale of the company. Get a new CEO, and New Sr. Sales Managment. Develop a true SaaS offering, the technology is perfect for it and the market wants it. Learn to leverage your existing renewal base. Fix Total Agility (the thin client version of their leading Capture and Extraction technology).Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (21) Kofax Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Kofax 2017-02-12 07:10 PST Showing 166 of 168 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Kofax RSS Feed</>Embed Kofax Careers About Us Kofax (KFX) is a leading provider of software to simplify and tranform the First Mile of business.

Reynolds Kitchens™ Freezer Paper is ideal for wrapping foods for freezing and also for general household purposes. The thick paper gives the product strength and durability. One side of the paper is plastic-coated and provides a barrier to air and moisture. This protects the quality, flavor and nutrition of foods during freezing. The other side is a durable paper which can be written on. This means it’s easy to write on the contents and pack date before freezing foods.Outside of the freezer, this paper also keeps messy foods, markers and paint at bay.  For household crafts projects, Reynolds Kitchens™ Freezer Paper is perfect for banners, writeable tablecloths, stencils and more. It’s also great for protecting kitchen counters or lining shelves and drawers. For crafting and quilting, use it as templates for appliqués or kids painting, school banners and projects. The usages are endless.

Product Faqs


Q
 
Which side of Reynolds Kitchens Freezer Paper goes next to the food?


A
 
Place the food on the shiny or plastic coated side when wrapping. The plastic-coated side keeps food moisture from soaking through the paper. The dull or paper side should face out. It’s made to be easy to write on, so you can label the outside of the package. To keep air out and ensure freshness, secure the wrapped package with freezer tape, which will stick easily to the dull/paper side.




Q
 
Can I use freezer paper in the oven, like parchment paper?


A
 
Reynolds Kitchens Freezer Paper and Reynolds® Parchment Paper are very different products. Freezer paper should not be used in an oven because it has a plastic coating that will melt in the oven.




Q
 
How do you use freezer paper in quilting?


A
 
To use Reynolds Kitchens Freezer Paper in quilting, trace quilting design onto dull side of freezer paper, cut it out and iron shiny side onto the fabric. Cut out the fabric around the design, allowing for a 1/4" seam. Fold the fabric seam allowance under the freezer paper and stitch the appliqué onto the background fabric. Pull out the freezer paper through a small area left unstitched.
