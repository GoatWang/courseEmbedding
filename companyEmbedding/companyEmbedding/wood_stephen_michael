Steven Michael Woods, Jr. (April 17, 1980 – September 13, 2011)[1] was an American who was executed by lethal injection in the state of Texas.[2] Woods was sentenced to the death penalty after a jury convicted him of the capital murders of drug dealer Ronald Whitehead, 21, and Bethena Brosz, 19, on May 2, 2001 in The Colony, Texas.[3] Woods petitioned to media outlets for prisoner rights in February 2004.[4]
He was incarcerated on the Texas state death row for men, located in the Allan B. Polunsky Unit (formerly the Terrell Unit) in West Livingston, Texas. In late 2006, Woods was part of a hunger strike in Polunsky, to oppose death row inmates' treatment.[5]

Sentencing[edit]
Woods' co-defendant, Marcus Rhodes, pleaded guilty to shooting both victims to death with a firearm in the same criminal transaction and received a life sentence. During the trial it was revealed that authorities had recovered backpacks belonging to the slain pair along with shell casings and a bloodied knife in Rhodes' car. Guns used in the slayings were also recovered from the home of Rhodes' parents.[6]
However, in Texas, the Law of Parties states that a person can be criminally responsible for the actions of another if he or she aids and abets, conspires with the principal or anticipates the crime. Although Rhodes pleaded guilty to the murders and Woods' did not, and there was no physical evidence tying Woods to the scene, Woods was executed for the crime.[7] Witnesses testified at Woods' 2002 trial that he and Rhodes said that they lured Whitehead to an isolated road on the pretense of a drug deal and that Woods shot and killed him, because Whitehead knew about a killing two months earlier in California. Rhodes was later found guilty of the California murder and Woods was not. Prosecutors said Brosz was merely driving her boyfriend Whitehead to the drug deal. Brosz had been killed because she witnessed Whitehead's death, yelled and then attempted to flee.[2]
Controversy[edit]
The fairness of Woods' case and punishment was criticized by Noam Chomsky[8] and Amnesty International.[9] Woods' criminal case was reported locally and internationally.[10][11][12] Woods' final motion for a stay was denied on September 2, 2011.[13]
Execution[edit]
In his last words, Woods stated:


“
"You're not about to witness an execution, you are about to witness a murder. I am strapped down for something Marcus Rhodes did. I never killed anybody, never. I love you, Mom. I love you, Tali. This is wrong. This whole thing is wrong. I can't believe you are going to let Marcus Rhodes walk around free. Justice has let me down. Alex Calhoun completely screwed this up. (changed from 'Alex Calhoun' to 'Somebody' in the Last Statement listed on the TDCJ Web site. Alex Calhoun was Woods' attorney). I love you too, Mom. Well Warden, if you are going to murder someone, go ahead and do it. Pull the trigger. It's coming. I can feel it coming. Goodbye everyone, I love you".[14]
”


Woods then took several deep breaths before all body movement stopped.[2] A needle carrying the lethal drugs on his right arm pierced a green tattoo of a rose branch. The distinctive tattoo had identified him when he was arrested. Woods was pronounced dead on September 13, 2011 at 6:22pm.[15] Woods' was the 10th execution carried out in Texas in 2011[16] and the 474th since Texas resumed the death penalty in 1982.

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple  professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse  portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each  professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialized professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in

How do I find the best  architect for my home design project?It is best to hire a home architect who will be involved in all phases of the design process, from the initial concept to the completed construction. The architect is often the first person you will hire for your project. If necessary, they might also help you select and hire  subcontractors, which can include the builders, engineers and landscaper. Interior architects are also involved in negotiating contracts for all involved participants. It is for these reasons that it is extremely important for you to have a good relationship with the  residential architect you hire. He or she can be the tie-breaking vote between you and the general contractor and can be your biggest advocate during the construction process. Different architecture firms  provide different services, so the scope of the work can span from pre-design environmental impact studies to selecting furniture and finishes, depending on what your specific needs are.What sort of process can I expect from a residential architect?As far as the process goes, the architecture firm or individual that you choose will start with concept drawings and finish with construction drawings and documents. Some firms even design with 3D renderings and videos, but that should not be assumed. There should be plenty of meetings between you and your building designer until you have agreed upon a design that you are completely happy with. Always keep in mind that the designer will have building codes to follow, and likely pre-existing design limitations when dealing with a remodel, so while they might not be able to execute your exact ideas they always have your safety and aesthetics in mind.  One of the most important duties of a residential architect is to serve as managers and supervise most aspects of construction, as well as facilitate communication between all other contractors, so you can expect them to be present throughout the entire building process to ensure everything is executed as planned.It is very important to hire the right professional for the job. Remember that the most well-known or established designer might not provide the best architectural services for your needs. It all comes down to the individual project. Research and ask people whose work you like for recommendations. It's important to have somewhat of an idea of the style of house architecture that you prefer, as well as the amount you would like to spend. Residential architects  are natural problem solvers. They will assess the entire situation and help you to solve your problems too. Don't settle for a single company too early. Call and interview a few. Make sure that you feel like your personalities will mesh well and that you like their professional perspective.Questions to ask prospective  interior architects: What is your fee structure? What does the cost include? Do you have professional liability insurance? Can you handle my special requests (ADA, LEED etc.)? What types of renderings (3D, video, illustrative) will you produce? What is your experience with similar projects? When do you expect to start and be finished with the project? What do your services include? (It's best that the services are until construction is completed.) What happens when the cost exceeds the budget? Can you provide me with references? Would you say your work has a defining style? (This is important in case the architect's personal style will interfere with your vision.) Will you help with hiring a general contractor and subcontractors? What do you estimate the cost will be? What will I need to provide? Are there any complications you foresee with this project?Find a home architect  on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to  architects. You may also look through photos of  projects to find interior architects and building designers who have worked on a project similar to yours.  Professional Categories in
