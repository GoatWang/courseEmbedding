INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE



The  investment  objective  of the  Fund  is to  seek  long-term  capital
appreciation.



INVESTMENT ADVISER



Schroder Capital Management International Inc. (the "Investment Adviser")
is a wholly  owned  indirect  subsidiary  of  Schroders  plc,  the London  Stock
Exchange listed holding  company parent of an investment  banking and investment
management  group of companies (the "Schroder  Group") that dates its origins to
1804. The investment  management operations of the Schroder Group are located in
20 countries  worldwide  including 15 offices in emerging markets.  The Schroder
Group has been  managing  international  investment  portfolios  since the early
years of this  century.  As of June 30, 1998,  the Schroder  Group had over $195
billion in assets under  management.  As of September 30, 1998,  the  Investment
Adviser,   together  with  its  U.K.  affiliate,   Schroder  Capital  Management
International  Ltd.,  had  approximately  $24 billion under  management of which
approximately $5.2 billion was invested in dedicated emerging markets mandates.


January 18, 1999


Dear Shareholder:


We are  pleased  to  present  the  semi-annual  report  for the  Schroder
Emerging  Markets Fund for the six months ended November 30, 1998. This past six
months saw markedly divergent  performance among the world's markets, as well as
considerable  volatility  of  performance  within  certain  individual  emerging
markets. A common theme was investors' rising level of risk aversion in response
to economic and financial  shocks,  including Russian debt default and increased
devaluation risk in some emerging markets.  In general, in the first half of the
fiscal year,  economic problems appeared largely contained within Asia and parts
of the  broader  emerging  markets  universe.  In the last fiscal  quarter,  the
turmoil in the  emerging  markets  spread to European  and the U.S.  markets and
these markets also experienced some volatility.


Looking forward, we expect global growth to be slower in 1999 than it was
in 1998, as the contagion from emerging markets  continues to weigh on demand in
developed markets. We believe that this will trim, but not eradicate,  growth in
continental  Europe.  Latin  America is likely to be one of the emerging  market
regions  where  growth is likely to slow most  sharply  next year.  Within Asia,
which experienced a very sharp contraction in 1998, we believe that activity may
be stabilizing,  but further structural  reforms,  especially within the banking
sector, are needed to sustain a significant recovery.


On a more positive note,  monetary  authorities  like the Federal Reserve
and its global  counterparts  were quick to act to forestall  future problems by
lowering interest rates. A growing number of companies,  including many in Asia,
are increasing  their emphasis on  shareholder  value.  This should help to ease
investors'  anxieties  and to trim the risk  premiums  that  have  risen in many
markets,  although we believe  that it is unlikely to return them to levels seen
earlier in the fiscal year.








SCHRODER EMERGING MARKETS FUND





We  expect  further   uncertainty  and  volatility  in  the  year  ahead.
Nevertheless, compelling values exist in many emerging equity markets after this
year's correction, and many high quality stocks have been sold indiscriminately.
We believe  that as  investors  once  again  focus on the  attractive  value now
available  and  on  the  long-term  potential  for  restructuring  and  improved
profitability we will see a revival of interest in emerging markets.  Schroders'
investment  approach stresses the rewards of identifying high quality franchises
with  sustainable  growth  prospects  at  attractive  valuations.   The  present
environment  presents great scope for our extensive  global research  network to
identify such opportunities for the long-term benefit of our investors.


Thank you for your interest in the Schroder Emerging Markets Fund.



Sincerely







/s/ M. J. Smith

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (As of November 30, 1998) (Unaudited)




PERFORMANCE


For the six month period ended  November  30, 1998,  the Schroder  Emerging
Markets  Fund  returned  -12.71%.  its  benchmark,  the Morgan  Stanley  Capital
International Emerging Markets Free (excluding Malaysia) Index, returned -15.26%
over the same period.


Country  allocation  contributed  positively to the Fund's performance over
the period,  specifically an overweight position in Korea and Eastern Europe and
an underweight  position in the troubled  Brazilian and Russian  markets.  Stock
selection on the whole  detracted from  performance.  The Fund invests in larger
companies  with  solid,  long-term  fundamentals,  and it was these more  liquid
stocks that suffered dramatic sell-offs in the last six months as investors fled
the  emerging  markets.  Stock  selection  in Taiwan  and  Thailand  contributed
positively to  performance  and, in Poland,  our  underweight  position in banks
benefited the Fund.



MARKET BACKGROUND


The rolling crisis in emerging markets, which began with the devaluation of
the Thai baht in mid-1997, has since spread to Russia, Latin America and Brazil.
As currency and economic expansion  concerns gradually became global,  investors
became increasingly risk averse.  Capital was withdrawn,  international  lending
and  borrowing  declined  and many  economies  in the  asset  class  stalled  or
contracted.


Greece  and  Portugal  were  least  affected  by the  turbulence  as  their
economies  were  supported by falling  inflation  and low interest  rates.  Both
countries  also  benefited  from their  forthcoming  participation  in  European
Monetary Union (EMU)  (Portugal in 1999;  Greece in 2000).  The crisis in Russia
impacted other countries in Eastern  Europe,  resulting in a decline in investor
sentiment.  Latin America's  current  account  balances came under pressure as a
result of falling  commodity  prices and this was  exacerbated  by a downturn in
capital inflows.


September was a particularly volatile month for global markets,  mainly due
to Brazil's huge budget  deficits.  However,  emerging  markets enjoyed a strong
recovery in October  and  November.  A series of interest  rate cuts by the U.S.
Federal Reserve reduced currency pressures in many emerging markets,  triggering
a market  rally.  The rally  continued  through  November as Brazil  announced a
fiscal  adjustment  and a $41.5  billion  IMF aid  package.  In  Europe  and the
Mediterranean,  however, countries such as Israel and Turkey experienced reduced
capital flows for the first time.



PORTFOLIO REVIEW


Given the weakness in emerging  stock  markets,  we  maintained a defensive
position throughout the six month period. We held unusually high levels of cash,
reducing our cash position in early  October as  confidence in emerging  markets
recovered. We focused on markets in which economic fundamentals remained strong,
such as Poland,  Hungary, and Mediterranean  Europe, and on those countries most
committed to  restructuring.  In particular,  we favored  Korea:  it was already
showing signs of corporate restructuring and bank recapitalization, its interest
rates had  fallen  sharply  and its  currency  was  relatively  stable.  We were
underweight  in countries  with weak economic  fundamentals,  such as Brazil and
South   Africa.   At  the  height  of  the  crisis  in  August,   we   purchased
U.S.$-denominated  bonds in Korea,  Mexico and Argentina as a further  defensive
measure.  We also hedged the Fund's exposure to the Hong Kong dollar, the Polish
zloty and the Brazilian real.


In the midst of these unsettled market conditions,  we focused on companies
with strong balance sheets and sustainable cash flows, such as China Telecom and
Korea Electric Power.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (Unaudited) (concluded)



OUTLOOk


Looking ahead, we favor emerging  Mediterranean  Europe and Africa and Asia
over Latin America.  We believe that weaker  commodity  prices and lower capital
flows into emerging markets will hit Latin America  particularly hard due to its
huge current account deficits, whereas some Asian companies - and most companies
in  Emerging  Mediterranean  Europe - will start to see a recovery  in 1999.  In
particular,  we favor the prospects for Korea,  however, we believe that further
restructuring  and bank  recapitalization  is key to the future direction of its
stock market.


While the outlook for emerging markets has improved, we still have a number
of concerns:  commodity prices in emerging markets remain weak, global growth is
expected  to slow in  1999,  and  the  capital  available  for  emerging  market
companies and governments is scarce. We believe that Brazil is key to the future
of emerging markets, with continued progress on fiscal reform and lower interest
rates  essential  if it is to  avoid  internal  debt  restructuring.  On a  more
positive note,  emerging market companies are trading at a significant  discount
relative to their  developed  market peers at the moment,  representing  what we
believe to be great opportunities for long-term investors.

SCHRODER EMERGING MARKETS FUND








NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)


NOVEMBER 30, 1998






NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION



Schroder Capital Funds (Delaware) (the "Trust") was organized as a Maryland
corporation  on July 30, 1969;  reorganized  as a series company on February 29,
1988, as Schroder  Capital Funds,  Inc. and reorganized on January 9, 1996, as a
Delaware  business  trust.  The  Trust,  which  is  registered  as  an  open-end
management  investment  company  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the
"Act"), currently has nine investment portfolios. Included in this report is the
Schroder  Emerging  Markets  Fund  (the  "Fund"),  which  is  a  non-diversified
portfolio  that  commenced  operations  on  October  31,  1997.  Under its Trust
Instrument,  the Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited  number of the Fund's
Investor  Shares and Advisor  Shares of beneficial  interest  without par value,
which have equal rights as to assets and voting  privileges.  As of November 30,
1998, only Investor Shares had been issued.



MASTER-FEEDER ARRANGEMENT


The Fund seeks to achieve its  investment  objective by  investing  all its
investable  assets in Schroder EM Core Portfolio (the  "Portfolio"),  a separate
non-diversified  portfolio of Schroder Capital Funds ("Schroder  Core") that has
the same investment  objective and substantially  similar investment policies as
the Fund. This is commonly referred to as a master-feeder arrangement.  Schroder
Core also is registered as an open-end management  investment company.  The Fund
may withdraw its investment  from the Portfolio at any time if the Trust's Board
of  Trustees  determines  that it is in the  best  interest  of the Fund and its
shareholders  to do so. The Fund accounts for its investment in the Portfolio as
a partnership  investment and records daily its share of the Portfolio's income,
expenses and realized and  unrealized  gain or loss. The  Portfolio's  financial
statements  are  included  elsewhere  in  this  report  and  should  be  read in
conjunction with the Fund's financial  statements.  As of November 30, 1998, the
Fund owned approximately 4.7% of the interests in the Portfolio.



NOTE 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



These  financial  statements  are  prepared in  accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting   principles  which  require  management  to  make  certain
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial  statements,  and the reported  amounts of increase or decrease in net
assets from  operations  during the fiscal  period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.


The following represents the significant accounting policies of the Fund:



SECURITY VALUATION


The Trust  determines  the net asset  value per share of the Fund as of the
close of trading  on the New York  Stock  Exchange  on each Fund  business  day.
Valuation of  securities  held in the Portfolio is discussed in the Notes to the
Financial Statements of the Portfolio.



INVESTMENT INCOME AND EXPENSES


The Trust  records  daily  its pro rata  share of the  Portfolio's  income,
expenses and realized and unrealized gain or loss. In addition, the Fund accrues
its own expenses.  Investment  income,  realized and unrealized gains or losses,
and the common expenses of the Fund are allocated as accrued on a pro rata basis
to each class of shares based on the relative net assets of each class of shares
to the total net assets of the Fund.



DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS


Net  investment  income and net capital  gain, if any, are  distributed  to
shareholders  at  least  annually  and are  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date.
Distributions  are based on amounts  calculated  in accordance  with  applicable
federal  income  tax  regulations,  which may  differ  from  generally  accepted
accounting  principles.   These  differences  are  due  primarily  to  differing
treatments  of income  and gain on  various  investment  securities  held by the
Portfolio,  timing differences and differing  characterizations of distributions
made by the Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)




FEDERAL TAXES


The Fund intends to qualify,  and  continue to qualify,  each year as a
regulated investment company and distribute all its taxable income. In addition,
by  distributing  in each calendar  year  substantially  all its net  investment
income,  capital gain and certain  other  amounts,  if any, the Fund will not be
subject to  federal  excise  tax.  Therefore,  no  federal  income or excise tax
provision is required.



EXPENSE ALLOCATION


The Trust  accounts  separately  for the  assets  and  liabilities  and
operation of each of its funds.  Expenses that are directly attributable to more
than one fund are  allocated  among the  respective  funds in proportion to each
fund's net assets.  Expenses that are directly attributable to a class of shares
are allocated to that class.



ORGANIZATION COSTS


Costs  incurred by the Fund in  connection  with its  organization  are
amortized on a straight line basis over a five year period.



NOTE 3.  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES




INVESTMENT ADVISER

SCHRODER EM CORE PORTFOLIO








NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)


NOVEMBER 30, 1998






NOTE 1.  ORGANIZATION



Schroder  Capital Funds  ("Schroder  Core") was organized as a Delaware
business trust on September 7, 1995.  Schroder  Core,  which is registered as an
open-end management  investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940
(the "Act"), currently has eight investment portfolios.  Included in this report
is Schroder EM Core  Portfolio  (the  "Portfolio"),  which is a  non-diversified
portfolio  that  commenced  operations  on  October  30,  1997.  Under its Trust
Instrument,  Schroder  Core is  authorized  to  issue  an  unlimited  number  of
interests  without par value.  Interests in the  Portfolio  are sold without any
sales charge in private placement transactions to qualified investors, including
open-end management investment companies.



NOTE 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



These  financial  statements are prepared in accordance  with generally
accepted  accounting   principles  which  require  management  to  make  certain
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of increase and decrease in net
assets from  operations  during the fiscal  period.  Actual results could differ
from those estimates.


The following  represents the  significant  accounting  policies of the
Portfolio:



SECURITY VALUATION


Portfolio securities listed on recognized stock exchanges are valued at
the last  reported  sale  price on the  exchange  on which  the  securities  are
principally traded. Listed securities traded on recognized stock exchanges where
last sale  prices  are not  available  are  valued at the last sale price on the
preceding  trading day or at the mean of the  closing  bid and ask  ("mid-market
price"). Securities traded in over-the-counter markets, or listed securities for
which no trade is reported on the valuation  date, are valued at the most recent
reported mid-market price. Prices used for valuations  generally are provided by
independent pricing services. Domestic short-term investments, having a maturity
of 60 days or less,  are valued at amortized  cost,  which  approximates  market
value.  Foreign  short-term  investments are valued at the current market price,
then marked to market to recognize  any gain or loss on the  transaction.  Other
securities and assets for which market  quotations are not readily available are
valued at fair value as determined  in good faith using methods  approved by the
Schroder  Core's Board of Trustees.  As of November 30, 1998,  the Portfolio did
not hold a position in any fair valued securities.



SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME


Investment  transactions  are  accounted  for on trade  date.  Dividend
income is  recorded on  ex-dividend  date except  that  certain  dividends  from
foreign  securities  where the ex-dividend  date may have passed are recorded as
soon as the Portfolio is informed of the  ex-dividend  date.  Dividend income is
recorded net of unrecoverable  withholding  tax.  Interest income is recorded as
earned.  Identified cost of investments sold is used to determine  realized gain
and loss for both financial  statement and federal income tax purposes.  Foreign
dividend  and  interest  income  amounts and  realized  capital gain or loss are
converted to U.S. dollar  equivalents  using foreign exchange rates in effect on
the date of the transactions.


Foreign  currency  amounts are translated into U.S.  dollars at the mean of
the bid and asked prices of such currencies against U.S. dollars as follows: (i)
assets and  liabilities  at the rate of  exchange  at the end of the  respective
period;  and (ii)  purchases and sales of securities  and income and expenses at
the rate of exchange  prevailing on the dates of such transactions.  The portion
of the results of operations  arising from changes in the exchange rates and the
portion  due to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in the  market  prices of
securities  are not  isolated.  Such  fluctuations  are  included  with  the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

SCHRODER EM CORE PORTFOLIO






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)



The  Portfolio  may enter into  forward  contracts  to purchase or sell
foreign currencies. Risks associated with such contracts include the movement in
value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar and the ability of the
counterparty  to  perform.  Fluctuations  in the  value  of such  contracts  are
recorded  daily as unrealized  gain or loss;  realized gain or loss includes net
gain or loss on contracts that have terminated by settlement or by the Portfolio
entering into offsetting commitments.



REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS


The  Portfolio  may invest in  repurchase  agreements.  The  Portfolio,
through its  custodian,  receives  delivery of the underlying  collateral  whose
market value must always equal or exceed the  repurchase  price.  The investment
adviser is responsible for determining the value of the underlying collateral at
all times. In the event of default, the Portfolio may have difficulties with the
disposition of any securities held as collateral.



EXPENSE ALLOCATION


Schroder Core accounts  separately for the assets and  liabilities  and
operation of each  portfolio.  Expenses that are directly  attributable  to more
than one portfolio are allocated  among the respective  portfolios in proportion
to each portfolio's net assets.



ORGANIZATION COSTS


Costs incurred by the Portfolio in connection with its organization are
being amortized on a straight line basis over a five-year period.



NOTE 3.  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES




INVESTMENT ADVISER


Schroder  Capital   Management   International  Inc.  ("SCMI")  is  the
investment  adviser  to  the  Portfolio.  Pursuant  to  an  Investment  Advisory
Agreement, SCMI is entitled to receive from Schroder EM Core Portfolio an annual
fee, payable monthly, of 1.00% of the Portfolio's average daily net assets.



ADMINISTRATOR AND SUBADMINISTRATOR


The  administrator  of the  Portfolio is Schroder  Fund  Advisors  Inc.
("Schroder  Advisors") which entitles Schroder Advisors to receive  compensation
at an annual rate,  payable monthly,  of 0.10% of the Portfolio's  average daily
net  assets.  The  subadministrator  of the  Portfolio  is Forum  Administrative
Services,  LLC ("FAdS").  FAdS is entitled to receive  compensation at an annual
rate,  payable monthly,  of 0.075% of the Portfolio's  average daily net assets,
subject to an annual minimum of $25,000 for its services.



OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS


Forum Accounting  Services,  LLC ("FAcS") performs portfolio accounting
services  for the  Portfolio  and is  entitled to receive  compensation  for its
services in the amount of $60,000 per year,  plus certain other  charges,  based
upon the  number  and  types  of  portfolio  transactions.  FAcS  also  provides
interestholder  record  keeping  services to the Portfolio for which it receives
$12,000 per year, plus certain other charges.

SCHRODER EM CORE PORTFOLIO






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)




NOTE 4.  PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES



The  cost of  securities  purchased  and the  proceeds  from  sales  of
securities (excluding  short-term  securities) for the period ended November 30,
1998, were $9,062,966 and $19,491,649, respectively.


For federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of investment securities
owned  as of  November  30,  1998,  was  $11,052,557,  and  the  net  unrealized
depreciation  of  investment   securities  was  $68,590.   The  aggregate  gross
unrealized  appreciation  for all  securities  in which  there  was an excess of
market value over tax cost was $1,486,041,  and the aggregate  gross  unrealized
depreciation  for all  securities  in which there was an excess of tax cost over
market value was $1,554,631.



NOTE 5.  FEDERAL TAXES



The  Portfolio  is not  required to pay  federal  income tax on its net
investment  income and net capital gain  because it is treated as a  partnership
for federal income tax purposes.  All interest,  dividends,  gain or loss of the
Portfolio  is  deemed  to  have  been  "passed   through"  to  the   Portfolio's
interestholders in proportion to their holdings of the Portfolio,  regardless of
whether such interest, dividends or gain has been distributed by the Portfolio.


Under the applicable foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on
interest, dividends, and capital gains at various rates.



NOTE 6.  WAIVER OF FEES AND REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES



For the period ended November 30, 1998, SCMI,  Schroder Advisors,  and FAdS
voluntarily  waived  fees of  $63,973,  $6,397,  and  $7,702,  respectively.  In
addition, Schroder Advisors reimbursed expenses in the amount of $34,535.



NOTE 7.  CONCENTRATION OF RISK



The  Portfolio  may invest more than 25% of its total assets in issuers
located in any one  country.  To the extent  that it does so, the  Portfolio  is
susceptible  to a range of factors  that could  adversely  affect that  country,
including  political  and  economic   developments  and  foreign   exchange-rate
fluctuations.  As a result of investing  substantially in one country, the value
of the Portfolio's  assets may fluctuate more widely than the value of shares of
a  comparable  fund  with a  lesser  degree  of  geographic  concentration.  The
Portfolio  invests in countries  with  limited or  developing  capital  markets.
Investments in these markets may involve greater risks than  investments in more
developed markets.

PROPOSAL I: ELECTION OF TRUSTEES OF THE TRUSTS. 
At the Meeting, shareholders will vote on a proposal to elect four nominees to serve as Trustees of each Trust. With the recent departure of a long-time Trustee and the anticipated retirement of another long-time Trustee who is approaching the Trusts’ retirement age, this election will assure that the Trusts continue to have highly-qualified, independent Trustees overseeing the Funds. The election will also assure continued compliance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), requiring that a majority of the Trustees of each Trust be elected by shareholders. 
Persons named in the accompanying proxy card intend in the absence of contrary instructions to vote all proxies for the election of the nominees listed below:

The Board of Trustees of each Trust has determined to submit to shareholders each of the nominees for election as Trustee named above. Ms. Catherine A. Mazza and Mr. James D. Vaughn are current Trustees of each of the Trusts. Mr. Calhoun and Ms. Cannella are not currently Trustees of the Trusts. Mr. William D. Means is also a current Trustee of each Trust. If the candidates are elected, Mr. Means is expected to resign as Trustee effective in March 2011 as he is approaching the Trusts’ retirement age. 
In accordance with each Trust’s Declaration of Trust or Trust Instrument, as applicable, each nominee, if elected, will serve until he or she retires, resigns, is removed or dies or until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Each of the persons named above has consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve as a Trustee of each Trust if elected. The election of each of the persons named above as a Trustee of a Trust will require the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes of that Trust’s shareholders cast at the Meeting. The Trustees have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will become unavailable to
serve as a Trustee. If, however, any of the nominees become unavailable to serve before the Meeting, then the persons named in the proxy cards will vote for such other persons as the Trustees may nominate.

THE BOARDS OF TRUSTEES 
The Boards of Trustees 
The Board of Trustees of each Trust is currently comprised of three Trustees, two of whom are Disinterested Trustees. Ms. Mazza, an interested Trustee, serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of each Trust. The Trustees of the Trusts have not designated a lead Disinterested Trustee. A Trustee may be elected either by the Trustees of the applicable Trust or by the shareholders of the applicable Trust. The number of Trustees of each Trust is fixed from time to time by the Trustees but may not be less than three or, for Schroder Capital Funds (Delaware), more than 12. Each Trustee shall serve until he or she retires, resigns, is removed or dies or
until the next meeting of shareholders called for the purpose of electing Trustees and until the election and qualification of his or her successor. At any meeting called for the purpose, a Trustee may be removed by vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the applicable Trust.

The Board of Trustees of each Trust has adopted a committee structure, which allows it to perform more effectively its oversight function for the Funds. Each Board of Trustees currently has two committees: the Audit Committee and the Nominating Committee. Each of those committees is currently composed of all of the Disinterested Trustees of the applicable Trust (currently, Messrs. Means and Vaughn), allowing all the disinterested Trustees to participate in the full range of each Board of Trustees’ oversight duties. The committees report regularly to the Boards of Trustees. See “Committees of the Boards of Trustees” below for more
information. 
In connection with its oversight of each Trust, each Board of Trustees also oversees each Trust’s management and risk management processes. With respect to management, executive officers of the Trusts, including the President and Principal 

14

 
 


Executive Officer, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief Compliance Officer, are elected by the Boards of Trustees in accordance with the applicable Trust’s by-laws, provided that the Chief Compliance Officer must be approved by a majority of the disinterested Trustees. Each of the President, the Treasurer, and the Clerk shall hold office until he or she dies, resigns, is removed or becomes disqualified, and each other officer of each Trust shall hold office at the pleasure of the Trustees of the applicable Trust. A Trust’s Board of Trustees may remove any officer of that Trust at any time, with or without
cause, provided that a majority of the disinterested Trustees must approve the removal of the Chief Compliance Officer. In connection with performing its oversight function with respect to risk management, the Boards of Trustees receive regular reports from Schroders and from executive officers of the Trusts, including but not limited to the President and Principal Executive Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal Officer, on a variety of matters. These reports include specific information on risk oversight by Schroders, activities of Schroders’s risk committee, activities of the valuation committee, results of operational and compliance testing on the Funds, the performance of the Funds and their use of certain instruments, including restricted and illiquid securities, derivatives, and borrowings. Each Trust has determined that its leadership and committee structure is appropriate for the Funds and the applicable Trust
in light of
the size of the Trust and the Schroders fund complex, and reviews the effectiveness of its committee structure at least annually. 
Committees of the Boards of Trustees 
Audit Committee.  Each Board of Trustees has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is responsible for overseeing financial and accounting matters. Each Audit Committee is composed of all of the Disinterested Trustees of the applicable Trust (currently, Messrs. Vaughn and Means). The Audit Committees provide oversight with respect to the internal and external accounting and auditing procedures of the Trusts and, among other things, consider the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm for each
Trust (“independent accountants”), determine the scope of the audits, approve all audit and permitted non-audit services proposed to be performed by those independent accountants on behalf of the Trusts, and consider other services provided by those independent accountants to the Trusts, Schroders and its affiliates, and the possible effect of those services on the independence of those independent accountants. Each Audit Committee met three times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009. 
Nominating Committee.  Each Board of Trustees has a Nominating Committee, which is responsible for recommending individuals to the Board of each Trust for nomination as members of such Board. All of the Disinterested Trustees (currently, Messrs. Vaughn and Means) serve on the applicable Trust’s Nominating Committee. Each Nominating Committee identifies individuals qualified to serve as Trustees, recommends individuals to be appointed to the applicable Trust’s Board or 

15

 
 


to be proposed as nominees for election by shareholders, and sets standards or qualifications for service on the Boards of Trustees. The Nominating Committees consider a wide variety of factors in evaluating Trustee candidates, including but not limited to, the individual’s availability and commitment to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities, relevant industry and related experience, educational background, financial experience, an assessment of his or her ability, judgment and expertise, and the overall diversity of the Board’s composition. Each Nominating Committee will consider nominees properly submitted by shareholders
on the same basis as it considers candidates recommended by other sources. Nominee recommendations may be submitted to the Secretary/Clerk of each Trust at the Trusts’ principal business address. Shareholder recommendations must be delivered or mailed to and received by a Trust not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days prior to the Board meeting at which the nominee would be elected. The Nominating Committee met once during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2009. Additional information regarding Nominating Committee procedures is available in the Nominating Committee’s Charter attached as Exhibit A.

Shareholder Communications 
Shareholders may send communications to the Boards of Trustees. Shareholders should send communications intended for the Trustees by addressing the communication directly to the Trustees (or individual Trustees) and/or otherwise clearly indicating in the salutation that the communication is for the Trustees (or individual Trustees) and by sending the communication to such Trustees at the address specified for each Trustee above. The President of the applicable Trust shall either provide a copy of each properly submitted shareholder communication to the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting or forward the communication to the Trustees promptly
after receipt or may, in good faith, determine that the shareholder communication should not be provided to the Board because it does not reasonably relate to the Trust or its operations, management, activities, policies, service providers, Board, officers, shareholders or other matters relating to an investment in any constituent series of the Trust or is otherwise immaterial in nature. Other shareholder communications received by the Trusts not directly addressed and sent to the Trustees will be reviewed and generally responded to by management, and will be forwarded to the Trustees only at management’s discretion based on the matters contained therein.

Required Vote 
Approval of Proposal I with respect to a Trust requires the affirmative vote of shareholders owning of record a plurality of such Trust’s shares voting at a meeting of shareholders. 
Quorum 
For Schroder Series Trust and Schroder Global Series Trust, thirty percent of the shares of each Trust entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for purposes of voting for the election of Trustees. For Schroder Capital Funds (Delaware) one-third of the shares of the Trust entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for purposes of voting for the election of Trustees.


26

 
 


Other Business 
The Trustees know of no other business to be brought before the Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Meeting, it is the Trustees’ intention that proxies that do not contain specific restrictions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in accordance with the judgment of the persons named as proxies in the enclosed form of proxy card(s). 
Solicitation of Proxies 
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, the Trustees of the Trusts and employees of Schroders or its affiliates may solicit proxies in person, by telephone or over the internet. The Trusts have retained the proxy communications and solicitation advisory firm of D.F. King, 48 Wall Street, 22nd Floor, New York, NY 10005, to aid in the solicitation of proxies. To make voting faster and more convenient for you, the Trusts are offering the option of voting on the internet or by telephone instead of completing and mailing the enclosed applicable proxy card(s). Either method is generally available 24 hours a day, and your vote will be
confirmed and posted immediately. If you choose to vote via the internet or by phone, do not mail the proxy card. 
Ways To Vote: 



•
To vote on the internet 





1.

2.
Go to website specified on your proxy card. 





3.

4.

•
To vote by touch-tone telephone 





1.

2.
Call the toll-free number specified on your proxy card. 





3.
Enter the control number on your proxy card. 





4.
Follow the recorded instructions. 





•

3.

4.

In addition to voting by the internet, touch-tone telephone or mail, you may give your voting instructions over the telephone by calling 1-800-893-5874. A


27

 
 


representative of D.F. King will answer your call. When receiving your instructions by telephone, the D.F. King representative is required to ask you for your full name, address, a portion of your social security or employer identification number, title (if the person giving the proxy is authorized to act for an entity, such as a corporation), and to confirm that you have received this proxy statement in the mail. If the information you provide matches the information provided to D.F. King by Schroders, then the D.F. King representative will explain the process. D.F. King is not permitted to recommend to you how to vote, other than to read any
recommendations included in this proxy statement. D.F. King will record your instructions and send you a letter or mailgram to confirm your vote. That letter will also ask you to call D.F. King immediately if the confirmation does not reflect your instructions correctly. You may receive a call from a representative of D.F. King if Schroders has not yet received your vote. D.F. King will record all instructions it receives from shareholders by telephone, and the proxies it signs in accordance with those instructions, in accordance with the procedures set forth above. The Trusts believe that those procedures are reasonably designed to determine accurately the shareholder’s identity and voting instructions. You may also choose to attend the Meeting and vote your proxies in person. 
However you choose to vote, it is important that you vote to save the expense of additional solicitations. The costs of retaining D.F. King and other expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Funds. The anticipated cost associated with the solicitation of proxies by D.F. King for the Proposals and related costs is approximately $9,200.

Adjournment 
In the event that sufficient votes in favor of the Proposals set forth in the accompanying Notice are not received by the time scheduled for the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting for a reasonable time after the date set for the original Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies with respect to the proposal. In addition, if, in the judgment of the persons named as proxies, subsequent developments make it advisable to defer action on the proposals, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting for a reasonable time in order to defer action on the
proposals as they deem advisable. Thirty percent of the shares entitled to vote on a particular matter shall be a quorum for the transaction of business on that matter at a shareholders’ meeting for Schroder Series Trust and Schroder Global Series Trust and one-third of the shares entitled to vote on a particular matter shall be a quorum for the transaction of business on that matter at a shareholders’ meeting for Schroder Capital Funds (Delaware)); any lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments. The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of such adjournment all shares which those persons are entitled to vote in favor of any nominee. They will vote against any such adjournment all shares they are not entitled to vote in favor of any nominee. 

28

 
 


Tabulation of Votes 
Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be counted by one or more persons appointed by the President of the applicable Trust to act as tellers for the Meeting. The tellers will count the total number of votes cast “FOR” the proposal for purposes of determining whether sufficient affirmative votes have been cast. The tellers will count shares represented by proxies that withhold authority to vote or that reflect “broker non-votes” (i.e., shares held by brokers or nominees as to which (i) instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and (ii) the broker or nominee does
not have the discretionary voting power on a particular matter) as shares that are present and entitled to vote on the matter for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of Trustees or votes on adjournment.

Date for Receipt of Shareholders’ Proposals for Meetings of Shareholders 
The Trusts’ Declarations of Trust or Trust Instrument, as applicable, do not provide for annual meetings of shareholders, and each Trust does not currently intend to hold such a meeting in 2010. Shareholder proposals for inclusion in the Trusts’ proxy statement for any meeting must be received by the applicable Trust a reasonable period of time prior to when the applicable Trust begins to print and send its proxy materials. The Trusts’ procedures provide that shareholder recommendations must be delivered or mailed to and received by a Trust not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days prior to the Board meeting at which the nominee
would be elected.

Exhibit A 
Schroder Capital Funds (Delaware),
Schroder Series Trust and Schroder Global Series Trust Nominating Committee Charter 
SCHRODER CAPITAL FUNDS (DELAWARE)
SCHRODER SERIES TRUST
SCHRODER GLOBAL SERIES TRUST 
Nominating Committee Charter 
(Adopted as of May 11, 2004) 
The Board of Trustees (each, a “Board”) of each of Schroder Capital Funds (Delaware), Schroder Series Trust and Schroder Global Series Trust (each, a “Trust”) has adopted this Charter to govern the activities of the Nominating Committee (the “Committee”) of each Board. 
Statement of Purposes and Responsibilities 
The primary purposes and responsibilities of the Committee are (i) to identify individuals qualified to become a Trustee in the event that a position is vacated or created, and to recommend Trustee appointments to the Board, (ii) to select, or to recommend that the Board select, the Trustee nominees for election at a meeting of shareholders, and (iii) to set any necessary standards or qualifications for service on the Board.

Organization and Governance 
The Committee shall be comprised of as many Trustees as the Board shall determine, but in any event not less than two (2) Trustees. The Committee must consist entirely of Trustees who are not “interested persons” of the Trust (“Independent Trustees”), as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Board may remove or replace any member of the Committee at any time in its sole discretion. 
One or more members of the Committee may be designated by the Board as the Committee’s chairman or co-chairman, as the case may be. 
The Committee will not have regularly scheduled meetings. Committee meetings shall be held as and when the Committee or the Board determines necessary or appropriate in accordance with the Trust’s Bylaws. 
Qualifications for Trustee Nominees 
The Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering Trustee candidates, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board,


A-1

 
 


(ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) financial expertise, (v) an assessment of the candidate’s ability, judgment and expertise and (v) overall diversity of the Board’s composition. 
Identification of Nominees 
In identifying potential nominees for the Board, the Committee may consider candidates recommended by one or more of the following sources: (i) the Trust’s current Trustees, (ii) the Trust’s officers, (ii) the Trust’s investment adviser or any subadviser, (iv) the Trust’s shareholders (see below) and (v) any other source the Committee deems to be appropriate. The Committee may, but is not required to, retain a third party search firm at the Trust’s expense to identify potential candidates. 
Consideration of Candidates Recommended By Shareholders 
The Committee will consider and evaluate nominee candidates properly submitted by shareholders on the same basis as it considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources. Appendix A to this Charter, as it may be amended from time to time by the Committee, sets forth procedures that must be followed by shareholders to properly submit a nominee candidate to the Committee. Recommendations not properly submitted in accordance with Appendix A will not be considered by the Committee.


A-2

 
 


Appendix A 
Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee Candidates
  (As of May 11, 2004) 
A shareholder of any series of a Trust must follow the following procedures in order to properly submit a nominee recommendation for the Committee’s consideration. 



1.
The shareholder must submit any such recommendation (a “Shareholder Recommendation”) in writing to the Trust, to the attention of the Trust’s Secretary/Clerk, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Trust. 





2.

Schroders Grows Mutual Fund Line-up with Launch of Two New Funds
Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund and Short Duration Bond Fund Support Firm's Commitment to Provide a diverse range of Mutual Fund Products for Investors

September 09, 2015 08:38

NEW YORK, Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. announces the launch of two new mutual funds, the Schroder Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund and Schroder Short Duration Bond Fund, as the firm continues its commitment to provide investment capabilities in various vehicles that meet our clients' needs.The Schroder Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund, available in Investor Shares (Symbol: SMLNX) and R6 Shares (Symbol: SMLRX), takes advantage of the firm's expansive global footprint and equity market expertise."We believe our unparalleled emerging markets franchise combined with our global capabilities and insights on specific companies provide a unique opportunity for U.S. investors," said Thomas Darnowski, Head of Product Development at Schroders in the US. "The fund looks to capitalize on the sheer scope of our international coverage and affords shareholders a powerful alternative for seeking access to the many growth prospects that exist outside the developed markets."The Schroder Short Duration Bond Fund, also available in Investor Shares (Symbol: SDBNX) and R6 Shares (Symbol: SDBRX), seeks long-term total return consistent with the preservation of capital and rounds out Schroders' ability to solve for a wider range of fixed income objectives."The Short Duration Bond Fund provides an excellent option for investors looking to allocate resources across shorter maturities in order to defensively manage a changing rate environment," said Darnowski. "Both of our new funds benefit from tremendous market insight, and well-established management within their respective asset classes."The Schroder Emerging Markets Small Cap Fund is managed by Allan Conway, Matthew Dobbs, James Gotto and Richard Sennitt, with the support of 37 investment professionals across the Emerging Markets Equity team and Global Small Cap and Specialist Asia team. The Schroder Short Duration Bond Fund is managed by Andrew B.J. Chorlton, Edward H. Jewett, Richard A. Rezek Jr., Julio C. Bonilla and Neil G. Sutherland, with over 24 years average investment experience and supported by a global network of over 80 fixed income investment professionals around the world.Introduced earlier this year, Schroders' R6 share class is a "clean" fee share class with no embedded shareholder servicing fees, providing more competitively priced products to Schroders' eligible institutional clients. The new share class delivers on Schroders' commitment to provide investment solutions aligned with clients' goals and to ensure they are priced appropriately for the firm's clients in the institutional and retirement markets.For further information, please contact:Steven Bodakowski of JCPR at 646-922-7773 or sbodakowski@jcprinc.com  Jennifer Manser of Schroders at 212-632-2947 or Jennifer.Manser@schroders.comAbout Schroder Investment Management North America Inc.Schroder Investment Management North America Inc. is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Schroders plc (SDR.L), a global asset management company with approximately $487.4 billion under management as of June 30, 2015.

Schroders expands securitized credit capability through acquisition of ABS and MBS team from Brookfield

05/16/2016


















New York, May 16, 2016— Schroders has reached an agreement with Brookfield Investment Management Inc. to acquire its securitized products investment management team with more than $4 billion in assets under management.
The team is led by Michelle Russell-Dowe, Managing Director and Head of Securitized Products Investments at Brookfield, and will combine with Schroders’ existing New York based ABS team. The combined team will oversee more than $8 billion, with significant capacity for further growth.
The team also manages an Irish qualifying investor alternative investment fund (QIAIF), which will become an important component of the firm’s extension into alternative investments. These assets will be managed under the Schroders brand, with full access to the firm’s asset management platform, economists, research and risk management capabilities.
Karl Dasher CEO North America and Co-Head of Fixed Income at Schroders said: 
“This acquisition deepens our capabilities in one of the largest and most research intensive credit sectors globally. The process developed by Michelle and her team over two decades has delivered one of the longest and strongest track records in the sector with an extensive network of industry relationships. This will strengthen our investment capability for both US and non-US investors seeking higher return opportunities within fixed income.”
Michelle Russell-Dowe Managing Director and Head of Securitized Products Investments at Brookfield said:
“Our team is very excited to become part of Schroders. We feel the organization, investment approach and environment will be a great fit for our team and our clients, which will benefit from the deep resources and capabilities Schroders has to offer globally. We look forward to working with Schroders to build on the exciting opportunities available in a changing fixed income landscape.”
Schroders has a diversified and expansive fixed income capability globally, which includes credit, multi-sector, rates, emerging market debt, municipals, convertibles, currencies and has now enhanced its existing ABS and MBS capabilities. The Fixed Income team manages over $125 billion* in assets under management across the regions and is supported by an investment staff of over 150 individuals including portfolio management, research, analytics, risk and product and portfolio management.  
Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed and it is expected to complete in the third quarter of 2016.
