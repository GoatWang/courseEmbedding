              Abstract




Reaching and manipulating things above normal reach height is important for independent living, especially for many elderly because of reduced functional reach heights. Yet, current products (e.g., step stools) are poorly designed to meet the needs of many elderly and themselves present a fall hazard that could result in injury and greater needs for assistive care. This project will develop more appropriate reaching aids and climbing devices and integrate them into a single product that will be easier and safer to use without assistance. The project will develop a commercially viable product(s) for the elderly that will significantly enhance safety, and independence. It is based on design criteria, developed in Phase 1, which address the capabilities and needs of older users as the present inadequate products do not. The proposed products are two step stool designs, reacher features, and other features designed for an integrated climbing/reaching product. The proposed product(s) will be marketable to elderly with a wide range of capabilities, and addresses a concern recognized by both elderly and family caregivers.

Heart of Hampstead – by Neil Lerner Kitchen Design
May 5, 2016By Linda Parker


Neil Lerner designed this spacious, equipment-packed kitchen for clients who entertain large numbers on a regular basis

Neil Lerner
Neil Lerner was invited to design this large and spacious kitchen in Hampstead, North London for clients he had previously worked with. ‘They were happy to come back to me and my team’ explains Neil, ‘we had also designed their three previous kitchens!’.

Q: What were the client’s priorities in the original brief?
This Hampstead house has a very peaceful and calm location, and was built in 1916, with a country-cottage style. The owners originally wanted to take this feeling into the kitchen. However, once they moved in, they realised that many views of the heath were blocked, as the ground floor was made up of lots of small rooms which simply didn’t work within the brief.

Q: How did you set about fulfilling the brief?
To open up the kitchen and make it into one larger space with enough room for a family dining table, we had to take down a large chimney breast. They also removed an old porch, a second staircase and passage that went nowhere. They opened up the link between the kitchen and former breakfast room, converting it into a comfortable family room with exposed wall made of reclaimed brick for added character.

Q: What were the owner’s priorities, design-wise?
As someone who enjoys cooking and entertaining (twenty-four for dinner is a regular Friday night occurrence), this client had a very clear list of requirements. She worked closely together with the team at the beginning of the project to plan the storage, surfaces and working spaces in meticulous detail. Consequently, every area of the kitchen works well and makes her preparation and cooking tasks easier.

The large central island forms both the main preparation zone and the sociable area, with its sweeping breakfast bar, bridged across one side. The cooking zone has an induction hob, built-in ovens and integrated fridge running along one wall, and there are further sections of tall storage cabinets, a double pantry cupboard and integrated freezer. The owner also specified a drinks station close to the dining table, with roller shutters to conceal a coffee machine, mugs and glassware. Of course, it looks good, but it’s also perfect for concealing teenage mess!

Q: Explain the reasons for your suggestions for cabinetry and work surfaces …
I suggested a blend of softly coloured Cashmere doors, with rich brown Woodlands worktops and an Acacia Grey breakfast bar for added warmth and contrast. We also used the Acacia Grey to frame some of the wall units in the living room. This simple step introduced more character and balance to the overall design, which was continued through to other areas – such as the bespoke shelving to house the client’s vintage model car collection, and of course also gave additional continuity to the overall scheme.

Q: What is your best advice to your clients when starting out on a new project?
When embarking on a new project with a new client, I always encourage them to take their time, and to be sure they fully understand and feel happy with their kitchen design – before a single cabinet is ordered. Once the kitchen is on site, any major changes can become very costly and disruptive, so we aim to cover all bases well in advance to avoid any unforeseen issues arising. We were happy to be asked to work on this project – the client has had several kitchens from us before and the formula clearly works, because we are delighted to say that they keep coming back for more!”

We Love: The space and open feel of this kitchen and the way it eases into the family room, plus the fact that there is plenty of work surface area for a serious chef, and a super-useful mixer lift feature.

Promotion for Senior Designer at Neil Lerner Eve Turner has been promoted to Design Director at Neil Lerner Kitchen Design, London’s leading independent kitchen studio.
Eve Turner has been at Neil Lerner Kitchen Design for 14 years, most recently as the showroom’s Senior Designer. During that time, she has designed a plethora of stylish, contemporary kitchens, ranging from challenging compact spaces to large open plan kitchen/living areas.
Eve’s background is firmly in art & design. Her working life began as an Illustrator for Kitchen Company, Clive Christians in Brentwood. Essex whilst still at Art College, moving into kitchen design in central London’s Wigmore Street as a natural career progression after leaving college.
With her experienced eye and excellent product knowledge of the popular Neil Lerner furniture brand, Eve’s trademark designs incorporate many thoughtful and skilful details, tailored to clients’ specific requirements.
Using the Fusion 3D System, Eve plans each new kitchen in conjunction with the client in order to achieve the desired look. Every area is thoroughly considered to ensure sufficient inclusion of large amounts of storage capacity & appliances, all cleverly concealed within seemingly minimalistic layouts.
In her work, Eve credits the support of the team at Neil Lerner Kitchen Design, specifically Neil with whom she has worked for 14 years. Eve also values input from Technical Director, Chris for his specialist knowledge and help with the more complex design details as well as Hannah who assists with inputting and interpreting the design data on screen for planning and presentations.
Eve’s promotion to Design Director reflects her valuable contribution to the business and her significant talent for designing kitchens.  Over the years, our clients have been consistently impressed with her skills in bringing a fusion of new ideas to life within supremely original and contemporary designs.
— Neil Lerner

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first quote you receive. Comparing multiple London professionals' quotes and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location. Browse London portfolio photos, read client reviews and contact each  home improvement professional for more information. Check out the information in the specialised professional sections too for tips on how to hire the right professional for your project.  Professional Categories in London

Before you hire a London kitchen designer, know what you want from your new fitted kitchen. List your priorities according to what you use your kitchen for, whether it’s primarily cooking or also dining and entertaining. Prep space on worktops and ample storage are the primary factors when designing a kitchen, but layout is equally crucial. Kitchen designers can advise on important considerations such as a work triangle, which is essential to an efficient cooking space. A kitchen designer will likely begin by asking questions about how you use your kitchen space and then apply their architectural and technological expertise to your vision of a dream kitchen to turn it into a space that serves your needs. This may involve contracting other professionals, including experienced London kitchen fitters, plumbers and electricians to carry out specialist work, so rely on your designer’s industry contacts and know-how. Or, some kitchen professionals offer installation in-house and employ kitchen fitters in London themselves to carry out the fitting of your specially designed kitchen.What should I look for with kitchen fitters in London?Once you have your perfect kitchen design, your kitchen designer may be able to introduce you to qualified kitchen fitters in London or you may want to look for one yourself. If you decide to find your own kitchen fitters in London, then it is important to look for someone with specialist experience in fitting kitchens as they are extremely complicated and are easily damaged during installation. Your kitchen is intended to last for many years and is often a huge investment, so you don't want to let things slip at point of installation! A fitter that specialises in fitting kitchens will do much more than simply fit the kitchen in place – they will consider practical aspects of kitchen installation like the best place to put a stop cock for those kitchen water emergencies. Be sure to get references for your London kitchen fitters and ideally complete a site visit on a recent installation project. It could be that your kitchen design company employs their own kitchen fitters in London, but always ask for testimonials and do background checks first.Questions to ask kitchen designers and fitters in London: May I see your portfolio of previous work? What type of education and experience do you have in kitchen design? Are you and your employees licensed and insured? What license(s) do you have? What other training and affiliations do you have? How long will the redesign take to complete? Will you provide any cost-saving ideas? Do you design ecofriendly kitchens? Can I add in green kitchen features? How long have you been in the business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? Do you employ kitchen fitters within your company or do you work with third party kitchen installers? Can you provide me with references? May I see a current project? How do you charge, and what does that include? Can you give me a written estimate? How will I be charged for parts and materials? When are you available to begin work? What is your policy for change orders? What happens when cost exceeds the budget? What about changes to materials or labour pricing? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a kitchen fitter or designer on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to London kitchen designers. You can also look through London photos to find a kitchen or bathroom you like, then contact the kitchen designers or kitchen fitters in London who worked on it. Professional Categories in London
