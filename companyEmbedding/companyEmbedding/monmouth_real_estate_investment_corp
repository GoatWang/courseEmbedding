Easily access high-quality real estate deals.
High Returns
LendingHome’s high-yield real estate assets have returns that range from 8% to 10%. We fund all of our loans before they become available to you as investments, so you start earning interest from the very first day you invest.
Backed by Real Assets
We source creditworthy real estate professionals looking for short-term mortgages of 12 months or less to be used for purchasing and rehabilitating homes. These mortgages are backed by the underlying value of the properties that they fund.
Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.
Build a Diversified Portfolio With the Click of a Button
Our online platform makes it easy to build a diverse real estate portfolio. The AutoInvest feature can do the work for you, spreading out your investment across a variety of fractional notes based on your preferences. Or, customize your portfolio by selecting individual loans on your own.
Easy Access
Individuals can access LendingHome’s opportunities with as little as $5,000 per investment and none of the fees of traditional real estate investing. Once you’ve built a portfolio, you’ll get on-demand updates on its performance.



"Unlike other FinTech platforms that offer investments backed by unsecured loans, LendingHome provides an opportunity to participate in the market for senior secured, collateralized mortgage loans backed by real assets."

Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation
At Monmouth, we are not striving to be the largest company. Our goal is to be a better company. Our focus is always on the long term, for that which is of lasting value takes time.
 






At Monmouth, we are not striving to be the largest company. Our goal is to be a better company. Our focus is always on the long term, for that which is of lasting value takes time.






Who We Are
Digital technology has been reshaping the world in profound ways. Our planet has effectively been shrinking. Consumer spending has continued to migrate to the Internet where one can purchase anything, anytime, anywhere. The conventional ways of conducting commerce no longer apply. The opportunities will be found by those who understand this new world order. From a real estate standpoint, the direct beneficiary of this paradigm shift has been, and will continue to be, the industrial property type.
Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation (MREIC) is one of the oldest publicly traded REITs in the world. Our longevity is the direct result of being patient and conservative stewards of capital. The decision-making process here is guided by an appreciation for all that has been built in the past and a focus on continuing to deliver sustainable long-term results for many years to come.
Formed in 1968, we are one of the most specialized REITs. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased industrial properties on long-term leases, to investment-grade tenants. We have assembled a best-in-class industrial property portfolio with an all-star tenant roster that includes Anheuser-Busch, Beam Suntory, Cardinal Health, Coca-Cola, FedEx, General Electric, Home Depot, International Paper, Kellogg’s, National Oilwell Varco, Sherwin-Williams, Siemens, ULTA Cosmetics, United Technologies, and others.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Institutional Quality
You can access the same mortgage platform trusted by some of the largest credit funds in the world. Our credit guidelines have been fully vetted by our institutional investors, and we do an in-depth analysis of each mortgage.

At Monmouth, we are not striving to be the largest company. Our goal is to be a better company. Our focus is always on the long term, for that which is of lasting value takes time.






Who We Are
Digital technology has been reshaping the world in profound ways. Our planet has effectively been shrinking. Consumer spending has continued to migrate to the Internet where one can purchase anything, anytime, anywhere. The conventional ways of conducting commerce no longer apply. The opportunities will be found by those who understand this new world order. From a real estate standpoint, the direct beneficiary of this paradigm shift has been, and will continue to be, the industrial property type.
Monmouth Real Estate Investment Corporation (MREIC) is one of the oldest publicly traded REITs in the world. Our longevity is the direct result of being patient and conservative stewards of capital. The decision-making process here is guided by an appreciation for all that has been built in the past and a focus on continuing to deliver sustainable long-term results for many years to come.
Formed in 1968, we are one of the most specialized REITs. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased industrial properties on long-term leases, to investment-grade tenants. We have assembled a best-in-class industrial property portfolio with an all-star tenant roster that includes Anheuser-Busch, Beam Suntory, Cardinal Health, Coca-Cola, FedEx, General Electric, Home Depot, International Paper, Kellogg’s, National Oilwell Varco, Sherwin-Williams, Siemens, ULTA Cosmetics, United Technologies, and others.

How to Invest in Real Estate - Complete 2017 Guide
04 14 2017


Investing in real estate is one of the oldest forms of investing, predating the stock market and many other popular investment types. Since the development of property rights, which created the first “defensible property” and the ability to truly sell a property for financial gain, the development and marketing of real estate has been a popular practice, and can be an attractive addition to portfolios for new and seasoned savers alike.
One key reason for its popularity is the numerous forms that investing in real estate types, which range from lending to property management (with many options in between). The plethora of options that prospective real estate investors have at their disposal can be enticing, but any seasoned investor of any type will tell you the kind of research, commitment, and dedication it takes.
However, investing in real estate is also fraught with uncertainty for many individuals, due to a lack of understanding, or a misunderstanding, of the basics: terms, property types, processes, and other fundamentals. Here are a few questions you may have: What is a mortgage agreement? What is a market? What are the different types of commercial property types? How do I get started?
There’s a lot of information to cover. Just like investing in anything else out there, real estate comes with risks and advantages, and it isn’t right for everyone.
Let’s clear this up right away: You should always consult with your financial advisor before making any decisions to pursue real estate as an addition to your portfolio. Your wealth and investment strategies are your own, and your financial advisor is there to help you succeed.
As you go into that discussion to receive guidance and assess your personal investment strategies, it’s always helpful to have some basic research and information under your belt. A robust understanding of the field at large is crucial to create a strong foundation that you can build on with your financial advisor, through your first investments, and over (potentially) many years to come.
How to Invest: A Complete 2017 Guide to Real Estate Investing
Whether you’re involved in commercial real estate investing opportunities or in residential real estate investing opportunities, research and discussion with your financial advisor go hand-in-hand.
We’ve collected some of our own resources in one place, so you can get started on the right foot as you move forward with your financial advisor to determine what, if anything, will fit your situation.
Be sure to check back in here periodically, as we’ll continue updating this list to give you the complete guide to investing in real estate – in 2017 and beyond.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
