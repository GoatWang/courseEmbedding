History[edit]
Rayonier was founded in 1926 as the Rainier Pulp and Paper Company in Shelton, Washington, with an office in San Francisco, California. Its name was inspired by Mount Rainier in Washington state. Its first mill opened the next year in Shelton and Port Angeles, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The mill used Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) trees to create a premium bleached paper pulp. In 1931, Rainier Pulp and Paper began working with the DuPont chemical company to produce hemlock pulp for the manufacture of rayon. Two additional pulp mills were constructed and began operation in the state of Washington.
Rainier Pulp and Paper changed its name to Rayonier, a portmanteau of the words rayon and Rainier, in 1937, when it became a publicly traded company. The following year, the company acquired timber stands in the southeastern United States and began construction of a Fernandina Beach, Florida, pulp mill, which began production in 1939.
In 1944, the company moved its offices to New York City. As World War II ended, Rayonier began making large land purchases in the Pacific Northwest. The Rayonier Foundation was created in 1952 to provide assistance to charitable, civic and education organizations in the communities where Rayonier did business.[citation needed]
Rayonier opened international sales offices in Europe and Asia during 1954. That same year, another pulp mill in the southeast was constructed at Jesup, Georgia. High demand prompted the facility to double its capacity by 1957.[citation needed]
ITT purchased the company in 1968 and the name changed to ITT Rayonier.
The Jesup mill grew larger in 1974, becoming the largest pulp mill on earth.
Company headquarters were moved again in 1978; this time to Stamford, Connecticut.
Diplomatic relations with China were restored in 1979. The following year, Rayonier received orders for pulp and logs. It took almost five years to receive permission to open an office in Beijing in 1985.
A log-trading office was opened in New Zealand during 1988. The New Zealand government sold Rayonier 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) of timberland in 1992.
The company was spun off from ITT in 1994 with the company name reverting to Rayonier and shares again traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Rayonier purchased 969,000 acres (3,920 km2) of timberland in Florida, Georgia and Alabama in 1999, then relocated the corporate offices to Jacksonville, Florida, to be closer to company employees and properties.[5]
Rayonier converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) on January 1, 2004.[6] TerraPointe LLC was established in 2005 to manage properties with development potential.
The 2006 purchase of 228,000 acres (920 km2) in six states brought the company's total of land owned, leased or managed to 2,600,000 acres (11,000 km2) in the U.S. and New Zealand.
In March 2008, the company purchased 56,300 acres (228 km2) for $215 million in southwest Washington state from Sierra Pacific [7]
In March 2013, the company sold its wood products division, including its mills in Baxley, Swainsboro, and Eatonton, Georgia, to British Columbia-based International Forest Products (Interfor) for $80 million.[8]
In April 2013, the company increased its shareholding in the joint venture Matariki Forestry Group in New Zealand from 26% to 65% for $140 million.[3]
In May 2014, Rayonier named David L. Nunes as post-separation president and CEO for Rayonier.[9]
A class action against members of the former management team by certain shareholders was launched for the period from October 26, 2010, to November 7, 2014, claiming over-harvesting while communicating publicly harvesting below a sustainable rate.[10]
In June 2014, Rayonier spun off its performance fibers business into an independent, publicly traded company, Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM).[11][12] Shareholders of Rayonier received one share of the new Rayonier Advanced Materials company for every three shares of Rayonier on June 27, 2014.[1][13]
In August 2015, Rayonier announced its ownership in the New Zealand joint venture will increase from 65% to approximately 77%, as part of an anticipated recapitalization of the JV.[14]
In May 2016, Rayonier announced upgrades to it Pacific Northwest timberland portfolio through the acquisition of 61,000 acres of timberlands in western Oregon for $263 million, and a disposition of 55,000 acres comprising predominantly pre-merchantable timber in Washington state for $130 million. The transactions significantly enhance Rayonier's Pacific Northwest portfolio by smoothing the age-class distribution, increasing merchantable timber inventory and increasing both long-term and near-term harvest potential.[15]

Rayonier Inc, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, is a timberland real estate investment trust ("REIT") with assets located in some of the most productive softwood timber growing regions in the United States and New Zealand. Its core business segments are timber and real estate. As of September 30, 2016, the company owned or leased approximately 2.3 million acres of timberlands located in the U.S. South (1.9 million acres) and U.S. Pacific Northwest (379,000 acres). The company also has a 77% ownership interest in Matariki Forestry Group, a joint venture, that owns or leases approximately 436,000 acres (299,000 net plantable acres) of timberlands in New Zealand.[4]

History[edit]
Rayonier was founded in 1926 as the Rainier Pulp and Paper Company in Shelton, Washington, with an office in San Francisco, California. Its name was inspired by Mount Rainier in Washington state. Its first mill opened the next year in Shelton and Port Angeles, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The mill used Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) trees to create a premium bleached paper pulp. In 1931, Rainier Pulp and Paper began working with the DuPont chemical company to produce hemlock pulp for the manufacture of rayon. Two additional pulp mills were constructed and began operation in the state of Washington.
Rainier Pulp and Paper changed its name to Rayonier, a portmanteau of the words rayon and Rainier, in 1937, when it became a publicly traded company. The following year, the company acquired timber stands in the southeastern United States and began construction of a Fernandina Beach, Florida, pulp mill, which began production in 1939.
In 1944, the company moved its offices to New York City. As World War II ended, Rayonier began making large land purchases in the Pacific Northwest. The Rayonier Foundation was created in 1952 to provide assistance to charitable, civic and education organizations in the communities where Rayonier did business.[citation needed]
Rayonier opened international sales offices in Europe and Asia during 1954. That same year, another pulp mill in the southeast was constructed at Jesup, Georgia. High demand prompted the facility to double its capacity by 1957.[citation needed]
ITT purchased the company in 1968 and the name changed to ITT Rayonier.
The Jesup mill grew larger in 1974, becoming the largest pulp mill on earth.
Company headquarters were moved again in 1978; this time to Stamford, Connecticut.
Diplomatic relations with China were restored in 1979. The following year, Rayonier received orders for pulp and logs. It took almost five years to receive permission to open an office in Beijing in 1985.
A log-trading office was opened in New Zealand during 1988. The New Zealand government sold Rayonier 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) of timberland in 1992.
The company was spun off from ITT in 1994 with the company name reverting to Rayonier and shares again traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Rayonier purchased 969,000 acres (3,920 km2) of timberland in Florida, Georgia and Alabama in 1999, then relocated the corporate offices to Jacksonville, Florida, to be closer to company employees and properties.[5]
Rayonier converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) on January 1, 2004.[6] TerraPointe LLC was established in 2005 to manage properties with development potential.
The 2006 purchase of 228,000 acres (920 km2) in six states brought the company's total of land owned, leased or managed to 2,600,000 acres (11,000 km2) in the U.S. and New Zealand.
In March 2008, the company purchased 56,300 acres (228 km2) for $215 million in southwest Washington state from Sierra Pacific [7]
In March 2013, the company sold its wood products division, including its mills in Baxley, Swainsboro, and Eatonton, Georgia, to British Columbia-based International Forest Products (Interfor) for $80 million.[8]
In April 2013, the company increased its shareholding in the joint venture Matariki Forestry Group in New Zealand from 26% to 65% for $140 million.[3]
In May 2014, Rayonier named David L. Nunes as post-separation president and CEO for Rayonier.[9]
A class action against members of the former management team by certain shareholders was launched for the period from October 26, 2010, to November 7, 2014, claiming over-harvesting while communicating publicly harvesting below a sustainable rate.[10]
In June 2014, Rayonier spun off its performance fibers business into an independent, publicly traded company, Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM).[11][12] Shareholders of Rayonier received one share of the new Rayonier Advanced Materials company for every three shares of Rayonier on June 27, 2014.[1][13]
In August 2015, Rayonier announced its ownership in the New Zealand joint venture will increase from 65% to approximately 77%, as part of an anticipated recapitalization of the JV.[14]
In May 2016, Rayonier announced upgrades to it Pacific Northwest timberland portfolio through the acquisition of 61,000 acres of timberlands in western Oregon for $263 million, and a disposition of 55,000 acres comprising predominantly pre-merchantable timber in Washington state for $130 million. The transactions significantly enhance Rayonier's Pacific Northwest portfolio by smoothing the age-class distribution, increasing merchantable timber inventory and increasing both long-term and near-term harvest potential.[15]
Business segments[edit]

Timber (48% of total sales for 2016)
U.S. real estate (38% of total sales for 2016)
Trading (14% of total sales for 2016).[2]

Forest Resources   Land Management   Research   Regeneration   FAQReal EstateHunting and Recreation










 

As one of the largest private landowners in the U.S., we create value by maximizing the yields of our timberlands through research and silviculture.




 

  			Our strategy is to increase our timberland holdings while upgrading the quality by evaluating every acre, divesting nonstrategic timberlands and re-investing in strategic timberlands.
  
Our 2.7 million acres of working forests, located in eleven U.S. states - focused in the U.S. South and U.S. Pacific Northwest - and New Zealand, provide wood for use in a variety of markets, from pulp to lumber, paper, oriented strand board (OSB) and other wood-based products. 

Rayonier is committed to the responsible management of every acre. In the U.S., we voluntarily subscribe to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® program, which includes independent third-party audits of our practices. In New Zealand, all our forests are 100% certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, a not-for-profit organization that promotes responsible management of the world's forests.





 

  			 
		



 

  			 
		




Across our research facilities, nurseries and 2.7 million acres in the U.S. and New Zealand, we’re always improving how we grow trees. The goal is stronger, healthier trees and sustainable use of the land.

Rayonier Inc, headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, is a timberland real estate investment trust ("REIT") with assets located in some of the most productive softwood timber growing regions in the United States and New Zealand. Its core business segments are timber and real estate. As of September 30, 2016, the company owned or leased approximately 2.3 million acres of timberlands located in the U.S. South (1.9 million acres) and U.S. Pacific Northwest (379,000 acres). The company also has a 77% ownership interest in Matariki Forestry Group, a joint venture, that owns or leases approximately 436,000 acres (299,000 net plantable acres) of timberlands in New Zealand.[4]

History[edit]
Rayonier was founded in 1926 as the Rainier Pulp and Paper Company in Shelton, Washington, with an office in San Francisco, California. Its name was inspired by Mount Rainier in Washington state. Its first mill opened the next year in Shelton and Port Angeles, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The mill used Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) trees to create a premium bleached paper pulp. In 1931, Rainier Pulp and Paper began working with the DuPont chemical company to produce hemlock pulp for the manufacture of rayon. Two additional pulp mills were constructed and began operation in the state of Washington.
Rainier Pulp and Paper changed its name to Rayonier, a portmanteau of the words rayon and Rainier, in 1937, when it became a publicly traded company. The following year, the company acquired timber stands in the southeastern United States and began construction of a Fernandina Beach, Florida, pulp mill, which began production in 1939.
In 1944, the company moved its offices to New York City. As World War II ended, Rayonier began making large land purchases in the Pacific Northwest. The Rayonier Foundation was created in 1952 to provide assistance to charitable, civic and education organizations in the communities where Rayonier did business.[citation needed]
Rayonier opened international sales offices in Europe and Asia during 1954. That same year, another pulp mill in the southeast was constructed at Jesup, Georgia. High demand prompted the facility to double its capacity by 1957.[citation needed]
ITT purchased the company in 1968 and the name changed to ITT Rayonier.
The Jesup mill grew larger in 1974, becoming the largest pulp mill on earth.
Company headquarters were moved again in 1978; this time to Stamford, Connecticut.
Diplomatic relations with China were restored in 1979. The following year, Rayonier received orders for pulp and logs. It took almost five years to receive permission to open an office in Beijing in 1985.
A log-trading office was opened in New Zealand during 1988. The New Zealand government sold Rayonier 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) of timberland in 1992.
The company was spun off from ITT in 1994 with the company name reverting to Rayonier and shares again traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Rayonier purchased 969,000 acres (3,920 km2) of timberland in Florida, Georgia and Alabama in 1999, then relocated the corporate offices to Jacksonville, Florida, to be closer to company employees and properties.[5]
Rayonier converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) on January 1, 2004.[6] TerraPointe LLC was established in 2005 to manage properties with development potential.
The 2006 purchase of 228,000 acres (920 km2) in six states brought the company's total of land owned, leased or managed to 2,600,000 acres (11,000 km2) in the U.S. and New Zealand.
In March 2008, the company purchased 56,300 acres (228 km2) for $215 million in southwest Washington state from Sierra Pacific [7]
In March 2013, the company sold its wood products division, including its mills in Baxley, Swainsboro, and Eatonton, Georgia, to British Columbia-based International Forest Products (Interfor) for $80 million.[8]
In April 2013, the company increased its shareholding in the joint venture Matariki Forestry Group in New Zealand from 26% to 65% for $140 million.[3]
In May 2014, Rayonier named David L. Nunes as post-separation president and CEO for Rayonier.[9]
A class action against members of the former management team by certain shareholders was launched for the period from October 26, 2010, to November 7, 2014, claiming over-harvesting while communicating publicly harvesting below a sustainable rate.[10]
In June 2014, Rayonier spun off its performance fibers business into an independent, publicly traded company, Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM).[11][12] Shareholders of Rayonier received one share of the new Rayonier Advanced Materials company for every three shares of Rayonier on June 27, 2014.[1][13]
In August 2015, Rayonier announced its ownership in the New Zealand joint venture will increase from 65% to approximately 77%, as part of an anticipated recapitalization of the JV.[14]
In May 2016, Rayonier announced upgrades to it Pacific Northwest timberland portfolio through the acquisition of 61,000 acres of timberlands in western Oregon for $263 million, and a disposition of 55,000 acres comprising predominantly pre-merchantable timber in Washington state for $130 million. The transactions significantly enhance Rayonier's Pacific Northwest portfolio by smoothing the age-class distribution, increasing merchantable timber inventory and increasing both long-term and near-term harvest potential.[15]

Its core business segments are timber and real estate. As of September 30, 2016, the company owned or leased approximately 2.3 million acres of timberlands located in the U.S. South (1.9 million acres) and U.S. Pacific Northwest (379,000 acres). The company also has a 77% ownership interest in Matariki Forestry Group, a joint venture, that owns or leases approximately 436,000 acres (299,000 net plantable acres) of timberlands in New Zealand.[4]

History[edit]
Rayonier was founded in 1926 as the Rainier Pulp and Paper Company in Shelton, Washington, with an office in San Francisco, California. Its name was inspired by Mount Rainier in Washington state. Its first mill opened the next year in Shelton and Port Angeles, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula. The mill used Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock) trees to create a premium bleached paper pulp. In 1931, Rainier Pulp and Paper began working with the DuPont chemical company to produce hemlock pulp for the manufacture of rayon. Two additional pulp mills were constructed and began operation in the state of Washington.
Rainier Pulp and Paper changed its name to Rayonier, a portmanteau of the words rayon and Rainier, in 1937, when it became a publicly traded company. The following year, the company acquired timber stands in the southeastern United States and began construction of a Fernandina Beach, Florida, pulp mill, which began production in 1939.
In 1944, the company moved its offices to New York City. As World War II ended, Rayonier began making large land purchases in the Pacific Northwest. The Rayonier Foundation was created in 1952 to provide assistance to charitable, civic and education organizations in the communities where Rayonier did business.[citation needed]
Rayonier opened international sales offices in Europe and Asia during 1954. That same year, another pulp mill in the southeast was constructed at Jesup, Georgia. High demand prompted the facility to double its capacity by 1957.[citation needed]
ITT purchased the company in 1968 and the name changed to ITT Rayonier.
The Jesup mill grew larger in 1974, becoming the largest pulp mill on earth.
Company headquarters were moved again in 1978; this time to Stamford, Connecticut.
Diplomatic relations with China were restored in 1979. The following year, Rayonier received orders for pulp and logs. It took almost five years to receive permission to open an office in Beijing in 1985.
A log-trading office was opened in New Zealand during 1988. The New Zealand government sold Rayonier 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) of timberland in 1992.
The company was spun off from ITT in 1994 with the company name reverting to Rayonier and shares again traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Rayonier purchased 969,000 acres (3,920 km2) of timberland in Florida, Georgia and Alabama in 1999, then relocated the corporate offices to Jacksonville, Florida, to be closer to company employees and properties.[5]
Rayonier converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) on January 1, 2004.[6] TerraPointe LLC was established in 2005 to manage properties with development potential.
The 2006 purchase of 228,000 acres (920 km2) in six states brought the company's total of land owned, leased or managed to 2,600,000 acres (11,000 km2) in the U.S. and New Zealand.
In March 2008, the company purchased 56,300 acres (228 km2) for $215 million in southwest Washington state from Sierra Pacific [7]
In March 2013, the company sold its wood products division, including its mills in Baxley, Swainsboro, and Eatonton, Georgia, to British Columbia-based International Forest Products (Interfor) for $80 million.[8]
In April 2013, the company increased its shareholding in the joint venture Matariki Forestry Group in New Zealand from 26% to 65% for $140 million.[3]
In May 2014, Rayonier named David L. Nunes as post-separation president and CEO for Rayonier.[9]
A class action against members of the former management team by certain shareholders was launched for the period from October 26, 2010, to November 7, 2014, claiming over-harvesting while communicating publicly harvesting below a sustainable rate.[10]
In June 2014, Rayonier spun off its performance fibers business into an independent, publicly traded company, Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. (NYSE: RYAM).[11][12] Shareholders of Rayonier received one share of the new Rayonier Advanced Materials company for every three shares of Rayonier on June 27, 2014.[1][13]
In August 2015, Rayonier announced its ownership in the New Zealand joint venture will increase from 65% to approximately 77%, as part of an anticipated recapitalization of the JV.[14]
In May 2016, Rayonier announced upgrades to it Pacific Northwest timberland portfolio through the acquisition of 61,000 acres of timberlands in western Oregon for $263 million, and a disposition of 55,000 acres comprising predominantly pre-merchantable timber in Washington state for $130 million. The transactions significantly enhance Rayonier's Pacific Northwest portfolio by smoothing the age-class distribution, increasing merchantable timber inventory and increasing both long-term and near-term harvest potential.[15]

Potlatch downgraded after disappointing timber tariff news, valuation concerns
Shares of Potlatch Corp.  dropped 1.7% in morning trade Tuesday, after the real estate investment trust which owns timberlands was downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation in the wake of underwhelming regulatory announcement regarding tariffs on Canadian lumber. Analyst Colin Mings cut his rating to market perform from outperform and removed his stock price target. The stock closed Monday at a four-year high of $48.20, above Mings' previous price target of $48. Late Monday, the Commerce Department announced it was considering additional fees on Canadian lumber imports that would mean some products could face duties as high as 30.88%. The announcement comes two months after the Trump administration moved to impose a 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Mings said that while protectionist trade policies are a positive for the timber REIT sector, the preliminary duty rates were within expectations. "However, there was no upside surprise in yesterday's announcement relative to our forecast, and we believe the preliminary finding will underwhelm some investors expecting a more aggressive stance on the issue," Mings wrote in a note to clients. July lumber futures  tumbled 1.8%. Among other timber REITs, shares of CatchMark Timber Trust Inc.  slipped 0.3%, Deltic Timber Corp.  lost 0.7% and Rayonier Inc.  edged up 0.1%. Potlatch's stock has climbed 14% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Potlatch downgraded after disappointing timber tariff news, valuation concerns
Shares of Potlatch Corp.  dropped 1.7% in morning trade Tuesday, after the real estate investment trust which owns timberlands was downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation in the wake of underwhelming regulatory announcement regarding tariffs on Canadian lumber. Analyst Colin Mings cut his rating to market perform from outperform and removed his stock price target. The stock closed Monday at a four-year high of $48.20, above Mings' previous price target of $48. Late Monday, the Commerce Department announced it was considering additional fees on Canadian lumber imports that would mean some products could face duties as high as 30.88%. The announcement comes two months after the Trump administration moved to impose a 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Mings said that while protectionist trade policies are a positive for the timber REIT sector, the preliminary duty rates were within expectations. "However, there was no upside surprise in yesterday's announcement relative to our forecast, and we believe the preliminary finding will underwhelm some investors expecting a more aggressive stance on the issue," Mings wrote in a note to clients. July lumber futures  tumbled 1.8%. Among other timber REITs, shares of CatchMark Timber Trust Inc.  slipped 0.3%, Deltic Timber Corp.  lost 0.7% and Rayonier Inc.  edged up 0.1%. Potlatch's stock has climbed 14% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

OverviewVision, Mission and ValuesCompany History










 

Organized as a Real Estate Investment Trust, Rayonier creates value for shareholders through solid cash flows that fund our dividend, and through the increasing value of our core businesses - Forest Resources and Real Estate. 




 

  			Much of our value resides in our 2.7 million acres of timberland – a renewable resource that generates cash flow and historically has appreciated faster than inflation. Our knowledge of land and how to maximize its return carries over to our Real Estate business as demographics and population growth increase property values above those of timberlands.

 




Forest Resources 
            As one of the largest private landowners in the U.S., we own, lease or manage approximately 2.7 million acres of highly-productive timberlands in the U.S. and New Zealand to supply timber to a wide variety of markets including pulp, paper, lumber, renewable energy production and other wood products.


 
 



Real Estate 
            At Rayonier, we evaluate each acre of our timberland to determine its greatest potential and highest and best use. In some cases, land that was once best suited for growing timber is now more valuable for residential, industrial, commercial or conservation use. Our real estate subsidiary provides added value by entitling or selling these properties.




REIT Structure
Rayonier is structured as a real estate investment trust and our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RYN. 

Careers 
Our strong track record of execution creates value for our shareholders and positions Rayonier as a strong, stable employer. There are more than 300 employees in the Rayonier family, each sharing our passion to create value in all we do.

Rayonier - Breaking Up Is Hard to Do

After 15 Years, Rayonier About to Split in Two - On or about June 30th, Rayonier will spin off its specialty dissolving pulp operations into a new company, called Rayonier Advanced Materials. Several years after Rayonier was spun out of the old ITT (International Telephone and Telegraph) in 1994, the company actively explored spinning off its specialty pulp business but decided, in the midst of the late-1990's tech bubble, that the market would not be attentive to a small timber company and a small pulp producer. (In fact, in 1999, one timber IPO we worked on at Salomon Smith Barney, Strategic Timber Trust, failed miserably.) This decision to hold off proved fortuitous, as RYN was able to support a high and rising dividend over the intervening years as the specialty dissolving pulp business (and, through the REIT conversion, the favorable tax laws) carried the company. With log markets likely near a bottom and development real estate (in northern FL and southeastern GA) soon to take off, the split "should work." There will be challenges: if log prices and demand do not continue to recover, the "remainco" (Rayonier) may have to depend on land sales (a la Plum Creek in recent years) to fund its planned ~4% dividend yield. Management hopes the specialty dissolving pulp business will be viewed as a specialty chemical play - which we see as unlikely in coming quarters given overcapacity and weak pricing.
Raising Our Target $1 to $45 On Timber/Land Recovery - In January, soon after the upcoming spinoff of the Performance Fibers (specialty dissolving pulp) business was announced, we increased our one-year target on RYN by $2 to $44. Our view then was to value the PF business at around $16/share based on a 5% discount to the Dow Jones Specialty Chemicals Index and the assumption of $1 billion of debt, with the "remainco" timberland and real estate (what will be Rayonier) valued at $28. At this time, we are tempering our view of the Performance Fibers (to be called "Rayonier Advanced Materials") valuation by $1 to $15, while upping our view of the "remainco" by $2 to $30 based on the improved outlook for its development lands and improvements in its key timber markets. With RYN closing on Friday at exactly our $45 target, we maintain our Hold rating.
The 30% "Closet" Dividend Cut - Let's be clear: one result of the Rayonier Advanced Materials ("RAM") spinoff will be the nearly 30% dividend cut. Rayonier had increased its payout steadily in recent years to the current $1.96/share rate. After the spin-off of Rayonier Advanced Materials, we see the combined dividend rate at around $1.40, an effective reduction of nearly 30%. Basically, management has indicated that it sees a dividend yield of 1.0%-1.5% on the RAM business - which on a $15 stock would be around $0.05 per quarter or $0.20 annually. It also sees a "competitive yield" on the remaining timber REIT company. When looking at the other 3 major publicly-traded timber REITs (and "rounding up"), we see about a 4% yield. If our $30 post-spin valuation of RYN is correct, the dividend should be around $0.30 per quarter, or $1.20 annually.
Raising EPS Estimates a Nickel - We are increasing our EPS estimates for Rayonier by 5 cents for 2014, 2015 and 2016. As a result of our move, our 2014 estimate moves to $1.90, our 2015 number goes to $2.15 and our 2016 estimate rises to $2.50. Of course, in the next several weeks we will be publishing separate estimates for both the post-spin RYN as well as the new RAM. Our best guess is that when-issued trading may begin in mid-June. Our higher estimates mainly reflect expected higher timberland income.


First Quarter Hints of Timberland Recovery
Rayonier reported operating EPS of $0.36 in the first quarter of 2014, missing significantly both our $0.48 estimate and the $0.46 consensus. However, the company actually operated well, with the shortfall owing to an unusually-low level of land sales (that will reverse in coming quarters). The table below shows how RYN performed in the first quarter relative to our expectations on a line-by-line basis:

Stock View
With Rayonier recently trading near our $45 one-year target price, we recommend investors hold Rayonier shares, especially given its attractive (prospective combined) 3.1% dividend yield (based on a $0.20 dividend at RAM and $1.20 at RYN as described above). The company's risk profile has increased given the substantial increase in RYN's specialty dissolving pulp ("Performance Fibers") capacity and given the guide down in pricing expectations in this business. (Specifically, RYN sees more competitive conditions in its high-end specialty dissolving pulp markets which will cause average prices to drop 7%-8% in 2014 versus 2013.) We believe the company's increased risk profile and the lower guidance for 2014 is about fairly reflected in RYN's recent $45 share price. Given our $45 target and the stock's 3.1% (prospective combined) yield, we would Hold the shares. At $52 or above, we would Sell. On the other hand, if the stock were to fall to $40 or below, we would consider once again upgrading the shares to Buy as the indicated total return would exceed 15% or higher.
Valuation
We developed our $45 target price for shares of RYN using the average of 2 methods: 1.) Break Up Value (discounted by 15% on an enterprise value basis to reflect status as a publicly-traded company), and 2.) DCF.
Break Up Value
We developed our $49 target price for RYN based on a discount to private market value. RYN owned (or held under decades-long leases) approximately 2.265 million acres of timberlands in the US at the end of 2013 which, on a blended basis, are worth approximately $2,233 per acre, or a total of $5.406 billion. Adding in the $3.089 billion estimated value of the Performance Fibers ("RAM") business, the $157 million in net working capital, and the $259 million NZ joint venture value yields a total private market value of $8.905 billion. Applying a 13% discount to this $8.905 billion private market value leads to a public enterprise value of $7.747 billion. We believe a 13% enterprise value discount adequately reflects RYN's (after the PF business' spin) standing as a public company plus the uncertainty surrounding liquidity for future timberland transactions and their valuations in RYN's regions. Backing out $1.352 billion in net debt and $94 million in pension and other retirement liabilities, we derive a public equity value of $6.301 billion. Dividing this $6.301 billion by the 128 million diluted shares outstanding, we derive a $49 target price.

Discounted Cash Flows
We then calculate a $41 target pricing using our DCF model, which assumes a 3.0% risk free rate (based on the 10-year US Treasury Bond), and applies a 6.2% WACC, and a 13.5x terminal multiple to our forecasted cash flows.
Averaging the results of calculating a price target using these two methods, we arrive at our $45 one-year target price.
Risks
Risks to our $45 target price on RYN being exceeded are that timberland values increase in coming years, versus our expectations of flat-to-down values (as longer-term interest rates rise); demand for wood products (and thus timber) recovers significantly faster than we expect; or the dollar weakens significantly versus other currencies improving the cost advantage of US timber. In addition, should specialty dissolving and fluff pulp demand (and thus prices) rise faster than we are anticipating, shares of RYN may perform better than we are anticipating. In addition a substantial and prolonged jump in fossil-fuel prices could make wood-based alternative fuels more attractive, thus bolstering company earnings and perceived timberland values. On the other hand, risks to our target price not being reached or maintained are: timberland values decline more than we currently anticipate; demand for wood products (and thus timber) recovers significantly less than we expect; and the dollar strengthens significantly versus other currencies hurting the cost advantage of US timber-based products. In addition, should specialty dissolving pulp demand, and thus prices not decline faster, or rise slower, than we are anticipating over time, shares of RYN (and the to-be-spun-off Rayonier Advanced Materials business) may not perform as well as we are reflecting in our one-year target.
