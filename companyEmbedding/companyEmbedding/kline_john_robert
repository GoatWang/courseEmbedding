UNIVERSITY HISTORY
   Pioneer African American Mathematicians
 

Introduction
In 1882 the University of Pennsylvania established its 
Ph.D. program in arts and sciences and ten years later awarded its first doctorate 
in mathematics. The modern Department of Mathematics at Penn dates from 1899 when 
mathematics at Penn became fully distinguished from cognate disciplines. Like 
other departments in the Graduate School, Mathematics admitted women and people 
of color from its inception. Roxana Hayward Vivian was the first woman to earn 
the Ph.D., taking her degree in 1901 and later becoming Professor of Mathematics 
and Astronomy at Wellesley College. In the years before 1927 four women earned 
the Ph.D. in Mathematics at Penn. 
In 1896 Lewis Baxter Moore was the first 
African American to earn a Ph.D. at Penn, taking his degree in Classics. Other 
talented African Americans had preceded him in earning degrees in the College 
and in Penn's several professional schools. Their contributions to University 
history were celebrated in A Century of Black Presence, an exhibition opened in 
1980 and still on display in the lobby of the DuBois College House. Penn's first 
African American Ph.D.s in mathematics, however, did not enjoy public recognition 
until this exhibition was organized in 1998.
 
Dudley Weldon Woodard: 
When Dudley Weldon Woodard (1881-1965) enrolled in the Graduate School 
at Penn in 1927, he had already accumulated a remarkable set of achievements. 
He had published his University of Chicago master's thesis in mathematics, "Loci 
Connected with the Problem of Two Bodies" and had been teaching mathematics at 
the collegiate level for two decades. He had been a member of the faculty for 
seven years at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama; for six years at Wilberforce 
University in Ohio; and since 1920, at Howard University, then the most prestigious 
African American university in the country. At Howard, he also held the post of 
Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.
 Though he excelled and was hugely 
popular as an academic administrator, Woodard was also an intellectual. In the 
early 1920s he began taking advanced mathematics courses in the summer sessions 
at Columbia University. It then became clear that he was among the gifted mathematicians 
in the nation. Columbia's loss was Penn's gain when in 1927 Woodard took scholarly 
leave from Howard and spent a year at Penn, working under the direction of John 
R. Kline, one of the best and brightest of Penn's mathematics faculty. On Wednesday, 
28 June 1928, Woodard became the 38th person to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics 
from Penn. More significantly, Woodard was only the second African American in 
the nation to receive that degree. 
Dr. Woodard returned to Howard, where 
his career flourished. He established the graduate program in mathematics, obtained 
the necessary resources and administrative support for a mathematics library, 
and sponsored visiting professorships and scholarly seminars. When he retired 
in 1947 as chairman of the department, he had led Howard's mathematics faculty 
through a quarter century of steady advancement. In an age of discrimination, 
Dudley Weldon Woodard had competed and triumphed in the face of overwhelming odds. 
Penn is proud to claim him among its most distinguished alumni. 
 
William Waldron Schieffelin Claytor:
In 1929-30 William Waldron Schieffelin Claytor 
(1908-1967) was the most promising student in the inaugural year of Professor 
Dudley Weldon Woodard's new graduate mathematics program at Howard University. 
Professor Woodard, fresh from earning his PhD at Penn, recommended Claytor for 
admission to Penn's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Woodard's teacher at 
Penn, Professor John R. Kline, agreed to advise Claytor. 
Claytor was a 
brilliant student. He enrolled at Penn in the 1930-31 academic year, won a Harrison 
Scholarship in Mathematics in his second year, and took the most prestigious award 
offered at Penn at that time, a Harrison Fellowship in Mathematics, in his third 
and final year of graduate studies. Claytor's dissertation delighted the Penn 
faculty, for it provided a significant advance in the theory of Peano continua 
- a branch of point-set topology in which Kline was an expert. On Wednesday, 21 
June 1933, Penn conferred its PhD on Claytor, who thereby became the third African 
American in the nation to earn the degree in mathematics. When Claytor published 
his dissertation, he had every reason to expect competing offers from America's 
leading research universities. But in that era of pervasive racial discrimination 
only a predominantly African American institution, West Virginia State College, 
welcomed him to its faculty.
In 1934, Dr. Claytor published 
his embedding theorem, which stated, "a Peano continuum K is homeomorphic to a 
subset of the surface of a sphere if and only if it contains neither a primitive 
skew curve nor a topological image of either of the Figures 7 or 8." (see illustration 
at the top of this page: Proceedings of the Eleventh Annual Meeting of the National 
Association of Mathematicians (1980). Photograph courtesy of the National Association 
of Mathematicians) The Polish mathematician Casmir Kuratowski had introduced Figures 
7 and 8, but Claytor advanced the theory and incorporated it into an effective 
whole. Professional mathematicians began to refer to these Figures as "Claytor 
curves."
John R. Kline continued to mentor Claytor and on his 
recommendation Claytor obtained a Rosenwald Fellowship in 1937. He spent a year 
at the University of Michigan, working with Professor R.L. Wilder and a group 
of talented topologists. Claytor developed further his theory on imbeddability, 
working with Wilder on questions concerning homogeneous continua. Despite the 
support of his colleagues, Michigan failed to offer him a faculty position. Friends 
intervened and opened the possibility of a position at the Institute for Advanced 
Study in Princeton. But something had changed within him and he declined the offer. 
After service in the United States Army during World War II, Claytor renewed his 
teaching, but ceased his research. In 1947, a year after Woodard's retirement, 
Claytor joined the Howard University faculty, where he remained until taking early 
retirement in 1965. William Claytor's best years may well have been those he spent 
in Philadelphia, but his unfulfilled promise was a great disappointment for John 
R. Kline and his generation of colleagues at Penn.

Remarks on the occasion of the opening of the exhibition:
"Pioneering African American Mathematicians"
16 February 1999 
I am Patricia Vickers, Manager of the University Records Center, and I am pleased 
to speak to you today on behalf of Rahsaan Maxwell, the curator of this exhibition, 
who is in Japan and Mark Lloyd, the director of the University Archives and Records 
Center, who is in New York City. 
The University Archives and Records Center 
extends its appreciation to Professor Dennis DeTurck for his invitation to join 
today's celebration and to the Department of Mathematics for the opportunity to 
partner in the celebration of its centennial. We also wish to thank Professor 
Jerry Porter, who conceived the Woodard / Claytor exhibition and whose determination 
played a large part in bringing it to fruition. Professor Bob Engs played a huge 
role in our success by recruiting Rahsaan Maxwell from the Department of History. 
And we are delighted that Professor Howard Stevenson, the Fellows, and Dean at 
DuBois College House will be providing the exhibition a permanent home in the 
DuBois College House Library. 
Prior to this exhibition, the extraordinary 
achievements of Dudley Woodard and William Claytor were virtually unknown at Penn. 
Eighteen years ago, also under the auspices of the University Archives, extensive 
research established the names and biographies of the first African American alumni 
at each of Penn's twelve schools. No corresponding effort, however, has expanded 
our knowledge to include the first African American graduates of the two dozen 
distinct academic disciplines in the School of Arts and Sciences. Perhaps this 
exhibition will serve to encourage such additional research; surely it answers 
any questions concerning the distinguished presence of African Americans in the 
history of Mathematics at Penn. 
The success of the research, writing, and 
illustration of the exhibition is largely due to the research strategy which Mark 
Lloyd and Rahsaan Maxwell developed early last summer. Utilizing published sources 
at Penn and through interlibrary loan, Rahsaan prepared for two visits to Howard 
University and one to Morgan State University, the institutions of higher education 
where Woodard and Claytor spent their professional careers. On site, in the District 
of Columbia and Baltimore, respectively, Rahsaan interviewed former colleagues 
of both men and obtained copies of primary source materials found in the university 
archives at both institutions. Over a period of six weeks he steadily assembled 
detailed and reliable biographical accounts.
 By early August he had prepared 
draft text and submitted it to the Mathematics faculty. Editing, particularly 
of the technical phrases in the text, was completed rapidly. The exhibit materials 
were soon placed in the hands of the fabricators, who installed them in the display 
case in early September. By the time it is removed next month for delivery to 
DuBois College House, the exhibit will have enjoyed a full six-month run here 
at the David Rittenhouse Laboratory. 
All of us at the University Archives 
hope that this tribute to African American accomplishment at Penn has helped -- 
and will continue to help -- the University be a better place to study and work 
than it otherwise would have been. We thank you for the opportunity to be here 
today.

case in early September. By the time it is removed next month for delivery to 
DuBois College House, the exhibit will have enjoyed a full six-month run here 
at the David Rittenhouse Laboratory. 
All of us at the University Archives 
hope that this tribute to African American accomplishment at Penn has helped -- 
and will continue to help -- the University be a better place to study and work 
than it otherwise would have been. We thank you for the opportunity to be here 
today.
