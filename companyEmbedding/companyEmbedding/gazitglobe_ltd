History[edit]
Gazit-Globe was founded in 1982. Since May 1991, the company has been controlled by Chaim Katzman, who trained as a lawyer and in 1979 moved to South Florida, where he became involved in the development and management of commercial and residential real estate. During the 1980s he also started developing his real estate business in Israel, and was able to consolidate his holding in Gazit-Globe, at the time a corporate shell with no business operations.[1]
The holding in Gazit-Globe enabled Katzman to draw investors to help him acquire additional retail centers, and it became a vehicle to raise capital for further property and business acquisitions.[1]
In 1992, Katzman formed Equity One as a partially owned subsidiary of Gazit that operate as a Real estate investment trust (REIT). Equity One grew gradually during the mid-1990s and in 1998 the company had an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, Gazit-Globe retained partial ownership of Equity One after the business was spun off as a stand-alone company. Going public provided Equity One with access to US capital markets and hastened its growth. Equity One won over investors seeking steady dividend income.[2]
In 2004 Gazit acquired 33% of Citycon, a Finnish public company which focuses on commercial real estate in the Nordic region. In the following years Gazit increased its stake in the company to 47%.[3]
In August 2008 Gazit-Globe finalised the takeover of the troubled European property developer Meinl European Land (MELV.VI.), Gazit together with Citigroup jointly invested 800 million euros in Meinl Land. The move strengthened Gazit's foothold in the Eastern European and Russian markets. Following the takeover, Meinl's name was changed to Atrium European Real Estate Limited and a new board of directors and management was appointed.[4]
In December 2011, Gazit-Globe had an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which raised USD $81.0 million in gross proceeds. Its stock is traded under the ticker symbol “GZT”.[5]
In October 2013, Gazit-Globe listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GZT" [6]

History[edit]
Gazit-Globe was founded in 1982. Since May 1991, the company has been controlled by Chaim Katzman, who trained as a lawyer and in 1979 moved to South Florida, where he became involved in the development and management of commercial and residential real estate. During the 1980s he also started developing his real estate business in Israel, and was able to consolidate his holding in Gazit-Globe, at the time a corporate shell with no business operations.[1]
The holding in Gazit-Globe enabled Katzman to draw investors to help him acquire additional retail centers, and it became a vehicle to raise capital for further property and business acquisitions.[1]
In 1992, Katzman formed Equity One as a partially owned subsidiary of Gazit that operate as a Real estate investment trust (REIT). Equity One grew gradually during the mid-1990s and in 1998 the company had an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, Gazit-Globe retained partial ownership of Equity One after the business was spun off as a stand-alone company. Going public provided Equity One with access to US capital markets and hastened its growth. Equity One won over investors seeking steady dividend income.[2]
In 2004 Gazit acquired 33% of Citycon, a Finnish public company which focuses on commercial real estate in the Nordic region. In the following years Gazit increased its stake in the company to 47%.[3]
In August 2008 Gazit-Globe finalised the takeover of the troubled European property developer Meinl European Land (MELV.VI.), Gazit together with Citigroup jointly invested 800 million euros in Meinl Land. The move strengthened Gazit's foothold in the Eastern European and Russian markets. Following the takeover, Meinl's name was changed to Atrium European Real Estate Limited and a new board of directors and management was appointed.[4]
In December 2011, Gazit-Globe had an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which raised USD $81.0 million in gross proceeds. Its stock is traded under the ticker symbol “GZT”.[5]
In October 2013, Gazit-Globe listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GZT" [6]

History[edit]
Gazit-Globe was founded in 1982. Since May 1991, the company has been controlled by Chaim Katzman, who trained as a lawyer and in 1979 moved to South Florida, where he became involved in the development and management of commercial and residential real estate. During the 1980s he also started developing his real estate business in Israel, and was able to consolidate his holding in Gazit-Globe, at the time a corporate shell with no business operations.[1]
The holding in Gazit-Globe enabled Katzman to draw investors to help him acquire additional retail centers, and it became a vehicle to raise capital for further property and business acquisitions.[1]
In 1992, Katzman formed Equity One as a partially owned subsidiary of Gazit that operate as a Real estate investment trust (REIT). Equity One grew gradually during the mid-1990s and in 1998 the company had an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, Gazit-Globe retained partial ownership of Equity One after the business was spun off as a stand-alone company. Going public provided Equity One with access to US capital markets and hastened its growth. Equity One won over investors seeking steady dividend income.[2]
In 2004 Gazit acquired 33% of Citycon, a Finnish public company which focuses on commercial real estate in the Nordic region. In the following years Gazit increased its stake in the company to 47%.[3]
In August 2008 Gazit-Globe finalised the takeover of the troubled European property developer Meinl European Land (MELV.VI.), Gazit together with Citigroup jointly invested 800 million euros in Meinl Land. The move strengthened Gazit's foothold in the Eastern European and Russian markets. Following the takeover, Meinl's name was changed to Atrium European Real Estate Limited and a new board of directors and management was appointed.[4]
In December 2011, Gazit-Globe had an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, which raised USD $81.0 million in gross proceeds. Its stock is traded under the ticker symbol “GZT”.[5]
In October 2013, Gazit-Globe listed its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GZT" [6]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
