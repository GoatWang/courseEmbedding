Daniel Jackson Evans (born October 16, 1925) served three terms as the 16th Governor of the state of Washington from 1965 to 1977, and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1983 to 1989.[1]
Evans was seriously considered for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 1968 and 1976. At the 1968 Republican National Convention (where he gave the keynote address) Evans refused to endorse Richard Nixon for the presidential nomination, remaining a supporter of the unsuccessful candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.[2]

Early life[edit]
Evans was born in Seattle, Washington (where he has lived as of 2007[update]),[1] descended from a family that had first arrived in the Washington Territory in 1859; his grandfather had served in one of Washington's first state senates. He grew up in the Laurelhurst neighborhood and attended Roosevelt High School.[3]
As a young man, Evans, an Eagle Scout,[4] and served as a staff member and Hike Master at Camp Parsons, a well known Boy Scout camp in Washington State. As an adult, he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.
After high school, he served in the United States Navy 1943–1946.[1] He first entered the V-12 Navy College Training Program and was stationed at the University of Washington (UW), but was transferred eight months later to an ROTC program at University of California, Berkeley. He did not see combat; he was deployed to the Pacific shortly after the end of World War II as a commissioned ensign on a succession of aircraft carriers, before returning to UW in 1946.[3]
Evans graduated from the University of Washington with degrees in civil engineering (BS, 1948, MS, 1949);[1][3] the UW later (in 2007) gave him the distinction of Alumnus Summa Laude Dignitatus, the highest distinction the university confers on its graduates.[3] He returned to the United States Navy (1951–1953)[1] before working as a structural engineer[1][3] (1953–1956); in the latter capacity, he helped draw up the plans for the Alaskan Way Viaduct.[3]
Political career[edit]
Having attended Toastmasters to improve his initially abysmal public speaking style,[2] Evans served in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1956 to 1965 before being elected governor.[1]




Senator Daniel J. Evans


Despite being a Republican and a self-styled conservative, Evans became known for his administration's liberal policies on environmental protection (he founded the country's first state-level Department of Ecology, which became Nixon's blueprint for the federal EPA) and strong support of the state's higher education system, including founding Washington's system of community colleges. He fought unsuccessfully for a state income tax.[4]
Evans served as governor from 1965 until 1977,[1] still the only governor to serve three four-year consecutive terms and the second to be elected to three terms after Arthur B. Langlie in Washington state history. A 1981 University of Michigan study named him one of the ten outstanding American governors of the 20th century.[4] He declined to run for a fourth term.[5] Serial killer Ted Bundy served as a campaign aide for Evans and maintained a close relationship with the Governor. During the 1972 campaign, Bundy followed Evans' Democratic opponent around the state, tape recording his speeches and reported back to Evans personally. A minor scandal later followed when the Democrats found out about Bundy, who had been posing as a college student.[citation needed]
From 1977 to 1983 Evans served as the second president of The Evergreen State College in Olympia,[1] which Evans had created in 1967 by signing a legislative act authorizing the formation of the college. The largest building on the Evergreen campus is named the Daniel J. Evans Library in his honor.[1] In 1983, Governor John Spellman appointed Evans to the United States Senate to fill a seat left vacant by the death of longtime senator Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson. Evans won a special election later that year against Mike Lowry and filled the remainder of Jackson's unexpired term, retiring from politics after the 1988 elections.[1][6] He was not happy as a U.S. Senator; he wrote an April 1988 piece in The New York Times Magazine, "Why I'm Quitting the Senate", in which he complained of "bickering and protracted paralysis".[4]
Later life[edit]
After leaving the Senate in 1989, Evans founded his own consulting firm, Daniel J. Evans Associates.[1] Governor Mike Lowry appointed him to the Board of Regents of the University of Washington in 1993; Evans served as the board's president from 1996 to 1997,[1] and in 1999 the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University was named for him. Evans also went on to work in media doing an editorial weekly on the KIRO-TV newscasts from the early to mid 1990s. Evans is a director of the Initiative for Global Development.[7]

Daniel Jackson Evans (born October 16, 1925) served three terms as the 16th Governor of the state of Washington from 1965 to 1977, and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1983 to 1989.[1]
Evans was seriously considered for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 1968 and 1976. At the 1968 Republican National Convention (where he gave the keynote address) Evans refused to endorse Richard Nixon for the presidential nomination, remaining a supporter of the unsuccessful candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.[2]

Early life[edit]
Evans was born in Seattle, Washington (where he has lived as of 2007[update]),[1] descended from a family that had first arrived in the Washington Territory in 1859; his grandfather had served in one of Washington's first state senates. He grew up in the Laurelhurst neighborhood and attended Roosevelt High School.[3]
As a young man, Evans, an Eagle Scout,[4] and served as a staff member and Hike Master at Camp Parsons, a well known Boy Scout camp in Washington State. As an adult, he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.
After high school, he served in the United States Navy 1943–1946.[1] He first entered the V-12 Navy College Training Program and was stationed at the University of Washington (UW), but was transferred eight months later to an ROTC program at University of California, Berkeley. He did not see combat; he was deployed to the Pacific shortly after the end of World War II as a commissioned ensign on a succession of aircraft carriers, before returning to UW in 1946.[3]
Evans graduated from the University of Washington with degrees in civil engineering (BS, 1948, MS, 1949);[1][3] the UW later (in 2007) gave him the distinction of Alumnus Summa Laude Dignitatus, the highest distinction the university confers on its graduates.[3] He returned to the United States Navy (1951–1953)[1] before working as a structural engineer[1][3] (1953–1956); in the latter capacity, he helped draw up the plans for the Alaskan Way Viaduct.[3]
Political career[edit]
Having attended Toastmasters to improve his initially abysmal public speaking style,[2] Evans served in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1956 to 1965 before being elected governor.[1]




Senator Daniel J. Evans


Despite being a Republican and a self-styled conservative, Evans became known for his administration's liberal policies on environmental protection (he founded the country's first state-level Department of Ecology, which became Nixon's blueprint for the federal EPA) and strong support of the state's higher education system, including founding Washington's system of community colleges. He fought unsuccessfully for a state income tax.[4]
Evans served as governor from 1965 until 1977,[1] still the only governor to serve three four-year consecutive terms and the second to be elected to three terms after Arthur B. Langlie in Washington state history. A 1981 University of Michigan study named him one of the ten outstanding American governors of the 20th century.[4] He declined to run for a fourth term.[5] Serial killer Ted Bundy served as a campaign aide for Evans and maintained a close relationship with the Governor. During the 1972 campaign, Bundy followed Evans' Democratic opponent around the state, tape recording his speeches and reported back to Evans personally. A minor scandal later followed when the Democrats found out about Bundy, who had been posing as a college student.[citation needed]
From 1977 to 1983 Evans served as the second president of The Evergreen State College in Olympia,[1] which Evans had created in 1967 by signing a legislative act authorizing the formation of the college. The largest building on the Evergreen campus is named the Daniel J. Evans Library in his honor.[1] In 1983, Governor John Spellman appointed Evans to the United States Senate to fill a seat left vacant by the death of longtime senator Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson. Evans won a special election later that year against Mike Lowry and filled the remainder of Jackson's unexpired term, retiring from politics after the 1988 elections.[1][6] He was not happy as a U.S. Senator; he wrote an April 1988 piece in The New York Times Magazine, "Why I'm Quitting the Senate", in which he complained of "bickering and protracted paralysis".[4]
Later life[edit]
After leaving the Senate in 1989, Evans founded his own consulting firm, Daniel J. Evans Associates.[1] Governor Mike Lowry appointed him to the Board of Regents of the University of Washington in 1993; Evans served as the board's president from 1996 to 1997,[1] and in 1999 the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University was named for him. Evans also went on to work in media doing an editorial weekly on the KIRO-TV newscasts from the early to mid 1990s. Evans is a director of the Initiative for Global Development.[7]

Daniel Jackson Evans (born October 16, 1925) served three terms as the 16th Governor of the state of Washington from 1965 to 1977, and represented the state in the United States Senate from 1983 to 1989.[1]
Evans was seriously considered for the Republican vice presidential nomination in 1968 and 1976. At the 1968 Republican National Convention (where he gave the keynote address) Evans refused to endorse Richard Nixon for the presidential nomination, remaining a supporter of the unsuccessful candidacy of Nelson Rockefeller.[2]

Early life[edit]
Evans was born in Seattle, Washington (where he has lived as of 2007[update]),[1] descended from a family that had first arrived in the Washington Territory in 1859; his grandfather had served in one of Washington's first state senates. He grew up in the Laurelhurst neighborhood and attended Roosevelt High School.[3]
As a young man, Evans, an Eagle Scout,[4] and served as a staff member and Hike Master at Camp Parsons, a well known Boy Scout camp in Washington State. As an adult, he was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.
After high school, he served in the United States Navy 1943–1946.[1] He first entered the V-12 Navy College Training Program and was stationed at the University of Washington (UW), but was transferred eight months later to an ROTC program at University of California, Berkeley. He did not see combat; he was deployed to the Pacific shortly after the end of World War II as a commissioned ensign on a succession of aircraft carriers, before returning to UW in 1946.[3]
Evans graduated from the University of Washington with degrees in civil engineering (BS, 1948, MS, 1949);[1][3] the UW later (in 2007) gave him the distinction of Alumnus Summa Laude Dignitatus, the highest distinction the university confers on its graduates.[3] He returned to the United States Navy (1951–1953)[1] before working as a structural engineer[1][3] (1953–1956); in the latter capacity, he helped draw up the plans for the Alaskan Way Viaduct.[3]
Political career[edit]
Having attended Toastmasters to improve his initially abysmal public speaking style,[2] Evans served in the Washington State House of Representatives from 1956 to 1965 before being elected governor.[1]




Senator Daniel J. Evans


Despite being a Republican and a self-styled conservative, Evans became known for his administration's liberal policies on environmental protection (he founded the country's first state-level Department of Ecology, which became Nixon's blueprint for the federal EPA) and strong support of the state's higher education system, including founding Washington's system of community colleges. He fought unsuccessfully for a state income tax.[4]
Evans served as governor from 1965 until 1977,[1] still the only governor to serve three four-year consecutive terms and the second to be elected to three terms after Arthur B. Langlie in Washington state history. A 1981 University of Michigan study named him one of the ten outstanding American governors of the 20th century.[4] He declined to run for a fourth term.[5] Serial killer Ted Bundy served as a campaign aide for Evans and maintained a close relationship with the Governor. During the 1972 campaign, Bundy followed Evans' Democratic opponent around the state, tape recording his speeches and reported back to Evans personally. A minor scandal later followed when the Democrats found out about Bundy, who had been posing as a college student.[citation needed]
From 1977 to 1983 Evans served as the second president of The Evergreen State College in Olympia,[1] which Evans had created in 1967 by signing a legislative act authorizing the formation of the college. The largest building on the Evergreen campus is named the Daniel J. Evans Library in his honor.[1] In 1983, Governor John Spellman appointed Evans to the United States Senate to fill a seat left vacant by the death of longtime senator Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson. Evans won a special election later that year against Mike Lowry and filled the remainder of Jackson's unexpired term, retiring from politics after the 1988 elections.[1][6] He was not happy as a U.S. Senator; he wrote an April 1988 piece in The New York Times Magazine, "Why I'm Quitting the Senate", in which he complained of "bickering and protracted paralysis".[4]
Later life[edit]
After leaving the Senate in 1989, Evans founded his own consulting firm, Daniel J. Evans Associates.[1] Governor Mike Lowry appointed him to the Board of Regents of the University of Washington in 1993; Evans served as the board's president from 1996 to 1997,[1] and in 1999 the Daniel J. Evans School of Public Affairs at the University was named for him. Evans also went on to work in media doing an editorial weekly on the KIRO-TV newscasts from the early to mid 1990s. Evans is a director of the Initiative for Global Development.[7]

University of Washington
Evans School of Public Policy & Governance 
















Daniel J. Evans 









 


Distinguished Practitioner-In-ResidenceDaniel J. Evans ranks as one of the most distinguished leaders in the history of the State of Washington. Perhaps best known as governor from 1965–1977, he has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service. He has longstanding ties to the University of Washington (UW) and exemplary experience in the fields of governance, education, and the environment.
Before entering politics, Evans was a civil engineer. After graduating from UW with degrees in civil engineering (BS ’48; MS ’49), he worked as a structural engineer for the City of Seattle, Associated General Contractors, and in private practice. In 1956, he entered politics as a member of the Washington State House of Representatives, where he served from 1956–1965.
He became governor of the State of Washington in 1965, ultimately serving an unprecedented three consecutive terms. He was recognized as “One of the Ten Outstanding Governors in the 20th Century” (University of Michigan study, 1981). After declining to run for office again, he assumed the presidency of Olympia's Evergreen State College in 1977. From 1981–1983, he also served as chairman of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council. After the death of Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson in 1983, Evans was appointed and then elected to the U.S. Senate. In 1989, he chose not to run for reelection.
Evans is actively involved in a large number of community and nonprofit organizations. He chaired the National Academy of Science's Commission on Policy Options for Global Warming and co-chaired a delegation to monitor elections in Nicaragua with former President Jimmy Carter. From 1989–1994, Evans also served as a political analyst for KIRO radio and TV. He taught as a part-time lecturer at the Evans School from March 1989–1990, and currently heads his own consulting firm, Daniel J. Evans Associates.
He has served on numerous corporate and civic boards, including Costco, Puget Sound Energy, and the Nature Conservancy. In 1993, he was appointed by Governor Mike Lowry to the Board of Regents for the University of Washington, where he has served as vice president (1995–1996), president (1996–1997), and chair of the Capital Assets Committee. His term on the Board of Regents ended in 2005.
Dan Evans and his wife Nancy have three grown sons, Dan Jr., Mark, and Bruce, and nine grandchildren.

Evans Products Company

Evans Products Company was one of the most successful wood products corporations in the United States in the twentieth century. Their largest, most innovative, and most important west coast plant was located at Coos Bay (Coos County), Oregon, from 1928 to 1962.
The company founder, Edward Steptoe Evans, was a self-made man who had worked as a printer, a store clerk, a cowhand, a librarian, and an author when finally, at age thirty-five, he developed a product that made him a fortune.  In 1915, he created the "Evans Block," a small wooden device that made loading and shipping automobiles by rail more efficient.  Evans's involvement in the car industry led him naturally to produce another product for the automobile: battery separators. Dozens of thin shields were needed to separate the numerous positive and negative plates inside storage batteries while allowing for the flow of the battery acids. Evans's research and development personnel found that Port Orford cedar was an ideal material for these separators. Evans opened a manufacturing plant on Coos Bay in 1928 near the convergence of the Coalbank and Isthmus Sloughs in order to be near the best stands of Port Orford cedar. At various times, Evans Products operations were also located in Gold Beach, Lebanon, Corvallis, Winchester, and Portland. With the onset of World War II, battery separators for military vehicles, tanks, and submarines were in high demand, and the Coos Bay plant produced over 500 million separators in 1942 alone. The heyday of operations was in the early 1950s when over 1,000 laborers with an annual payroll of over three million dollars found work at the Coos Bay plant.
Even during the Great Depression, Evans had hundreds of women workers in an industry that was traditionally male. Known as "Lumber Jinneys" (a spin-off of the familiar term "Lumber Jack"), these women predated the familiar "Rosie the Riveter" by at least a decade.
The Evans Company had a reputation for innovation and diversification. Besides battery separators, it produced railroad ties, fence posts, and broom sticks in the 1930s. It also was the leading producer of high quality Port Orford cedar Venetian blinds.
Upon his father's death in 1945, Edward S. Evans Jr. headed the company and continued with new product lines. In response to the need for post-war housing, the Evans Company manufactured lumber for pre-fabricated homes. Using 3500 feet of fir lumber for framing, wall panels, cupboards, and shelves, the company claimed it could complete an "Evans House" on a poured foundation in forty-eight hours.
By the 1950s, the company was an important producer of plywood. It developed wooden stadium seats that were installed in the newly constructed Marshfield High School gym, and made high quality wooden furniture. One author claims that the term "wood products" came into common use in the 1940s and 1950s as a result of the company's prominence.
The Evans Products Company plant closed its doors in Coos Bay in the spring of 1962. Newspaper editorials at the time speculated the closure was due to the growing scarcity of Port Orford cedar, increased foreign competition, and the creation of other materials that replaced traditional wood products. After a failed attempt to restart the business, the city of Coos Bay burned the old Evans buildings in 1965. A section of Highway 101 near the old plant site was designated Evans Boulevard, one of the few reminders of this once important Coos Bay business.

Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Personal Injury Lawyers: A personal injury lawyer is a lawyer who provides legal representation to those who claim to have been injured, physically or psychologically, as a result of the negligence or wrongdoing of another person, company, government agency, or other entity. Personal injury lawyers tend to practice primarily the area of law known as tort law. Even though personal injury lawyers are trained and licensed to practice virtually any field of law, they generally only handle cases that fall under tort law including work injuries, automobile and other accidents, defective products, medical mistakes, and slip and fall accidents.

California Variable Annuity Attorney: Kickbacks


ATTORNEY NEWSLETTER
Commissions and Kickbacks in the Annuity Market
An oft-quoted truism in the financial industry is that some products are “sold, not bought.”  This is especially true of annuities, a type of product that often seems to provide more of a benefit to the ¬¬company than to the consumer.  In recent years, the annuity has changed from a rock-solid financial product that promised guaranteed returns based on treasury bonds, into a host of diverse, complex, and fee-laden products that promise market rate returns with “no risk,” a red flag for investors.  Since few retirees looking for financial security are likely to seek out a “variable,” “indexed,” “hybrid,” or other annuity type, insurance companies rely on their broker to explain the dubious virtues of these products.  And to convince their brokers to sell them, insurance companies offer  high commissions and lavish gifts, including iPads, cruises, and vacations to exotic Pacific islands.
This side of the annuity industry was the topic of a report issued by Senator Elizabeth Warren, which documented the tactics that insurance companies and marketing companies were using to reward brokers who sold the largest number of these high-priced policies.  Our California variable annuity attorneys have investigated many of these policies, which notably refrain from mentioning the financial rewards the broker receives for selling them, which can be as much as 15% of the total sale price.  In addition, the practice of lavishing non-monetary gifts on high producers is not something that insurance companies tend to publicize.
Variable annuities, indexed annuities, and numerous other varieties sold throughout California have any number of flaws that might end up harming seniors and retirees.  Often, they contain surrender charges, liquidity fees, management fees, and other costs and rules that are hidden in the 30 page contract that policyholders have to sign.  While it is the broker’s job to explain the policy to the client, the afore-mentioned rewards aren’t likely to induce them to be forthcoming about potential problems with the policy, or to recommend less lucrative alternatives.
In response to this problem, a new Department of Labor rule requires that brokers who earn commissions on annuity sales have to assume a fiduciary responsibility to their client.  Essentially, this requires that they act in their clients best financial interest.  While many consumers have be surprised to learn that brokers weren’t already required to do that, many annuity brokers and insurance companies in California and throughout the country are fighting back against this rule, either by suspending annuity sales, working around commissions, or drafting new language into their contract.  Hopefully, a few are actually going to improve training and reduce sales pressure on their brokers, to ensure that they can meet the demands of fiduciary responsibility.
Some of the major annuity and life insurance providers are:

Aviva/Athene/Accordia Life Insurance Company
Transamerica Life Insurance Company
 John Hancock Life Insurance Company
Bankers Life Insurance and Casualty company
 Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company  
 Midland Life Insurance Company
 North American Company for Life and Health Insurance
 Pacific Life Insurance Company
Prudential Life Insurance Company 
 Genworth Life Insurance Company 
 ING USA Annuity and Life Insurance Company 
 Lincoln Benefit Life Company 
Metlife/Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
Unum Life Insurance Company of America
Voya/Reliastar Life Insurance Company

If you or a loved one has purchased an indexed annuity, variable annuity, or other product in California, contact our annuity fraud attorneys at (415) 441-8669, or by email at info@evanslaw.com.  Our attorneys have experience handling cases involving complex financial agreements and large insurance companies.  We can help guide your case through a jury trial or toward an equitable settlement.
