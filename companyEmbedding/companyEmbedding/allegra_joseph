The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

POINT OF VIEW





For small tech companies to be successful against larger competitors, they need to provide products and support services that are much better than those competitors. How can they do this with fewer resources? By assembling small teams of talented and dedicated people. As an entrepreneur and a venture investor, I have led and been part of teams that were able to overcome enormous obstacles on the path to success. I firmly believe that great companies are the result of great teams working together to achieve shared goals.
