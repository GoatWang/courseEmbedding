Risk statistics

Alpha?Alpha is a measure of a fund's over- or under-performance by comparison to its benchmark. If the Alpha is 5, the fund has outperformed its benchmark by 5%; so the greater the Alpha, the greater the outperformance.6.72 
Beta?Beta estimates a fund's volatility by comparison to that of its benchmark. A fund with a beta close to 1 means that the fund will move generally in line with the benchmark. Higher than 1 and the fund is more volatile than the benchmark and vice versa.0.8 
Sharpe?This commonly-used measure calculates the level of return over and above the return of a notional risk-free investment, such as cash. The difference in returns is then divided by the fund's volatility. The resulting ratio is an indication of the amount of excess return generated per unit of risk.0.5 
Volatility?Volatility (or standard deviation), when applied to an investment fund, expresses its risk. It shows how widely a range of returns varied from the fund's average return over a particular period. For example, if a fund had an average return of 5%, and its volatility was 15, this would mean that the range of its returns over the period had swung between +20% and -10%.16.34 
Tracking error?This measures the standard deviation of a fund's excess returns over the returns of an index or benchmark portfolio. As such, it can be an indication of 'riskiness' in the manager's investment style. A Tracking Error below 2 suggests a passive approach. At 3 and above the the manager will be deploying a more active investment style.13.59 
Information ratio?This is a useful risk-adjusted measure of actively managed fund performance. It is calculated by deducting the returns of the fund's benchmark from the fund's overall returns, then dividing the result by its tracking error. The higher the Information Ratio the better. It is generally considered that a figure of 0.5 reflects a good performance, 0.75 very good, and 1.00 outstanding.0.33 
R-Squared?An indication of how closely correlated a fund is to an index or a benchmark. Values for R-Squared range between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no correlation at all and 1 showing a perfect match. Values upwards of 0.7 suggest that the fund's behaviour is increasingly linked to its benchmark.0.33

NameSinceBiography 

Sean Lenihan01/01/2013"Sean is CIO Japan Equity at Goodhart Partners. He is a permanent resident of Japan, where he has lived for the past 25 years. He is a graduate of Cambridge University, with an MA in Economics and is fluent in Japanese. He has been an analyst and portfolio manager of Japanese small, mid and large cap equity portfolios for over twenty years. After spending five years working with Yasuda Trust and Banking in their Head Office and Shibuya Branch in Tokyo in the late 1980s, Sean moved to Schroder Investment Management Japan (“Schroders”) where he worked first as a Large Cap Analyst before moving on to focus on small and mid-cap portfolios as an Analyst/Portfolio Manager. After seven years with Schroders Sean joined Scudder Investments (“Scudder”) as the Sub-Portfolio Manager for all of Scudder’s Japanese equity portfolios. He was subsequently promoted to
Lead Portfolio Manager after Deutsche Asset Management’s acquisition of Scudder, with responsibility for managing Japanese assets of USD 3-4 billion. Sean left Deutsche to join Wellington Management, where he was a Portfolio Manager and was subsequently promoted to Associate Partner. More recently he was a Portfolio Manager for Atlantis Investment Research Corporation (“AIRC”), from where he sub-advised the Hanjo Fund, before joining Goodhart directly in January 2013."
