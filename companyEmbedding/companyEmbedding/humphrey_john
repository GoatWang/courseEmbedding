Hire When it Kills


April 06, 2017
by John Humphrey



I have a friend who recently told me, "At my company, we don't hire when it hurts. We hire when it kills." He even added an expletive before the word "kills," but I left that out.Don't hire when it merely hurts, but hire when it absolutely kills. I think this is right. By the way, the same goes for "hiring" software or other technologies.Only when something starts to kill do you intimately know the problem, the underlying factors, and the effect it is having on your business and your life. When you know these things, you'll make a wiser hiring decision, giving you a better return on your money.If you hire when it merely hurts, you put money, control, and other people at risk because you don't have a full understanding of the problem you're facing.


 








Just Start Building


April 02, 2017
by John Humphrey



Have an idea that keeps you up at night?Just start building. A prototype. A collection of research. A slide deck. A landing page. Anything. Have a conversation about it. In most cases, you can start building with just some time, energy and very little money, if any.When you start building, you'll start hitting roadblocks. The roadblocks will get bigger as you go further, and the amount of energy you'll need to dedicate to get past the roadblocks will also grow. When this happens, you'll learn quickly whether the idea means something to you or not.If it means something to you, keep going. If it doesn't, don't worry too much about it. You probably won't invest much money, and you'll gain some new learning that you can use on the next one.It's always worth it to start building.

New Proportional iDP Valve – 390 and 391 Series



The iDP Series of aggressive media solenoid valves has expanded.  The diaphragm isolated 390 series 2-port proportional valve delivers a variable output flow of aggressive chemicals and cleaning fluids … from a corresponding variable input current to its solenoid.
Similar to the 350 series ON/OFF direct solenoid valve in flow, size and shape, the 390 is the first of its kind in proportional control. For example, users of the 390 Series may now control liquid chemical flow “rate” under variable pressure conditions, or may vary the chemical dilution when mixing with water.
Available as inline (390 Series) or as manifold (391 Series and to upstream pressure settings of 10, 20 and 40 psig.
For more information on Proportional iDP 390 Series, and all iDP Valves, download the updated iDP brochure.
 






Balanced Valve has new options, including IP67 Protection



The Humphrey Balanced Solenoid Valve family of 3- and 4-port direct acting valves now includes IP67 rated, environmentally protected models. 
Solenoid modifications and extensive testing has certified IP67 models to withstand dust ingress completely, and submersion in water to a depth of one meter over 30 minutes.  IP67 models are limited to DIN electrical entry and without override.  Humphrey DIN connector HS2-CLL is suitable for IP67 protection as well. 
The IP67 requirement is quite challenging, and therefore quite saleable to food processing and packaging OEMs and their end users, as well other moisture laden or wash down applications. 
Additionally, we’ve added fluorocarbon elastomers to the Balanced Valve offering for those chemical and temperature compatibility applications.  Finally, metric piping ports in both “G” and “Rc” threads are now available for OEMs marketing equipment internationally.
Download the brochure for more information.
 






ProControl Proportional Valve Driver - PCD



We are pleased to introduce our latest product within the Humphrey ProControl family, the PCD proportional valve driver. The PCD produces the appropriate current control, either constant current or PWM, to effectively drive any ProControl proportional valve upon receiving signal from a variety of data acquisition sources (ie PLCs, IoT, closed loop sensors, etc).
Ideally suited for product development, laboratories and production environments, the PCD is flexible and user friendly. The PCD features an LCD screen, scroll wheel and pushbutton parameter setting, and tool-less connectivity making set-up fast and easy. Pre-programming includes default settings for all Humphrey ProControl valves and a custom setting for unique application settings. Each PCD is shipped with installation instructions. Unlike competitive proportional valve drivers, the PCD is 100% programmable with fine setting control, no pots or switches to set, and capable of use with any proportional valve specified 1 amp or less with the “custom” setting. It accepts a variety of control signals, namely 0-5v, 0-10v or 4-20mA. Included is short circuit and reverse polarity protection.
