                              he existed at all. Did he? This challenging book examines the written and archaeological evidence critically in an effort
                              to paint an accurate picture of one of the Bible's central figures."--Jacket

                           Three major essays by Baruch Halpern, Brian Peckham and Paul E. Dion deal with traumatic changes in Israelite culture, in
                              particular the transition from the traditional culture of Israel in Iron Age IIA (tenth-ninth centuries) to a new, more widely
                              literate culture in the eighth-seventh centuries BCE. These essays throw into relief changes in legal, political and religious
                              culture in Judah in the last 150 years of its independence. Their combined implications for the origins of Western law and
                              civilization, and for the models from which Reformation and Enlightenment political theory were drawn

                           The birth of the West stems from the rejection of tradition. All our evidence for this influence comes from the Axial period,
                              800-400 BCE. Baruch Halpern explores the impact of changing cosmologies and social relations on cultural change in that era,
                              especially from Mesopotamia to Israel and Greece, but extending across the Mediterranean, not least to Egypt and Italy. In
                              this volume he shows how an explosion of international commerce and exchange, which can be understood as a Renaissance, led
                              to the redefinition of selfhood in various cultures and to Reformation. The process inevitably precipitated an Enlightenment.
                              This has happened over and over in human history and in academic or cultural fields. It is the basis of modernization, or
                              Westernization, wherever it occurs, and whatever form it takes

                              "Karl Jaspers dubbed the period, 800-400 BCE, the Axial Age. Axial it was, for out of it emerged the idea of Greek culture,
                                 with its influence on Roman and later empires. Jaspers' Axial Age was the chrysalis of culturally-meaningful modernity. Trade
                                 expands intellectual horizons. The economic and political effects permeate such social domains as technology, language and
                                 worldview. In the last category, many issues take on an emotional freight--the birth of science, monotheism, philosophy, even
                                 theory itself. Cultural Contact and Appropriation in the Axial-Age Mediterranean World : a Periplos, explores adaptation,
                                 resistance and reciprocity in Axial-Age Mediterranean exchange (ca. 800-300 BCE). Some essayists expand on an international
                                 discussion about myth, to which even the Church Fathers contributed. Others explore questions of how vocabulary is reapplied,
                                 or how the alphabet is reapplied, in a new environment. Detailed cases ground participants' capacity to illustrate both the
                                 variety of the disciplinary integuments in which we now speak, one with the other, across disciplines, and the sheer complexity

Why is this contact information displayed?  

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Baruch Halpern - Wikipedia





















 






Baruch Halpern

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Baruch Halpern is the Covenant Foundation Professor of Jewish Studies at the University of Georgia. He was a leader of the archaeological digs at Tel Megiddo 1992-2007,[1] as well as of an archaeological survey in southeastern Cilicia (Turkey).[2] As an undergraduate at Harvard in 1972, he wrote a political analysis of the Bible, which subsequently influenced research into its authorship.[3]
He is noted for his use of archaeological information to interpret the meaning of Biblical texts (for example, the explanation of Ehud's murder of King Eglon and escape without detection from the "upper room," see Judges 3:12-30, in Halpern's book The First Historians: The Hebrew Bible and History, pp. 55–59). He has said:

You cannot know the culture without knowing the material culture, either. So we need to combine text with what's in the ground, and, when our evidence is a little dirigible, we also need ethnological help, preferably from our region. This is no different in terms of reconstructing thought than needing to know the central and related languages involved.[2]

Halpern's theory of the development of Israelite monotheism, first articulated in a 1986 publication, involves the differentiation of the state god, YHWH, from his former subordinates and colleagues, collectively "the baal" or "the baals". This grew into alienation especially around and after the fall of Israel ca. 720 and the Assyrian devastation of Judah in 701. Economically, specialization and the operation of comparative advantage spread partly as a result of competing operative trade networks; this led to partial industrialization and to relative urbanization. Intellectually, the trade-driven renaissance in intellectual exchange provoked a Reformation, of which the reforms of Hezekiah (ca. 701) and Josiah (ca. 622) were manifestations (all 2009).
A lecture by Halpern on the Exodus (May 31 – June 1, 2013) is available on YouTube.
Major publications include:

From Gods to God (2009)
David's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, King (2003)
The Rise of Ancient Israel: Symposium at the Smithsonian Institution (1991, with Hershel Shanks, William Dever, and P. Kyle McCarter)
The Emergence of Israel in Canaan (1983)

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREDavid's Secret Demons: Messiah, Murderer, Traitor, Kingby Halpern, BaruchBiblical tradition portrays King David as an exceptional man and a paragon of godly devotion. But was he? Some scholars deny that he existed at all. Did he? This challenging book critically examines the textual and archaeological evidence in an effort to paint an accurate picture of one of the Bible's central figures.A leading scholar of biblical history and the ancient Near East, Baruch Halpern traces the development of the David tradition, showing how the image of David grew over time. According to Halpern, David was the founder of a dynasty that progressively exaggerated his accomplishments. Halpern's clear portrait of the historical David reveals his true humanity and shows him to be above all a politician who operated in a rough-and-tumble environment in which competitors were ready literally to slit throats.Old Testament, Old TestamentCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
