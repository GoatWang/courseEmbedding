TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Northwest Pipeline LLC (“Northwest”), a wholly owned subsidiary of 
      Williams Partners L.P. (NYSE: WPZ), announced that it has priced its 
      previously announced offering of senior notes.
    

      The $250 million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due 2027, 
      scheduled to be delivered on April 3, 2017, were priced with a 4.000 
      percent coupon and at an offering price of 99.641 percent of par, with a 
      yield to investors of 4.044 percent.
    

      Northwest intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay its 
      $185 million of 5.95% Senior Notes due 2017 upon their maturity on April 
      15, 2017, and for general corporate purposes.
    

      The notes are being offered pursuant to certain exemptions from 
      registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 
      “Securities Act”). The offering of the notes has not been registered 
      under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. The notes 
      may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or 
      an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.
    

      This press release is for informational purposes only and does not 
      constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the 
      notes described in this press release, nor shall there be any sale of 
      the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, sale or 
      solicitation would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification 
      under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
    

      Portions of this document may constitute “forward-looking statements” as 
      defined by federal law. Although Northwest believes any such statements 
      are based on reasonable assumptions, there is no assurance that actual 
      outcomes will not be materially different. Additional information about 
      issues that could lead to material changes in performance is contained 
      in Northwest’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities 
      and Exchange Commission.

MARKET WATCH: Crude ends brief rally as energy prices decline

|

EPA updates air-quality standards for annual fine PM























Tesoro buys Chevron's Northwest Products System








HOUSTON, Dec. 14


12/14/2012



By
Christopher E. Smith


Managing Editor, Technology






































Tesoro Corp. affiliate Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) bought Chevron Pipe Line Co.’s Northwest Products System. The system consists of the 760-mile Northwest Product Pipeline (NPP), a separate 5-mile jet fuel pipeline to the Salt Lake City International Airport, and the Northwest Terminalling Co. (NTC).
NPP extends from Salt Lake City to Spokane, Wash. It receives product from five refineries and one pipeline in the Salt Lake City area and is the primary transportation option from Salt Lake City to Pocatello and Boise, Ida., and Pasco and Spokane, Wash. Delivery volumes on the system averaged about 84,000 b/d in 2011.
NTC is comprised of refined products terminals in Boise, Pocatello, and Pasco. The terminals have a total storage capacity of 1.3 million bbl and delivered 51,000 b/d in 2011.
Tesoro spent $400 million on the acquisition. Subject to regulatory approval, the company expects it purchase to close first-quarter 2013. TLLP launched an amendment and upsizing of its $300 million revolving credit facility to $500 million on Dec. 7 to support this purchase and future growth opportunities.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
