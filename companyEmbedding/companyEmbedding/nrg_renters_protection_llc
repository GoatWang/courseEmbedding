	NRG

	), as borrower, completed an amendment to its senior secured credit facility (the 

	Senior Credit Facilities

	) pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2017 (the 

	Amendment Agreement

	), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2016 (the 

	Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

	), to reduce the margin on certain borrowings under its Senior Credit Facilities.




	 




	Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities are determined at NRGs election, at LIBOR or at base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The Amendment Agreement decreases the applicable margins for borrowings under (i) ABR Term Loans from 1.75% to 1.25% and (ii) Eurodollar Term Loans from 2.75% to 2.25%, as such terms are defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The decreases to the applicable margins became effective upon execution of the Amendment Agreement.

	dated as of January 24, 2017 (this 

	First Amendment

	) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of June 30, 2016 (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time and immediately prior to the First Amendment Effective Date (as defined below)) (the 

	), the Lenders from time to time parties thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent (in such capacity and together with its successors, the 

	Administrative Agent

	) and as collateral agent (in such capacity and together with its successors, the 

	Collateral Agent

	).



	 




	A.            Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below).




	 




	B.            The Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank, among others, are parties to the Credit Agreement.  Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are acting as joint book runners and joint lead arrangers in connection with this First Amendment (in such capacities, the 

	C.            The Borrower has requested pursuant to Section 9.08(b) of the Credit Agreement that the Required Lenders consent to (i) reduce the Applicable Margin for the Term Loans on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in in this First Amendment and in the Credit Agreement and (ii) make certain other changes to the Loan Documents as more fully set forth herein.




	 




	D.            Each Term Lender under the Credit Agreement (collectively, the 

	Existing Term Lenders

	) that fails to execute and deliver a signature page to this First Amendment by 12:00 p.m. (New York City time), on January 19, 2017 (the 

	E.            Each Lender that executes and delivers a signature page to this Amendment on or prior to the First Amendment Effective Date (as defined below) (the 

	Consenting Lenders

	) will be deemed to have irrevocably agreed to the terms of this First Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement, subject to the conditions to effectiveness set forth herein.




	 




	F.             By executing and delivering a signature page to this First Amendment, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders will be deemed upon the First Amendment Effective Date to have irrevocably agreed to the terms of this First Amendment and the Amended Credit Agreement.




	 




	G.            The amendments to the Credit Agreement set forth below are subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to effectiveness referred to herein and shall become effective as provided herein.




	 












	 




	Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:




	 





	SECTION 1. 


	Amendments to Credit Agreement

	.




	 




	(i) Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended or, as the case may be, amended and restated by:




	 





	(A) 

	adding thereto the following new defined terms in proper alphabetical order:




	 




	

	First Amendment

	 shall mean the First Amendment Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2017, among the Borrower, each Subsidiary Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders party thereto.




	 




	

	First Amendment Effective Date

	 shall have the meaning assigned to such term in the First Amendment.




	 





	(B) 

	amending and restating the following defined terms therein in their entirety as follows:




	 




	

	(ii)

	            Section 2.12(d) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by replacing the words the Closing Date in each instance where such words appear therein with the words the First Amendment Effective Date.



	 




	(iii) As used in the Credit Agreement, the terms Agreement, this Agreement, herein, hereinafter, hereto, hereof, and words of similar import shall, unless the context otherwise requires, mean, from and after the First Amendment Effective Date, the Credit Agreement as amended by this First Amendment.




	 





	SECTION 2. 


	Non-Consenting Lenders

	. The Borrower has given notice to each Non-Consenting Lender that, upon receipt of consents to this First Amendment from the existing Lenders constituting the Required Lenders, such Non-Consenting Lender shall, pursuant to Section 9.08(c) of the Credit Agreement, execute or be deemed to have executed a counterpart of an Assignment and Assumption and shall in accordance therewith sell its existing Terms Loans as specified in the applicable Assignment and Assumption or any other similar document.  Pursuant to the applicable Assignment and Assumption or other similar document, each Non-Consenting Lender has sold and assigned the principal amount of its existing Term Loans to Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as assignee (in such capacity the 

	Replacement Lender

	) under such document, solely upon the consent and acceptance by the Replacement Lender.  The Replacement Lender has executed and delivered a signature page to this First Amendment on or prior to the First Amendment Effective Date as a Consenting Lender.




	 





	SECTION 3. 


	Representations and Warranties

	.  To induce the other parties hereto to enter into this First Amendment, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Guarantor represents and warrants to each of the Lenders, the Swingline Lender, each Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent that, as of the First Amendment Effective Date:




	 



	2













	 





	(a)

	(c) 

	This First Amendment shall constitute a Loan Document for all purposes under the Amended Credit Agreement and a Security Document (as defined in the Collateral Trust Agreement) for all purposes under the Collateral Trust Agreement, and shall be administered and construed pursuant to the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
