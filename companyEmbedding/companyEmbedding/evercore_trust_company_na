Independent Fiduciary Roles
Settlements
When an employee benefit plan participates in a litigation settlement, there is often a potential conflict of interest between the plan and the settling defendants. The United States Department of Labor (DOL) has determined that a plan's release of its potential claims against the defendant company and/or plan fiduciaries in settling such litigation may be a prohibited transaction under ERISA.  To address this potential prohibited transaction, the DOL requires that plans subject to ERISA retain an independent fiduciary to evaluate the settlement and ultimately approve the plan's participation in the settlement.
In its role as an independent fiduciary in connection with litigation settlements, Evercore Trust decides whether to approve a plan's participation in the litigation settlement based on an assessment of the fairness of the terms of the settlement. As part of this determination, we evaluate the terms of the settlement and the costs and risks of further litigation. Depending on the nature of our engagement, we also may oversee the plan trustee's submission of the plan's proof of claim.
Since the issuance of the DOL's prohibited transaction exemption for litigation settlements in 2003, Evercore Trust has served as independent fiduciary with respect to more than 85 settlements, with a total value of approximately $11.2 billion.

Trustee Services
Grantor-Rabbi Trusts for Non-Qualified Plans
When an employer establishes a rabbi trust to secure benefits for participants in a non-qualified excess plan, top-hat plan, board of directors' plan, or other executive deferred compensation plan, Evercore Trust may be retained as trustee of the rabbi trust. With our in-depth experience in change-of-control and change-of-heart situations, we can hold and invest trust assets pursuant to the trust agreement, providing another layer of security to beneficiaries of a deferred compensation plan.
Evercore Trust can assist with investing these deferrals in a variety of tax-advantaged investment vehicles. Our responsibilities as trustee may include:

Asset custody
Defending the trust and interests of plan participants against hostile takeovers
Determining participants' entitlement to distributions after a change in control
Administering plan distributions
Reporting

For more information, please contact Richard Murray at (888) 296-2903.

History







History
Our business was founded as part of U.S. Trust in 1987 to provide specialized fiduciary and related services to employee benefit 
							plans. Acting as an independent fiduciary for employee benefit plans, we quickly assumed a leading role in our field, particularly 
							for plans holding major blocks of employer stock.
						
U.S. Trust was purchased by the Charles Schwab Corporation in 2000 and subsequently by Bank of America in 2007. Evercore established 
							Evercore Trust in connection with its acquisition of U.S. Trust's Independent Fiduciary Services business from Bank of America in 2009.
						
Our commitment to client service remains unchanged. Evercore Trust continues to be a pioneer in shaping standards for independent 
							fiduciary services.

Investments in Employer Stock
Proxy Voting
Many investment committees and plan trustees bear fiduciary responsibility for proxy voting in connection with company stock held in employee benefit plans. In some cases, a proxy issue may create a conflict between the committee's fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA and the business interests of the plan sponsor. In such instances, Evercore Trust is often engaged to:
							
Oversee the pass-through of voting on company stock allocated to plan participant accounts
Vote stock when voting instructions are not timely received by plan participants
Vote stock held in defined benefit pension plans

Â 

Is Evercore Wealth Management right for me?
CLOSE
Â 

Our firm serves high net worth individuals and families across the United States, from offices in New York, Tampa, Minneapolis and San Francisco. Clients include entrepreneurs in a wide range of fields, from technology to real estate to the arts, business executives, financial services professionals, and multigenerational inheritors. They have investable assets ranging from $5 million to hundreds of millions.
Â 
All of our clients value independent advice and direct relationships with the senior professionals who manage their wealth.
Â 
Feel free to contact us with any questions you might have about our firm and our distinctive approach to wealth management.
Â 
Â 



What is the relationship between Evercore Wealth Management and Evercore?
CLOSE
Â 

Evercore Wealth Management is the U.S. wealth management subsidiary of Evercore, the global independent investment banking advisory firm founded by Roger Altman in 1995 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: EVR). Evercore owns 62.5% of Evercore Wealth Management; partners in our firm own the remaining equity.
Â 
Evercoreâs Investment Banking business advises its clients on a wide range of transactions and issues and provides institutional investors with high quality equity research, sales and trading execution that is free of the conflicts created by proprietary activities. Evercoreâs Investment Management business comprises wealth management and institutional asset management. Evercore serves a diverse set of clients around the world from 27 offices and affiliate offices in North America, Europe, South America and Asia. More information about Evercore can be found on the companyâs website at www.evercore.com.
Â 
A related company, Evercore Trust N.A. was established in 2009 as a national trust bank, delivering specialized investment management, independent fiduciary and trustee services to employee benefit plans. Evercore Trust additionally provides personal trustee, executor, and custody services to high net worth individuals and families in combination with Evercore Wealth Management.
Â 
Â 



What does integrated goals-based wealth management mean to me? How does it differ    from the practices at most financial services firms? 
CLOSE
Â 

Every client at the firm is served by at least two senior professionals, a wealth advisor and a portfolio manager, who will come to know you and your family well, and who will be directly accountable to you for the decisions they make on your behalf. We have one of the lowest turnover rates in the business and are committed to long-term relationships.
Â 
Your Evercore Wealth Management professionals work together as a team, with each other and, as needed, with your other advisors, to fully integrate and execute planning and investment decisions to help you reach your financial goals. Thatâs a very different approach than is practiced at many other firms. At Evercore Wealth Management, we are free from the bureaucracy and conflicts of interests inherent at many financial services firms.
Â 
Your Evercore Wealth Management team is supported by the full resources of our national firm and by our colleagues at Evercore Trust N.A., and Evercore. We are able to manage complex situations and plan for multi-generational families and philanthropic legacies.

Â 
Â 



Why is independent advice important to high net worth clients? 
CLOSE
Â 

The interests of our partners are aligned with those of our clients. That means a commitment to what some of our colleagues describe as âradical transparency.â
Â 
We donât adhere to one-size-fits-all asset allocation models and we donât push investment product. Instead, we create a customized asset allocation process for each client based solely on the prospect of achieving success relative to that clientâs specific objectives and constraints.
Â 
We design and manage discrete pools of capital with the goal of meeting specific objectives such as lifestyle requirements, wealth accumulation and preservation, and legacy aspirations. Our fee structure is simple, across all asset classes.
Â 
We measure our success by both competitive benchmarks and by meeting each clientâs goals.
Â 
Â 



What does Evercore Wealth Management mean by direct relationships?
CLOSE
Â 

We know how important a real relationship with their advisors is to our clients and to their families. Itâs important to us as well. We founded this firm in part because we have no interest in navigating large bureaucracies or pushing one-size-fits-all solutions.
Â 
We know that private investors are best served by a real connection with investment professionals and planning professionals who manage their wealth.
Â 
Â 



What is the investment process at Evercore Wealth Management?
CLOSE
Â 

Our client portfolios are shaped by client aspirations and constraints and managed in that context in an effort to drive the best possible after-tax, after-fee returns.
Â 
We have world-class capabilities in global asset allocation, defensive and growth investment strategies, and external manager selection and review. We accommodate existing holdings, including concentrated stock positions, in customized portfolios across a range of asset classes defined by their risk and liquidity characteristics. We manage these portfolios through a process we call Efficient Architecture, which combines our proprietary expertise and carefully selected external investments.
Â 
We are proud of our performance, as measured both by competitive benchmarks and by our success in meeting our clientsâ goals.
Â 
Â 



Does Evercore Wealth Management provide trust and fiduciary services?
CLOSE
Â 

Evercore Wealth Management provides clients with personal trust, custody and executor services through its affiliated national trust company, Evercore Trust Company, N.A. Evercore Trust was established in 2009 and delivers specialized investment management, independent fiduciary, and trustee services to employee benefit plans, as well as services to high net worth individuals and families in combination with Evercore Wealth Management.
Â 
Our trust officers, who are among the most experienced professionals in the industry, work closely with our clients to create innovative, flexible and timely solutions that carry out the clientsâ intentions and maintain the well-being of the beneficiaries.
Â

Â 
Â 



What does Evercore Wealth Management mean by partnership values?
CLOSE
Â 

Many of us have worked together for years, sharing our experience and best thinking to serve our clients and to build and invest in this firm together. We also work as partners with our colleagues at Evercore, the global independent investment banking firm, and at Evercore Trust Company N.A., an affiliated national trust company. Most important, we work directly with our clients, delivering independent advice and investment expertise free of the conflicts at many financial institutions.
Â 
In other words, our interests are aligned with yours.
Â 
Â 



Does the firm provide family office services? 
CLOSE
Â 

We deliver a full suite of family wealth management services, working closely with our clients, their other advisors and, if applicable, their family offices. Our services include:
Â 


Consolidated investment and performance reporting for families and related entities
Tax planning
External services coordination, including insurance (life, medical, property/casualty), valuation firms, healthcare, tax/accounting, legal and business consulting) 
Philanthropic planning and management  
Intergenerational planning and education 
Alternative asset administration
Management of information flow to tax and legal advisors
Family trust disbursements 


Â 
Â 



Does Evercore Wealth Management work with institutional clients?
CLOSE
Â 

We serve individuals, families, and related foundations at Evercore Wealth Management. We work with our colleagues at Evercore Trust Company to serve other institutional clients. For information on Evercore Trust, please visit: www.evercoretrust.com.
Â 
Â 



What is Independent Thinking?
CLOSE
Â 

Independent Thinking is the quarterly journal of Evercore Wealth Management, reflecting the thought leadership of the firm, our colleagues at Evercore and Evercore Trust and selected external advisors. We produce related communications, seminars and customized events for our clients.
Â 
Â 



What other client services does Evercore Wealth Management provide?
CLOSE
Â 

We provide a range of educational services, including our Independent Thinking series of events and materials focused on thoughtful giving, philanthropy, impact investing, special needs and special purpose trusts, Baby Boomers, Generation X and socially responsible investing. Our Wise Women program is dedicated to engaging and empowering women of all ages to take responsibility for their financial futures and contribute to their familyâs wellbeing.
Â 
Â 



How does Evercore Wealth Management ensure that my assets are secure?
CLOSE
Â 

Evercore Trust Company, an affiliated company, is the primary custodian of client assets at Evercore Wealth Management. Evercore Trust is a national trust bank, regulated and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Evercore Trust uses SEI Private Trust Company as its subcustodian to provide custody and recordkeeping services for its clientsâ accounts. As trust companies, both Evercore Trust and SEI Private Trust Company segregate the assets they hold in custody on behalf of clients from their own assets. Client assets are therefore not subject to the claims of any creditors of the trust companies.
Â 
Â 



How do I open an account with Evercore Wealth Management?
CLOSE
Â 

Qualified investors with $5 million or more in investable assets can open an account with Evercore Wealth Management by signing our investment management agreement and related documents. We begin the process of understanding your goals and wealth planning considerations immediately and we begin supervising the account as soon as the agreement is received. We will work with you to transfer your assets from your current custodian to Evercore Trust Company or we will work with you and your designated custodian to grant discretionary trading authority to us. We are happy to work with your existing advisors, including your attorney and accountant.
Â 
Â 



How do I learn more about Evercore Wealth Management?
CLOSE
Â 

Come meet us. The essence of our firm is in our people and the ways in which we work together to help our clients achieve their goals. Weâll introduce you to several members of our team and take the time to understand your unique goals and circumstances. Youâll be able to experience firsthand why families are choosing Evercore Wealth Management as their trusted advisor.
