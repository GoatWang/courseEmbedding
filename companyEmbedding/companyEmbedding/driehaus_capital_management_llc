Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) are generally medium to long-term investments. CIS portfolios are traded at ruling prices and can engage in borrowing and script lending. A schedule of fees and charges, and maximum commission, is available on request from the manager. The value of investments, and the income from them, can go down as well as up, and you may not recover the amount of your original investment. Where investments involve exposure to a currency other than that in which the fund is denominated, changes in rates of exchange may cause the value of the investment to go up or down. Consequently, investors may receive an amount greater or less than their original investment. Performance methodologies can be obtained upon request from VAM Funds [email protected]
All rates of return include reinvested dividends and are net of all management and performance fees.
Details on the calculation of performance fees, where applicable, can be obtained by contacting [email protected]
