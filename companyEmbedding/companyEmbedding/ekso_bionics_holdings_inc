RICHMOND, Calif., July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EKSO), an industry leader in exoskeleton technology for medical and industrial use, today announced that its board of directors has approved a proposed rights offering to raise gross proceeds of up to $34,000,000.
The rights offering is proposed to be made through the pro rata distribution of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase, in the aggregate, up to 34,000,000 shares of the company's common stock at a subscription price of $1.00 per share, to shareholders and certain warrant holders of the company on the record date of August 10, 2017.  
Each holder of shares of common stock as of the record date will receive, at no charge, one subscription right for each share of common stock owned on the record date, and certain holders of warrants issued by the company on the record date will receive subscription rights pursuant to the terms of the warrants.
Each holder of subscription rights will have a basic subscription right to purchase its pro rata portion of the shares of common stock offered in the proposed rights offering.  The proposed rights offering will also include an over-subscription right, which will entitle a rights holder who exercises all of its basic subscription right in full the opportunity to purchase additional shares of common stock up to the amount of its basic subscription right, subject to the availability and pro rata allocation of shares among rights holders exercising their over-subscription right.
Puissance Capital Management ("Puissance"), pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into between Puissance and the company, has committed to purchase, at the subscription price of $1.00 per share, any unsubscribed shares of common stock following exercise of the basic subscription right, provided that the number of shares purchased by Puissance is subject to a cap such that Puissance will not own more than 40% of the company's outstanding shares of common stock following the proposed rights offering.
The shares of common stock to be sold to Puissance pursuant to the purchase agreement will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. The Company has agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of the securities to be sold to Puissance pursuant to the purchase agreement.
The company is planning to commence the proposed rights offering in August of 2017 in order to raise equity capital in a timely and cost-effective manner, while providing its shareholders the opportunity to participate.  The commencement and expiration dates of the rights offering will be included in the prospectus supplement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the commencement of the proposed rights offering.
The company intends to use the net proceeds from the proposed rights offering to (i) expand clinical, sales and marketing initiatives to accelerate adoption of the Ekso in the rehabilitation market and broaden the Ekso footprint into Asia, (ii) to increase research, development and commercialization activities with respect to an Ekso robotic exoskeleton for home use, and/or (iii) in the development and commercialization of able-bodied exoskeletons for industrial use, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
The company reserves the right to modify, postpone or cancel the proposed rights offering at any time prior to the closing of the sale of the shares of common stock in the proposed rights offering.
The proposed rights offering will be made pursuant to the company's effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-218517) on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information herein is not complete and is subject to change. Investors should consider the company's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The base prospectus contains this and additional information about the company and the prospectus supplement to be filed at the commencement of the proposed rights offering will contain this and additional information about the rights offering, and should be read carefully before investing. You may obtain these documents for free at the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission, www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Company will arrange to send you the registration statement, including the prospectus, if you request it from the contact persons listed at the bottom of this release.
This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor will there be any sales of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.

Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest, Product Failure And Paid Stock Promotion - Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:EKSO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ekso Bionics: Strong Sell With -92.3% Downside On Fraud Arrest, Product Failure And Paid Stock PromotionJun. 2.15 | About: Ekso Bionics (EKSO) The Pump Stopper Long/short equity, short only, special situations, contrarianPump Stopper: Unclogging Stock Market Detritus 




SummaryEKSO insider Adam Gottbetter jailed for fraud, while other EKSO individuals face further allegations. SEC's FOIA shows EKSO facing (or faced?) law enforcement investigation, where is EKSO's disclosure on this?Boston Dynamics states "nothing to do with EKSO" and any work together completed months ago, Lockhead states FORTIS "not an Ekso product" and "independently designed" by LMT and Robrady.Previously presented EKSO “Charter Clinics” now supporting competing products, and stating competitor products are superior. Industry shift towards rental/lease leaves under-capitalized EKSO in an impossible situation.Huge global companies now competing with EKSO and demonstrably superior and cheaper products. EKSO's founder left the company and founded competing company with 1/3 the price and 1/2 the weight.Accelerating cash burn, product failure and EKSO's financial architect jailed for fraud as insiders register to sell stock with paid stock promotion make 35x sales and ~$200m valuation clearly unsustainable.I believe EKSO is an offensive reverse-merger where insider and EKSO's financial architect, responsible for temporarily dodging a 2013 EKSO bankruptcy, was recently jailed for fraud. Furthermore, a SEC FOIA response received shows EKSO is facing, or faced, a law enforcement investigation. I am shocked to find no EKSO disclosure, which leaves investors in the dark about the extent of any potential issues or what is going on.

Industry research also shows EKSO is now nothing more than a "hype machine" with no hope of commercial success. Multiple large global juggernauts have apparently displaced EKSO at many of the company's past "Charter Clinics" as previous partners now tout competitor's products as superior.

An analysis of all EKSO employees on LinkedIn show the company imploding internally as key employees depart en-masse. Despite having just 69 full-time employees, in the past few years, EKSO has churned through ~100 employees, with 2/3 of them not even lasting past 1 year. Successful businesses about to rapidly grow sales do not have this kind of attrition, leading me to believe EKSO's sales ramp is impossible.
With less than $6m of revenue and -$15m per year cash burn, EKSO will run out of cash again in early 2016. EKSO's CEO Nathan Harding presided over near-bankruptcy in 2013 and was forced to stop paying approximately half of EKSO employees. The only meaningful capital the company has been able to raise was done with partners now jailed for fraud or charged with other violations. With those sketchy partners unavailable, when EKSO's cash runs out in ~9 months, I expect the company's bankruptcy is likely. Given everything above, EKSO's current ~$200m valuation, or >35x revenue, is clearly absurd and I believe is only temporarily possible due to EKSO's >60% unsophisticated retail shareholder base and EKSO's paid stock promotion. Supporting this view, EKSO insiders have registered to sell stock.
I applaud any medical patients finding any relief from any offering anywhere, but from an investor and financial standpoint EKSO is an obvious disaster that is imploding as we speak. Generously valuing EKSO similar to peers shows imminent -84.51% downside with more likely outcome of bankruptcy and total investor wipeout, similar to other Adam Gottbetter deals and stocks using paid stock promotion (more below).
EKSO Insider and Financial Architect Adam Gottbetter Jailed for Fraud
Ironically named, Adam Gottbetter is the financial architect and creator of EKSO through the reverse merger and financing which temporarily helped EKSO avoid bankruptcy in 2013 when EKSO ran out of cash and was forced to stop paying ~50% of its workforce.
Adam Gottbetter was an EKSO insider as we can see where he is listed as EKSO contact person for this 11/2013 EKSO SEC filing. I believe that without Gottbetter, EKSO would have clearly gone bankrupt in 2013 when EKSO basically ran out of money and had to "pause" the company for nearly a year. Unfortunately for EKSO shareholders, Adam Gottbetter recently pleads guilty to fraud and is serving time in jail, according to thedeal.com:

"Investment bank Gottbetter Capital Markets LLC arranged at least 15 PIPEs from 2008 through May 2014, raising $96.1 million for companies including Ekso Bionics Holdings Inc.……..The SEC action against Gottbetter included allegations that he and others manipulated shares…"
Adam Gottbetter: Not Smiling Anymore…

(Picture credit TheDeal)
You can find the SEC's press release here:
"The three rehearsed stories they would tell if ever questioned by law enforcement. During one meeting in New York City, Gottbetter complained about the difficulties of stock manipulation but conceded that robbing a bank was the only other way to make so much money so quickly."
Offensively, Adam seems to have used his gains to finance a lavish lifestyle, including a $12.9 million Manhattan penthouse, complete with separate $1m living quarters for his maid.
Gottbetter's playbook was simple: acting as attorney, he helped low-quality companies with no hope of future success (like EKSO seems to be) go public via reverse-merger. His firm Gottbetter Capital Markets provided necessary cash where Gottbetter would get a piece of the action so he could, after promotional campaigns kicked in, dump his stock on the market before it collapses worthlessly.
In an embarrassingly bad interview with disgraced stock tout Tobin Smith, Gottbetter took the opportunity to promote Gran Tierra Energy (NYSEMKT:GTE) as one of the most "successful deals he was ever involved in." Gran Tierra was later exposed by Barron's as a hard glossy-mailer stock promotion campaign in which Gottbetter participated. Another attorney in the Gran Tierra scandal was charged by the SEC for securities fraud and it appears Gottbetter regularly partnered with individuals charged with penny stock manipulation.

One of the broker dealers named alongside Gottbetter in the EKSO Form D is "EDI Financial" which was recently censored by FINRA for allegedly making inappropriate private placement investments while "Dinosaur Securities LLC" also participated with Gottbetter and has also had many alleged disciplinary problems with FINRA. This 5/7/2014 S-1 filing shows EKSO insiders associated with Gottbetter registered to sell an estimated 950,912 shares while on the other side of the trade (unsurprisingly) we find 62%+ of EKSO shares are held by unsophisticated retail investors. Does this seem fair to you?
I believe it is obvious that EKSO management must know what is going on as the company's CEO Nathan Harding co-signed SEC documents with Adam Gottbetter while even a basic Google search shows numerous concerning allegations against Gottbetter and associates going back to at least 2007. Why did Nathan Harding and EKSO willingly choose to partner with Gottbetter, when they should have Knewbetter? Are these the kind of people you should trust or give your hard-earned money to?
To decipher a pattern for EKSO, let's look at other Gottbetter deals:
Boldface Group (OTCPK:BLBK)

Charys Holding Corporation

HBP Energy (OTCPK:HBPE)


Kentucky USA Energy (OTC:KYUS)

LifeApps Digital Media (OTCPK:LFAP)

Mesa Energy Holdings

Nevada Gold Holdings

Rackwise (OTCPK:RACK)

(all charts from Capiq)
EKSO Also Partnered with Opaleye's James Silverman, Who Faced Insider Trading Charges
Shockingly, it's not just Gottbetter as James Silverman's Opaleye Management is EKSO's second largest shareholder and has recently been attempting to sell EKSO stock. Opaleye, previously known as "Risk Reward Capital", was apparently pursued for insider trading by the Secretary of the State of Massachusetts who accused Silverman of using an "expert network" to obtain inside information in a quest to improve dismal returns.

*Edit/update: I am told Silverman and Massachusettes settled their differences in an out-of-court settlement
SEC filings show Silverman owns 10.9m shares of EKSO through Opaleye and Silverman Insurance Partnership, making him one of EKSO's largest shareholders. In a March 25, 2015, securities registration, Silverman is listed as attempting to sell at least 2,000,000 (!!) shares of EKSO stock which Silverman/Opaleye acquired in January 2014 directly, with Gottbetter (from CapitalIQ):
"Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. announced a private placement on best efforts basis of 20,580,000 units at $1 per unit for gross proceeds of $20,580,000 on January 15, 2014. Each unit consists of one common share and one share purchase warrant. Each warrant is exercisable at $2 per share for a period of five years. The transaction included participation from Opaleye L.P, a fund managed by Opaleye Management Inc., Montrose Capital Group, LLC, and other investors. Gottbetter Capital Markets, LLC, acted as the exclusive placement agent for the best efforts transaction and EDI Financial, Inc. acted as a sub-agent."
Interestingly, within months of Gottbetter's EKSO reverse merger, both Silverman and Gottbetter filed to sell a large amount of stock in 5/2014. Curiously just prior to this, EKSO stock "mysteriously" rallied dramatically for no apparent reason. Given charges of market manipulation to people associated with EKSO, you can make your own speculations how and why that happened. Regardless, we know one thing with certainty: EKSO insiders were in a hurry to sell stock as EKSO worked with the SEC in an attempted acceleration of its registration effective date:
Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc., hereby requests that the Securities and Exchange Commission accelerate the effective date of the above-referenced Registration Statement"
EKSO's questionable insiders clearly missed that very brief "window" when EKSO stock rallied as the original offering appears to have failed. Tellingly though, (see below), insiders have once again filed to sell stock (at a much lower price) while EKSO stock has more than doubled off the bottom, again for no apparent reason.

Unsurprisingly, Silverman and Gottbetter affiliates have again filed to sell a large amount of EKSO stock in a March 2015 registration. Affiliates of Gottbetter also registered to sell stock in this filing, although it's unclear what will happen to Gottbetter's EKSO stock now that he's in jail, will it be dumped onto the market? If EKSO was such an amazing opportunity why would insiders register to sell stock at $2 or lower?
SEC's FOIA Response: EKSO Subject of an Ongoing Law Enforcement Investigation?
Given what we have seen above, I find this SEC FOIA response received last year to be concerning.

We know FOIA 7(a) exemptions are used during active law enforcement investigations. We also know, from the Gottbetter trial, that he received a lighter trial by supplying additional information about his associates so we don't know how deep that investigation is or who it may be targeting. Since EKSO has not disclosed any information about this, I don't know what is going on exactly, but with EKSO's financial architect in jail sharing information with federal authorities, along with all the other EKSO issues explained below, I am very concerned.

Consistent with the Gottbetter playbook, EKSO claims vague "partnerships" with random companies and uses paid stock promotion by the dubious offshore firm Edison whose reports appear dressed up to look like real Wall Street research but fine print clarifies seem to just be paid stock promotion:


(credit Edison "Research")
In this light I find interesting, EKSO's management consistently fails to disclose the amount or extent of any partnership it gets while playing "fast and loose" with the facts. For example, EKSO touts incessantly hype a Boston Dynamics relationship which curiously had zero quotes from Boston Dynamics itself in the press release. It seems this "partnership" was so important that it didn't even merit a single public statement by Boston Dynamics.
Further research to Boston Dynamics resulted in the response "we have nothing to do with that company" with an abrupt end to the conversation. A second email from Boston Dynamics confirmed any relationship that ever existed ended months ago.
EKSO touts also repeatedly promote past work with Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) but a call to LMT confirmed FORTIS is "not an EKSO product" and "Fortis was independently developed by Lockheed Martin with support from Robrady Design". Further research with Robrady design also turns up zero mention of EKSO but instead states it was a Lockheed Martin project which was apparently gone through "from the ground up". What is really going on here? Until Lockheed Martin comes out with a public press release clarifying this, I don't think any of us know what reality is.
Not that it even matters though as EKSO's SEC filings state after 2017 LMT will have exclusive rights to the military market anyway, cutting EKSO off regardless, while there is no hope of EKSO competing against a globally dominant manufacturing company like LMT in any capacity. No wonder insiders want to cash out, who could blame them?
Lastly, on the Q4 call investors asked EKSO management for any color (at all?!) on the latest claimed agreement with Ottobock. Unsurprisingly, EKSO management refused to provide any color on the extent, financial terms or really anything at all and simply passed over the question instead responding with vague and useless "validation" hype.
EKSO has also repeatedly fed investors false promises about its own future and repeatedly missed its own goals. For instance, after originally saying EKSO would have a home use personal product done by 2013, in this article EKSO stated in 2012 it would have a personal mobility device by 2014. Then in this later article EKSO also stated again and again it would have a personal EKSO in the market in 2014. Despite all this hype about EKSO entering the home market, in EKSO SEC filings (where the consequences of deception are much higher) EKSO states its "exploration of this potential market is in the very early stages".

I believe this is likely because in the ReWalk (NASDAQ:RWLK) FDA disclosures we can see that a consistent speed for 10m+ of 0.40 meters per second (a function of necessary time to cross a street) as apparently critical. Unfortunately, the EKSO suit is just too weak and clumsy to ever achieve this speed hurdle by the comfortable margin it seems is necessary for FDA approval, effectively making FDA clearance for the home market an impossibility for EKSO's suit.
The only financial details I can find on EKSO partnerships are that EKSO has generated just ~$1m in total licensing revenue since inception, which is immaterial for a ~$200m valued company. We also know if one customer is 10% of revenue, all public companies are required by the SEC to disclose that. So if EKSO announces a partnership without mention of financial terms and it is not disclosed in detail in SEC filings you can know that it may be anywhere between $0 of revenue to 9.99% of revenue, which given EKSO's tiny total revenue, is telling.
EKSO Technology Already Failing, With Superior Products and Global Juggernauts Entering the Market
Claims EKSO has superior technology are not grounded in reality and are likely spread by individuals who have not done extensive work talking to people who actually use products in the market. Not only is EKSO years behind the curve but, now that a few small companies have been "first man over the wall", large global juggernauts with superior R&D teams and endless cash are entering the market with superior products. Even more concerning, EKSO is attempting to spread its tiny R&D budget across multiple end markets, making success against larger and more focused competitors impossible.
Obviously, if EKSO were such a promising company it would not have partnered with jailed fraudster or almost gone bankrupt in 2013 or forced into a sketchy "last resort" reverse merger with a strange penny stock shell. Any company, from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to LMT, could have bought EKSO for pennies at that point and (tellingly) they chose not to. I think EKSO was already behind the technology curve back in 2013 due to financial stress. Once EKSO was forced to effectively put the company on pause for nearly a year and stop paying employees, EKSO effectively died forever at that point and, in this hyper competitive industry against better funded global competitors, crushed any hope of future success.

With this in mind you should not find my following chart comparing the available exoskeleton products surprising. This estimated chart was painstakingly built by talking to multiple people in the industry and digging through countless presentations, and is (unsurprisingly) not something you see in EKSO's paid "analyst reports".

(chart built by me with best effort using publicly available information)
Anyone who wants evidence EKSO is clearly inferior technology see this video and note the lack of assistance for the gentleman on the left, note the speed of walking for RWLK product on the left, the natural gait and clearly superior technology:

(superior RWLK product on the left, pic credit YouTube)
I applaud anyone walking in these suits, but clearly RWLK technology is light years ahead of EKSO's crude offering. We can see here RWLK technology has been capable of going up and down stairs since at least 2011 and is the only suit approved for home use, having been FDA approved almost a year ago now. This RWLK technology superiority is also why RWLK was used by this inspirational patient to complete the London marathon as far back as 2012.


(pic credit ReWalk)
Not only that but RWLK's product list price is $60k as far back as 2013, I don't need to remind you this is nearly HALF of the price EKSO quotes for their device while RWLK's device has ~125k different combinations of personal adjustments, making it far better suited for individual ownership.
RWLK is clearly the leader in home use at the moment as its motors are the strongest and the fastest walking speeds are clocked in this suit. Furthermore, RWLK uses Samina for outsourced manufacturing which will allow it to scale while EKSO is trying to build its suits itself in an old warehouse.
Most importantly, Parker Hannifin's (NYSE:PH) superior Indego product is coming to market in a matter of months, and proves to be both vastly superior and years ahead of anything else available. The lightweight modular design and financing options will allow it to sweep the home market, while the balance sheet of Parker Hannifin and integrated FES therapy will allow it to revolutionize the rehab market. Indego also had variable assist way back in 2012, and RWLK has had partial assistance for a long time as well but EKSO didn't announce this until 2013, with an egregious $20k cost!
For example, we can see below the Indego is thin enough to wear in a wheelchair (GAME):

(pic credit Indego)
Indego also has no big bulky backpack to get in the way like the EKSO suit has.

(pic credit Indego)

Indego's FES functionality is even more revolutionary for the rehab market as Clare Hartigan, MPT at Shepherd Center, elaborates:
"(Indego) Incorporating FES into gait is a huge advantage."
It's not just ReWalk and Indego though as there are literally dozens of companies out in front of EKSO with superior products approved around the globe from Cyberdyne's HAL to many others. Cyberdyne products have been tested in 200 rehab centers in Japan and are in use both in Germany and the US already. Cyberdyne has sold over 350 units and is just getting started where even the prototype was used to carry a paraplegic friend near the top of Swiss Mountain Breithorn. While EKSO is controlled by buttons, Osurus literally has skin implants that read your brain through your skin and nerve endings!

Cyberdyne: Best Hair (and Technology) in Exo-Bionics. No Question.
Meanwhile, Honda (NYSE:HMC) is already leasing 100 of its walking assistance exoskeletons in Japan since 2013. With worker assistance devices in testing as well, and devices already in trials in Chicago.
I could go on and on but you get the picture. The only positive thing I could find about EKSO was that, due to its crude design and limited adjustments, in a rehab clinic setting it is easy to get new patients into the suit fast because the adjustments are limited and simple. Literally everything else is inferior from what I heard and can deduce. Once RWLK rolls out variable assist and Indego rolls out with FES and other superior features and a better sales team, there will be no reason for anyone to buy an EKSO suit.
Lastly, spinal cord injuries are already being cured with stem cells and that technology will relentlessly improve in coming years. Owning EKSO is, in some ways, a bet against stem cells and biotech innovation, which is not a bet any smart investor should make.


(pic credit Google)
If you still honestly think EKSO is a technology leader just look at what Honda (Asimo demo here) and Boston Dynamics' amazing Atlas humanoid robot are capable of. Then watch EKSO's old, unimpressive technology and you will see why no company acquired EKSO back in 2013 before it imploded the first time.
Previous EKSO "Charter Clinics" Now Support Competitors With Superior Products
As further evidence of EKSO failure, we see clinics EKSO previously stated were key partners now endorsing competing products as superior. EKSO previously hyped on past quarterly calls its top "Charter Centers" as key industry supporters, selecting who they felt where the most important centers to work with to be supporters and champions for EKSO.

(pic credit EKSO)
Unfortunately for EKSO, the majority of these centers are now endorsing competitor products. Craig Hospital, CO for example was the clinic to take first delivery of the first EKSO GT suit and was working with Berkeley Bionics and EKSO since at least 2011 but is now a listed partner for Parker Hannifin with Indego.

(pic credit EKSO with my highlights)

We see Indego partners here, while Mount Sinai center uses RWLK for patients as does Spaulding Rehab and TIRR Memorial. Furthermore, RWLK's multi-year head start means RWLK is in 8 of the top 10 clinics in the US already.

(pic credit Shepherd)
Shepherd Center is widely regarded as the single best rehab center in America. It is one of few centers to have used all three available exoskeletons and, tellingly, it is apparently endorsing Indego, the Parker Hannifin product, as the best product available. Pardon the long quote but this is an absolutely critical read:

"Shepherd Center has a world-class reputation in the field of rehabilitation and we are proud they have chosen to support us in the commercialization of Indego," said Craig Maxwell, Vice President of Technology and Innovation for Parker. "Shepherd Center is the only rehabilitation facility to have tested Indego and the two other devices currently being marketed by other companies as exoskeletons."
"We see distinct advantages in Indego, including its lightweight and modular design that promotes independence," said Gary R. Ulicny, Ph.D, President and CEO of Shepherd Center. "From a rehabilitation perspective, we applaud Indego's ability to vary the degree of robotic assistance and the use of electrical stimulation based on the user's level of function."
"the Center has concluded that Indego has the most promise as a device for both rehabilitation and home use."
"Indego is the only robotic exoskeleton that can be worn by a person while in his or her own wheelchair, as well as in a vehicle or even a restaurant booth," said Clare Hartigan, a physical therapist at Shepherd Center who leads the clinical research. "The device can be used for mobility on all surfaces, including stairs."
"We are impressed with how easy Indego is for people to use, as well as its potential to provide compensatory gait for those with motor complete injuries, in addition to its rehabilitative potential for those who are motor incomplete," Hartigan said. "The level of independence Indego offers is unprecedented."


The most shocking aspect of all of this is that the Paker Hannifin Indego product hasn't even been formally released to the market fully yet. It is hitting Europe this summer and should be for sale in US shortly after. As this marketing effort and financing (or rental) terms become formalized this momentum is only expected to increase, and will be devastating for EKSO has inferior technology and who does not have the cash flow necessary to support a rental/lease program.
EKSO Industrial Push: Thinly Veiled Desperation and Failure
I believe it is clear EKSO's pending failure in the rehab market and irrelevance in the personal/home market are why EKSO is now desperately touting the industrial market. Unfortunately, here EKSO is also irrelevant and years behind the curve while competing with impossibly sophisticated and capitalized global manufacturing juggernauts.
In this space it seems we are now seeing products from Panasonic, Boeing (NYSE:BA), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN), Honda, Daewoo and Cyberdyne, among many others entering the able-bodied markets. EKSO has zero hope of success against companies like this.
Panasonic's "Powerloader" for example will be sold at $5k and take 30 seconds to put on. Raytheon just spun out SARCOS, which just got jump started with serious board members and VC backing with obviously superior products here, here and here while the military has stated it is now building its own purpose build Navy device anyway. This whole shift is behind the curve in my view anyway, as helping people hold heavy grinders misses the true mega-trend of robotic manufacturing replacing humans entirely.
Note that EKSO didn't announce its own passive exoskeleton for construction until 12/2014. If the previously touted LMT relationship was going so well why would EKSO do this? Why would EKSO now try to compete with its own partners? Do you honestly believe tiny, underfunded EKSO can out-manufacture Honda, Panasonic, Boeing and Daewoo??
If I need to expand on this later I can, but this will obviously never be a viable business for EKSO and, in my view, is clearly a desperate attempt to have something it can hype to keep the stock from continuing its collapse.

As I look into my time machine I can predict how it seems the disastrous 2015 EKSO movie will play out. I expect into Q4-2015 and especially Q1-2016 EKSO's business will start to nose over bad and failure will be impossible to ignore. At that point, as cash burn accelerates and EKSO becomes increasingly desperate, I believe we need to be wary of increasingly promotional and worthless press releases about vague "partnerships" and even tiny amounts of unprofitable commercial end market revenue. We know EKSO will require cash to survive sometime in Q1 2016 which means it will likely attempt to raise cash in Q4 2015. Since EKSO failed at this last time, I think it will fail again.
EKSO Previous "Go To Market" Strategy Failed and EKSO Facing Impossible Market Dynamics
Even worse, there are tectonic shifts occurring right now in the exo skeleton market, unrelated to technology, which will destroy EKSO.
Tellingly, this last quarter we saw EKSO announce it is shifting its sales strategy towards renting suits. What EKSO investors are missing is this dynamic creates insurmountable balance sheet and cash flow issues for EKSO while also demonstrating customers don't see the value proposition that justifies an outright purchase.
The key issue is if a clinic rents or leases a suit, EKSO is forced to pay cash for the suit up front and hold it in inventory or as an asset. Each one of these suits costs EKSO at least $60k+ of cash up front and as EKSO's operating cash burn is also set to accelerate, will pull forward EKSO's inevitable demise and cash requirement. This working capital dynamic is absolutely critical, as I estimate every 15 suits EKSO tries to rent or lease will require ~$1m of cash use off its balance sheet in addition to -$1.5m per month operating cash burn.
Furthermore, no off balance sheet debt financing partner will finance this. EKSO's suits are rapidly changing and its future value is impossible to ascertain. Furthermore, without EKSO support and maintenance (which would disappear in bankruptcy) those suits are essentially worthless, while EKSO lack of earnings or cash flow certainly cannot support any level of debt.

This is A KEY ADVANTAGE Parker Hannifin has, which is Parker Hannifin can finance suits off its own balance sheet nearly for free with the $2b+ cash Parker has on hand. Furthermore, RWLK is a much more focused company with ~$40m in cash (nearly twice the cash balance of EKSO). This means EKSO is the financially weakest player in the market who is too underfunded to compete and left in an untenable position that cannot be sustained, especially as increased industry competition begins to compress pricing and drive revenue/asp declines.
All of this ignores the fact EKSO is trying to simultaneously work on the very different military, commercial, rehab and individual/home markets all simultaneously. This is also clearly impossible and spreading a very small and vulnerable company far too thin. Given poor management quality at EKSO, I don't find this surprising, and given EKSO's previous go to market strategy seems to have failed, I sense a repeating pattern set to occur.
EKSO Creator Left: Started A Competitor With Superior Products
Undisputed robotics genius Professor Kazerooni was the original founder of EKSO and the one who seems responsible for its technology. He left EKSO and seems to have founded a competing exoskeleton company called US Bionics which has a product coming to market priced at just $15k while looking very effective, lightweight and thin enough to be worn in a wheelchair which Japanese manufacturers apparently already want.

(pic credit US Bionics)
Just to remind you, Kazerooni was the godfather of EKSO and I believe the one responsible for essentially all of EKSO's foundational technology with over 40 patents to his name personally. He built the Berkley Bionics lab from the ground up and put together the team there so very telling I believe that his out and gunning for EKSO now.

If I was going to invest in anything in this space I would invest in US Bionics and genius Kazerooni who, along with ReWalk and Vanderbuilt, are the only people in exo-bionics with a track record of success. The people left in charge of EKSO are a mere shadow of the original team and if EKSO was such an amazing opportunity with an atmosphere of innovation why didn't Kazerooni stay and develop his products inside EKSO?
EKSO Imploding Internally, Employees Flee En-Masse As Cash Burn Accelerates
Management of companies burning through tens of millions of dollars and on the edge of insolvency often blather unrealistic hype. What they often don't discuss is reality.
I believe EKSO's own employees show us that EKSO is imploding internally. Despite only 69 full time employees, I estimate that EKSO has churned through nearly 100 employees in just the past few years. Of these employees we can see the average tenure is estimated at just ~1.5 years!



(chart created by me with public Linkedin Profile info)
Key positions across all EKSO departments including head of sales, marketing, engineering and operations have all experienced shocking levels of turnover with key people leaving in droves. I don't see how a company in such turmoil could possibly be a successful, happy work environment driving innovation or effective sales strategies. EKSO's former VP of Marketing and COO recently both departed for competitor LIM Innovations while Glenn Davis, a highly qualified senior executive from Siemens left EKSO in less than a year.

How can you have a marketing ramp if the Vice President of Marketing, Vice President America's, COO, and Director of EMEA all recently left as the company experiences staggering turn over?
EKSO has had three CEOs just since 2010 as well, from Bruce Borup to Eythor Bender and now Nathan Harding, who has the least management experience of any of them and presided over partnerships with convicted fraudster Gottbetter as well as coming within an inch of bankruptcy. I have less than zero faith in his competence and assume that is why EKSO previously had outside CEOs.
It should be clear to others as well. In March of 2014, EKSO claimed it was at a "key point of growth" even though it furloughed nearly 50% of its workforce in 2013 and then showed virtually flat revenue growth throughout 2014 at less than $6 million of sales.
Also concerning, EKSO has told investors in its 10-K filing it plans to hire 15-20 more employees in the next few months but if you look at the "Careers" section of the EKSO website you will find zero sales positions listed and the page hasn't been updated properly in awhile.
Furthermore, EKSO's current manufacturing capacity is tiny at best and I see no production positions being hired for either? I estimate EKSO's current plant and employee annual manufacturing capacity at just a handful of units per year anyway and, best I can tell, EKSO has never clarified exactly what its current plant and staff annual manufacturing capacity anyway? EKSO management have dodged this question anytime it has been raised, which is a huge red flag in my view, and if I were them I would do what superior peer company RWLK did and fire the entire manufacturing team and outsource production immediately.
EKSO Conflicted Wall Street "Analyst" Models Are Mathematically Impossible
As we've seen with UNIS, NEON, ARNA, KEYW, IWSY and countless cash-burning worthless disasters, the lowest quality Wall Street banks are often blinded by the greed of banking fees. This typically results in what investors call a "Sell Side Promotion" where impossible "estimates" are put forth by bottom tier Wall Street banks in a fight to see who can be most bullish to curry favor from garbage company management teams and secure capital raise fees.

I think EKSO is one of the worst examples of this I've seen. Let's take classic "bank" Ladenburg for example and review the steaming garbage they try to pass off as a financial model.

(credit Ladenburg)
Ignoring the apparently delusional sales estimates, hilariously, Ladenburg's price target assumes zero dilution and completely misses the working capital and cash dynamics explained above.
If EKSO were really going to sell suits on the level Ladenburg fantasizes about, we can run some simple math and see that would require EKSO to raise $252m+ of capital just for inventory and working capital needs! Given EKSO's lack of fraud partner and $185m market cap, these cash needs are obviously impossible. Just factoring in the necessary dilution alone and using Ladenburg's own price target results in a stock price below today's price… doesn't Ladenburg understand basic math?
Another absurd thing I want to point out is Ladenburg are forecasting ASP will actually INCREASE into infinity by +4%. As we have seen, competition is increasing dramatically and EKSO is already overpriced relative to competitive offerings while the company itself has stated it will try and reduce pricing in the future. As we all know, for technology adoption to occur, prices decrease, and we are already seeing that literally right now in the bionics markets.
No real investor is going to buy this garbage and I find it offensive.
Just Stop Already


(pic credit me)
EKSO previously had -$1.3m of monthly cash burn and is guiding to increased hiring while none of its commentary includes the increasing cash use the new exoskeleton lease/rental dynamic will require. In 2014 alone we see EKSO lost -$33.7m and, given the above dynamics we understand now, we can be sure that number is set to increase. Since EKSO only has ~$20m in cash, we can see its previous guidance of survival until q2 2016 is no longer realistic and EKSO will be forced to try and raise more cash much sooner.
Meanwhile EKSO Insiders Pillaging The Company For Millions, Shareholders Get Destroyed by Dilution
Now that we understand EKSO is a financial disaster, created by jailed fraudster Gottbetter and with no hope of commercial success, what are EKSO insiders doing with this worthless mess?

(chart built by me)
Note that insider compensation in 2014 is 300% higher than 2013 and total compensation is nearly what EKSO total 2014 revenue was. How have EKSO insiders and jailed financing partner afforded these egregious payments? By absolutely pillaging their shareholders with an unbelievable amount of dilution.

(chart built by me)
This is a crippling and unsustainable path of shareholder destruction and given everything we've seen here, I'm not surprised EKSO could only raise money with the help of a jailed fraudster and alleged stock price manipulator.
EKSO Cash Burn Increasing, Bankruptcy Inevitable, RWLK Clearly A Superior Choice for Speculation

If you must speculate on exoskeleton stocks, EKSO seems clearly the "worst of the worst". RWLK is a "real company" with credible management, has more product revenue, more market share, is already FDA approved in both home and clinic, has vastly superior technology with a cheaper exo product and is also a cheaper stock given lower $150m market cap with ~$40m in cash, nearly twice the cash EKSO has.
Furthermore, RWLK is covered by real banks like Barclays and Jefferies, which coupled with a real product and real management means it is much better equipped to raise capital. Compare this to EKSO which is intertwined with countless people facing fraud and other allegations and is surrounded by "Banks" like Ladenburg and HC Wainwright.
RWLK has "real", sophisticated, institutional investors supporting the company like Yaskawa Electric and Israel Healthcare while EKSO is largely owned by unsophisticated retail investors and a guy jailed for fraud.
For all these reasons and more, I believe it is obvious why RWLK had a "real" IPO supported by real banks while EKSO was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, with workers furloughed, and forced into a sketchy backdoor reverse-merger while partnering with a jailed fraudster.
If you insist on speculating in small, longshot, bionics companies then RWLK is obviously a better choice and the cheaper stock. If you prefer venture capital or private businesses then US bionics created by the individual responsible for EKSO's original technology is far more exciting with a much higher chance of success.
EKSO Management Non-Response:
Repeated attempts to contact EKSO management in order to clarify the serious issues discusses went unanswered. Furthermore, there appears to be zero way for EKSO stockholders to contact the company they own directly. I view this lack of transparency and shareholder communication to be a huge red flag and urge all EKSO stockholders to directly contact the management team that is in charge of THEIR company immediately. Furthermore, I look forward to public clarification of the many issues at play here as I am very concerned.

EKSO Valuation
EKSO's temporarily stretched valuation of 35x revenue is clearly unsustainable and absurd. I believe this crazy valuation is only possible due to paid stock promotion and confused retail investors. Note EKSO is a manufacturing, medical equipment company which is attempting to produce mechanical equipment in a Richmond warehouse, which is both capital intensive, working capital intensive and not scalable. This is not a software or biotech company that will have huge margins and can grow overnight.
Even hyper growth medical equipment companies with extremely bullish futures are typically valued at ~5x revenue. I think EKSO is clearly a financial disaster and likely to go bankrupt, but in the interest of being optimistic let's assume EKSO is worth what high quality, growing peer medical-equipment companies are valued at.

(chart built by me)
As you can see, even in a "best case" scenario EKSO stock has -84.53% downside right now. However, I think there is a good chance EKSO's coming capital raise fails and EKSO just goes bankrupt in less than 12 months, leaving the stock worthless.
Plungey Battles Stock Market Darkness For Shareholders Everywhere: EKSO Future Price $0.000

(pic credit StarWars and me)
CONCLUSION: EKSO Is Clearly Fundamentally Worthless and Imploding
Any medical patient finding relief or making progress is a brave individual who gets nothing but respect from me and this research has nothing to do with any of you out there. I want to see injured people walk freely more than anyone and some of the companies in this space will make great strides in the future to help people.

This is why I find EKSO with its fraud partnership, paid stock promotion and unrealistic hype to be offensive and distasteful - it is destroying capital at the expense of real companies doing excellent work in the exo-bionics field, and that hurt's all of us. I believe it is obvious now that a sketchy reverse-merger led by people jailed for fraud and facing other allegations, who enrich themselves to the tune of millions, while spending minimal cash on R&D, are not going to be the ones to cure the world's problems.
The kind of true institutional investors required to feed EKSO's $15-20m+ cash burn needs are going to require more than misleading "partnership" press releases and paid stock promotion. It will require real revenue and earnings, neither of which EKSO is capable of generating. This is why EKSO was on "death's door" in 2013, why nobody bought it outright when it almost disappeared and why EKSO has never successfully raised large-scale capital aside from when it partnered with jailed fraudster Gottbetter. Now that he is in prison and unable to finagle money from questionable investment firms while Opaleye is neck deep in EKSO stock and clearly looking to sell, I think EKSO will fail to raise the necessary capital and cease to exist. Not that it matters to insiders though as I imagine they will keep their millions in compensation and any stocks sale proceeds.
I can only speculate on whatever law enforcement investigation EKSO may be facing, and believe EKSO employees show EKSO is imploding as we speak. Fair value indicates minimum -84.51% immediate "best case" downside for EKSO stock and, as the industry continues to move to a lease/rent model which EKSO can't afford while its technological inferiority becomes increasingly apparent, the stock will likely be vaporized in 2016 by bankruptcy, similar to what EKSO experienced in 2013 when it previously failed to raise capital.

Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Ekso Bionics Seeks Acquisitions
Jun 6 17
Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. (NasdaqCM:EKSO) has filed a Shelf Registration in the amount of $75 million. Ekso Bionics said that, "Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement, we intend to use any net proceeds from the sale of securities under this prospectus for our operations and to increase our investments (i) in our clinical, sales and marketing initiatives to accelerate adoption of the Ekso in the rehabilitation market, (ii) in our research, development and commercialization activities with respect to an Ekso robotic exoskeleton for home use, and/or (iii) in the development and commercialization of able-bodied exoskeletons for industrial use, and for other general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, working capital, intellectual property protection and enforcement, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and collaborations."


Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc Develops Lightweight Flexible Exoskeleton Technology Expanding Technical & Intellectual Property Leadership
Jun 5 17
Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. announced that it has completed the development of a lightweight, flexible load carriage exoskeleton prototype named Artemis. The patent-pending prototype weighs a mere 13 pounds and can successfully offload up to three-quarters of payload while also being comfortable to wear. While advancing medical and industrial exoskeleton technology, the company is exploring applying Artemis in their product development pipeline. The intellectual property from this government-funded project will be added to Ekso Bionics's IP portfolio of nearly 200 international patent cases (granted or pending).


Ekso Bionics Plans to Reduce its Workforce by Approximately 25% to Lower Operating Expenses
May 23 17
Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc. announced plans to streamline its operations and reduce its workforce by approximately 25% to lower operating expenses and reduce cash burn. The program intensifies Ekso’s focus on driving commercialization of its proprietary Ekso GT for rehabilitation and its exoskeleton offerings for industrial applications. The company will focus on advancing placements of its Ekso GT so that patients with stroke and spinal cord injuries can achieve better clinical outcomes and improved quality of life. In industrial markets, the Company will work with partners to increase awareness and utilization of Ekso Bionics’ exoskeleton solutions for industrial workers. The company’s R&D efforts will continue to move forward with programs to advance Ekso’s proprietary solutions. The company estimates these cutbacks will result in a 25% reduction in monthly operating expense. One-time cash severance and related expenses are estimated at $1.0 million.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.

Value Score

Momentum Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
