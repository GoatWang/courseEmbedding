While the affected individuals and organizations are struggling with the very tangible business impact of the loss of revenue and operations, it’s critical to step back and review what else one could do to mitigate and minimize the damage from such attacks in...Jul. 26, 2017 06:15 PM EDT  Reads: 421Legacy Modernization: Cloud and Open SystemsBy Astadia CloudGPSIf you are thinking about moving applications off a mainframe and over to open systems and the cloud, consider these guidelines to prioritize what to move and what to eliminate. On the surface, mainframe architecture seems relatively simple: A centrally located computer processes data through an input/output subsystem and stores its computations in memory. At the other end of the mainframe are pri...Jul. 26, 2017 05:00 PM EDT  Reads: 1,312What Business Leaders Need to Know About MLBy William SchmarzoSometimes I write a blog just to formulate and organize a point of view, and I think it’s time that I pull together the bounty of excellent information about Machine Learning. This is a topic with which business leaders must become comfortable, especially tomorrow’s business leaders (tip for my next semester University of San Francisco business students!). Machine learning is a key capability that...Jul. 26, 2017 04:45 PM EDT  Reads: 280Brain Change and Digital StrategiesBy Kevin BenedictThe renowned military strategist John Boyd taught that people and institutions collect favorite philosophies, strategies, theories and ideologies over a period of time, and then try to align the future to fit them.  The problem with this is the future is rarely like the past, and trying to fit new data into old paradigms often forces us to perform irrational mental gymnastics, which leaves us fart...Jul. 26, 2017 04:15 PM EDT  Reads: 293DX and Competitive Decision MakingBy Kevin BenedictThe winning trinity in competitive decision-making includes people, ideas and things according to the renowned military strategist John Boyd. Although competitive decision-making is not yet an Olympic sport, it affects us all.  Leaders (people) must become trained experts at using digital technologies to make fast decisions.  Leaders must use the right strategies and methodologies (ideas) to make ...Jul. 26, 2017 03:56 PM EDT  Reads: 175American Airlines Adopts Public Cloud ComputingBy Kevin JacksonDid you know that the reservations systems of the biggest carriers mostly run on a specialized IBM operating system known as Transaction Processing Facility (TPF).

By Automic BlogWith continuous delivery (CD) almost always in the spotlight, continuous integration (CI) is often left out in the cold. Indeed, it's been in use for so long and so widely, we often take the model for granted. So what is CI and how can you make the most of it? This blog is intended to answer those questions.
Before we step into examining CI, we need to look back. Software developers often work in...Jul. 26, 2017 02:30 PM EDT  Reads: 261[session] Netflix Reinventing the Edge TierBy Elizabeth WhiteThere is a huge demand for responsive, real-time mobile and web experiences, but current architectural patterns do not easily accommodate applications that respond to events in real time. Common solutions using message queues or HTTP long-polling quickly lead to resiliency, scalability and development velocity challenges. In his session at 21st Cloud Expo, Ryland Degnan, a Senior Software Engineer...Jul. 26, 2017 02:15 PM EDT  Reads: 1,272Building & Securing the Workplace of the FutureBy Karyn JefferyFor any business to be successful, it must enable talent to focus on the innovation that will drive new value. As digital literacy and dexterity grows, people are increasingly agnostic about devices – they want to be able to access their personalized workspace and services anywhere, at any time, on any device that happens to be at hand. 
The concept of digital transformation is gathering pace. Wh...Jul. 26, 2017 11:00 AM EDT  Reads: 684Managing Your Hybrid CloudBy Kevin JacksonRunaway cloud computing cost may be causing an information technology industry crisis.  Expanding requirements, extended transition schedules and misleading marketplace hype have made “Transformation” a dirty word.  Questions about how to manage cost variances and deviations with assets and cost across different suppliers abound. A  recent Cloud Tech article explained that while public cloud offer...Jul. 26, 2017 11:00 AM EDT  Reads: 580Is DevOps Falling into the Maturity Trap?By Jason BloombergMany organizations are now looking to DevOps maturity models to gauge their DevOps adoption and compare their maturity to their peers. However, as enterprise organizations rush to adopt DevOps, moving past experimentation to embrace it at scale, they are in danger of falling into the trap that they have fallen into time and time again. 

Unfortunately, we've seen this movie before, and we know h...Jul. 26, 2017 10:00 AM EDT  Reads: 661Is Your Company Ready for the GDPR?By Chris BoormanRemember the Y2K bug, the computer coding flaw that was predicted to cause global havoc when the two-digit dates embedded in software rolled over from 1999 to 2000? After organizations around the world spent a year checking and upgrading their systems to deal with the issue, few major problems ended up occurring.
The world is now on the brink of what could be called the Y2K bug of data privacy – ...Jul. 26, 2017 09:00 AM EDT  Reads: 543DXWorldExpo to “Sponsor” Cloud Expo CASYS-CON Events announced today that DXWorldExpo has been named “Global Sponsor” of SYS-CON's 21st International Cloud Expo, which will take place on Oct 31 – Nov 2, 2017, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, CA.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!
