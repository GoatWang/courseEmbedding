  NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Unaudited)

 




1.



    Description
of Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 10-A, L.P., (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership engaged
primarily in oil and gas development and production in Texas,
Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on February 9, 2010.
The offering of limited and general partner interests began
May 1, 2010 as a part of a private placement pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Regulation D
promulgated thereunder, and concluded August 2, 2010, with
total investor contributions of $73,000,000 originally being sold
to accredited investors of which $67,820,000 were sold to
accredited investors as general partner interests and $5,180,000
were sold to accredited investors as limited partner interests. In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the
Partnership.

 




2.



    Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10 for
2010, which contains a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its financial
statements. These policies are also followed in preparing the
quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

 




3.



    Accounting
for Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At June 30, 2011 approximately $7.2 million of
development in progress capitalized costs were excluded from
amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of
properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses on
the sale or other disposition of properties are not recognized
unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves.
Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that
limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future
net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair
value of unproved properties. There was no cost ceiling write-down
for the three or six months ended June 30, 2011 or
2010.

    Asset
Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests or well plugging and abandonment costs, or if federal or
state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the six months ended
June 30, 2011 and the period from February 9, 2010 (date
of inception) through December 31, 2010 is as
follows:

    Related
Party Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

In
consideration for services rendered by MD in managing the business
of the Partnership, the Partnership during each of the initial
three years of the Partnership will pay to MD a management fee in
the amount equal to .75% of the subscriptions by the investor
partners to the Partnership. The Partnership will include the
management fee as part of the full cost pool pursuant to 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X.

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

Investor Alert:  Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A LP




(Last Updated On: May 23, 2016)Have you suffered investment losses in Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A LP? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.
According to their website, Mewbourne Oil Company develops oil and natural gas prospects, acquires leasehold interests, and serves as the operator in the drilling, completion and production of oil and natural gas wells. The company has focused its efforts on two of this country’s most prolific producing regions, the Anadarko and Permian Basins.
The company often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A LP.  These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%, as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from 1-3%.
The trouble with alternative investment products, like Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A LP, is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.  An additional risk inherent to Mewbourne Oil offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities.
The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A LP.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment recommendation that is made is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Mewbourne Energy Partners 10-A LP or another Mewbourne Oil Reg D private placement investment, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.
