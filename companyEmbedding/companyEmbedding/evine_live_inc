History[edit]
ValueVision[edit]
ValueVision was founded in June 1990 and began broadcasting in 1991.[citation needed]
ShopNBC/HQ[edit]
In 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company.[6] In November of that year, ValueVision was rebranded as ShopNBC, taking on the use of the entertainment enterprise’s peacock and logo.[7]
Reports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in ValueVision, due in part to NBC Universal's pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010,[8] but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company.[9]
ValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ.[5] "Mark Cuban's American Dream" aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts.[10]
Evine[edit]
On February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, Inc. Founded by Russell Nuce and ValueVision CEO Mark Bozek, Dollars Per Minute operated the online shopping service Evine. Bozek felt a rebranding of the shopping service would distance it from its negative consumer perceptions as ShopHQ. Parent company ValueVision also changed its name to Evine Live, Inc.[4] The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com.
EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements), but currently only carries the standard definition signal upscaled, since none of its operations have yet upgraded to the new format. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016.
In July 2016, EVINE Live refreshed its brand to Evine. In addition to dropping “Live” from the brand identity, the company also made minor changes to the brand’s logo.
Former Logos[edit]







Logo for when the network was known as ShopNBC. The logo was used from 2000 to 2009 & the name was retired in 2013.









Logo for when the network was known as ShopHQ from 2013 to 2015.









Evine's Rainbow Box Logo was used from 2015 to 2016. It was used when the network relaunched as Evine Live. This Logo was briefly used when the network became simply known as Evine in 2016.

History[edit]
ValueVision[edit]
ValueVision was founded in June 1990 and began broadcasting in 1991.[citation needed]
ShopNBC/HQ[edit]
In 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company.[6] In November of that year, ValueVision was rebranded as ShopNBC, taking on the use of the entertainment enterprise’s peacock and logo.[7]
Reports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in ValueVision, due in part to NBC Universal's pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010,[8] but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company.[9]
ValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ.[5] "Mark Cuban's American Dream" aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts.[10]
Evine[edit]
On February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, Inc. Founded by Russell Nuce and ValueVision CEO Mark Bozek, Dollars Per Minute operated the online shopping service Evine. Bozek felt a rebranding of the shopping service would distance it from its negative consumer perceptions as ShopHQ. Parent company ValueVision also changed its name to Evine Live, Inc.[4] The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com.
EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements), but currently only carries the standard definition signal upscaled, since none of its operations have yet upgraded to the new format. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016.
In July 2016, EVINE Live refreshed its brand to Evine. In addition to dropping “Live” from the brand identity, the company also made minor changes to the brand’s logo.
Former Logos[edit]







Logo for when the network was known as ShopNBC. The logo was used from 2000 to 2009 & the name was retired in 2013.









Logo for when the network was known as ShopHQ from 2013 to 2015.









Evine's Rainbow Box Logo was used from 2015 to 2016. It was used when the network relaunched as Evine Live. This Logo was briefly used when the network became simply known as Evine in 2016.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Company expects to invest approximately $8 million in capital expenditures weighted heavier in the first half of the year related to company transition to HDTV.

History[edit]
ValueVision[edit]
ValueVision was founded in June 1990 and began broadcasting in 1991.[citation needed]
ShopNBC/HQ[edit]
In 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company.[6] In November of that year, ValueVision was rebranded as ShopNBC, taking on the use of the entertainment enterprise’s peacock and logo.[7]
Reports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in ValueVision, due in part to NBC Universal's pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010,[8] but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company.[9]
ValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ.[5] "Mark Cuban's American Dream" aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts.[10]
Evine[edit]
On February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, Inc. Founded by Russell Nuce and ValueVision CEO Mark Bozek, Dollars Per Minute operated the online shopping service Evine. Bozek felt a rebranding of the shopping service would distance it from its negative consumer perceptions as ShopHQ. Parent company ValueVision also changed its name to Evine Live, Inc.[4] The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com.
EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements), but currently only carries the standard definition signal upscaled, since none of its operations have yet upgraded to the new format. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016.
In July 2016, EVINE Live refreshed its brand to Evine. In addition to dropping “Live” from the brand identity, the company also made minor changes to the brand’s logo.
Former Logos[edit]







Logo for when the network was known as ShopNBC. The logo was used from 2000 to 2009 & the name was retired in 2013.









Logo for when the network was known as ShopHQ from 2013 to 2015.









Evine's Rainbow Box Logo was used from 2015 to 2016. It was used when the network relaunched as Evine Live. This Logo was briefly used when the network became simply known as Evine in 2016.

About the Collection

About the Collection
Innovation. That single word characterizes Invicta perfectly. No other watch company brings more exciting new styles to market faster than Invicta. With a flair for the bold, Invicta designs transcend the obvious into a world of endless possibilities.

Invicta is always one step ahead of the competition, leading the way with timepieces and features that go far beyond the mere tracking of time and date.  Smart style, meticulous detail and superior craftsmanship define every Invicta watch.  With a wide range of styles and prices, Invicta luxury watches are within reach for every consumer.

Invicta was originally founded in 1837 with the belief that high quality, luxury timepieces and affordable pricing did not have to be mutually exclusive. After recognizing a need in the modern market, Invicta CEO Eyal Lalo reintroduced the brand in 1991. By staying true to its 150- year-old originating principle, Invicta has since become an innovative leader praised by industry experts, valued by savvy consumers, and adored by discerning collectors.

Invicta Watches
Invicta watches at Evine give you the confidence and charisma needed to take charge of your appearance and master time management. Created for world explorers, adventurers, and experience-seekers, the official Invicta watch collection is home to the finest in diving and sport watches on the market. These highly praised timepieces are not only produced to exceed the highest standards in artisanship, but they are also chic enough to feature in the boardroom.
Currently based in the USA, Raphael Picard founded the Invicta watch company in 1837 in La Chaux-de-fonds, Switzerland. His collection of automatic winding Swiss designs was of exceptional beauty and construction, yet Picard resolved to offer them at modest prices for the everyman to afford. To this day, President and CEO of the Invicta Watch Group, Eyal Lalo, upholds that radical school of thought. Lalo is a third-generation horologist and true maverick within the watch-making business.

History[edit]
ValueVision[edit]
ValueVision was founded in June 1990 and began broadcasting in 1991.[citation needed]
ShopNBC/HQ[edit]
In 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company.[6] In November of that year, ValueVision was rebranded as ShopNBC, taking on the use of the entertainment enterprise’s peacock and logo.[7]
Reports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in ValueVision, due in part to NBC Universal's pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010,[8] but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company.[9]
ValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ.[5] "Mark Cuban's American Dream" aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts.[10]
Evine[edit]
On February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, Inc. Founded by Russell Nuce and ValueVision CEO Mark Bozek, Dollars Per Minute operated the online shopping service Evine. Bozek felt a rebranding of the shopping service would distance it from its negative consumer perceptions as ShopHQ. Parent company ValueVision also changed its name to Evine Live, Inc.[4] The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com.
EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements), but currently only carries the standard definition signal upscaled, since none of its operations have yet upgraded to the new format. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016.
In July 2016, EVINE Live refreshed its brand to Evine. In addition to dropping “Live” from the brand identity, the company also made minor changes to the brand’s logo.
Former Logos[edit]







Logo for when the network was known as ShopNBC. The logo was used from 2000 to 2009 & the name was retired in 2013.









Logo for when the network was known as ShopHQ from 2013 to 2015.









Evine's Rainbow Box Logo was used from 2015 to 2016. It was used when the network relaunched as Evine Live. This Logo was briefly used when the network became simply known as Evine in 2016.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Evine has received 3.78 out of 5 stars based on 89 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

History[edit]
ValueVision[edit]
ValueVision was founded in June 1990 and began broadcasting in 1991.[citation needed]
ShopNBC/HQ[edit]
In 2000, NBC purchased a share of the company.[6] In November of that year, ValueVision was rebranded as ShopNBC, taking on the use of the entertainment enterprise’s peacock and logo.[7]
Reports surfaced in 2010 stating NBC would sell its stake in ValueVision, due in part to NBC Universal's pending merger with Comcast. NBCUniversal formally announced that it would sell its stake back to ValueVision Media in May 2010,[8] but ultimately decided in June 2010 to retain its stake in the company.[9]
ValueVision acquired NBCUniversal's financial stake in the company in 2013, and announced the network would be renamed ShopHQ.[5] "Mark Cuban's American Dream" aired on the network in 2014, and was part of a plan under the Clinton Group management to feature more celebrity hosts.[10]
Evine[edit]
On February 13, 2015, the ShopHQ network was rebranded as EVINE Live, following ValueVision Media's acquisition of e-commerce company Dollars Per Minute, Inc. Founded by Russell Nuce and ValueVision CEO Mark Bozek, Dollars Per Minute operated the online shopping service Evine. Bozek felt a rebranding of the shopping service would distance it from its negative consumer perceptions as ShopHQ. Parent company ValueVision also changed its name to Evine Live, Inc.[4] The network hired former QVC host Kathy Levine, and has featured merchandise branded under different reality TV stars, including Lisa Vanderpump and Countess Luann DeLesseps. It also sells products on its e-commerce website, Evine.com.
EVINE Live launched a high definition feed of the channel in 1080i (including the acquisition of HD tier channel slots under new carriage agreements), but currently only carries the standard definition signal upscaled, since none of its operations have yet upgraded to the new format. The network converted to an upscaled standard definition widescreen presentation in the fall of 2016.
In July 2016, EVINE Live refreshed its brand to Evine. In addition to dropping “Live” from the brand identity, the company also made minor changes to the brand’s logo.
Former Logos[edit]







Logo for when the network was known as ShopNBC. The logo was used from 2000 to 2009 & the name was retired in 2013.









Logo for when the network was known as ShopHQ from 2013 to 2015.









Evine's Rainbow Box Logo was used from 2015 to 2016. It was used when the network relaunched as Evine Live. This Logo was briefly used when the network became simply known as Evine in 2016.

For nearly 30 years, Bob has inspired homeowners and do-it-yourselfers and shown them the satisfaction of making an old house new again. I’m excited for him to spark that same inspiration in our customers,” said Bob Rosenblatt, Chief Executive Officer of Evine. “Bringing his combination of knowledge and experience to Evine, Bob has curated a unique assortment of DIY products that go far beyond the basic ‘hammer and screwdriver.’ This collection comes at a perfect time for all those summer home projects.” “My entire career has been devoted to home improvement, and I’m thrilled to share what I’ve learned with Evine’s viewers,” said Bob Vila. “Every product I’ve created is meant to solve a problem… and these are products you won’t find at your local hardware store. I think everyone from seasoned handymen to weekend DIYers will love what we’ve designed. These are items no household should be without.” Vila has spent his decades-long career helping people upgrade their homes and improve their lives.

In hosting Bob Vila’s Home Again, Bob Vila, and Restore America with Bob Vila, Bob taught millions of people how good design, and often sweat equity, play in creating the surroundings you love. Bob also played himself in guest appearances on Tim Allen’s Home Improvement sitcom. In addition to teaching through TV, Bob is the author of 12 books, including Bob Vila’s Toolbox. Today, Bob is breaking new ground on the Web with a fast-growing website, BobVila.com. The site has Bob’s complete TV library, as well as a rich trove of exclusive original online content. From inspirational galleries, to how-to articles, to suggestions on the products to buy, the site covers the entire home improvement journey. Bob takes his home improvement advice into the social realm, with 1.5 Million+ Twitter followers, Facebook fans, and Pinterest followers. In the last five years, Bob has channeled his passion for renovation into helping with the restoration of Ernest Hemingway’s home and collections at Finca Vigía, near Havana, Cuba.
