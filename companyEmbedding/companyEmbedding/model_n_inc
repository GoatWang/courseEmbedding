History[edit]
In 2004, the company added a Medicaid Claims Processing application to its Revenue Management Suite main product, making it the "first Medicaid solution integrated with commercial revenue management".[4]
In the spring of 2006, Model N completed an acquisition of Azerity, a software company that focused on pricing and quoting practices for the high tech industry. Due to this acquisition, Model N serves high tech customers such as ON Semiconductor and Dell. In early 2012, Model N acquired LeapFrogRX, an analytics company based in Waltham, Massachusetts.
In 2013, the company went public under the New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol MODN, raising about US$100,000,000.[2][5] Venture capital firm Accel-KKR backed the initial public offering.[2]
In November of 2013, Model N released CPQ (Configure Price Quote) software known as REVVY CPQ.
As of 2014[update], customers of Model N include Merck, Amgen, Johnson & Johnson among pharmaceutical companies; and Dell, Nokia and VMware among technology companies.[1] Model N is also a provider of revenue management solutions for about 1 in 5 semiconductor companies globally.[6]
Corporate governance[edit]
Model N's founder and executive chairman is Zack Rinat.[3] In 2016, Edward Sander was announced as chief executive officer (CEO), replacing Rinat.[7] In 2014, Mark Tisdel and Shail Khiyara were appointed to the posts of chief financial officer (CFO) and chief marketing officer (CMO), respectively.[3] Tisdel replaces CFO Sujan Jain.[3] As of 2014[update], Charles Robel is the company's lead director, and Sarah Friar is among the directors.[3]
Zack Rinat[edit]
Zack Rinat was born around 1959 and has served as a commander in the "Israeli special-forces".[1][notes 1] Prior to founding Model N, Rinat co-founded the software company NetDynamics, which was purchased by Sun Microsystems in 1998.[1]
