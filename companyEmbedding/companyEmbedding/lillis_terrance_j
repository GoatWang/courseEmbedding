Terrence (Terry) J. Dee focuses his practice on product liability, class action, trade secrets, and other complex litigation. He has tried cases in federal and state courts throughout the country, including Illinois, Ohio, Washington, DC, Maryland, Arizona and Missouri, and has handled numerous commercial arbitrations. Terry has also served as coordinating or liaison counsel in several multi-district litigation matters, developing the national strategy and coordinating the joint defense of those cases. He has represented corporations and individuals in post-closing disputes, non-competition, and US Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and securities matters.
Terry clerked for US District Judge Howard F. Sachs in the US District Court for the Western District of Missouri from 1992 to 1994.

Served as lead trial counsel for a client and joint defense group in a multi-district litigation in the US District Court for the Central District of California in which plaintiffs filed more than 25 consumer-fraud class actions throughout the country alleging that Bluetooth headsets cause hearing loss; successfully settled the action on a class-wide basis and argued the appeal of the settlement before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
Served as lead trial counsel in a multi-district litigation in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in which plaintiffs filed several purported consumer-fraud class actions throughout the country alleging wireless phones do not comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) 911 call processing regulations, and was also selected as liaison counsel for national defense of more than 15 wireless industry companies; successfully argued summary judgment motion leading to the dismissal of all cases
Served as lead trial counsel for a client and a joint defense group in multi-district litigation in the US District Court for the District of Maryland in which plaintiffs filed several purported consumer-fraud and breach-of-warranty class actions claiming that defendants failed to disclose that cell phones caused adverse health effects; successfully argued for dismissal of the cases based on federal preemption and, in related litigation, successfully argued for the dismissal of a purported class action in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania based on federal preemption, which was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
Served as lead trial counsel for the largest privately owned coal company in the United States in a multi-jurisdiction dispute over a competitor's breach of non-disclosure agreement and misappropriation of trade secrets
Served as lead trial counsel in a several-week arbitration representing a buyer in post-closing disputes related to breaches of warranties and covenants in the sale of a consumer goods packaging business; a three-arbitrator panel issued an award granting full relief to our client
Led defense and co-tried multi-day NYSE arbitration involving a major investment bank and one of its top brokers, involving claims of unsuitable investment recommendations, misrepresentations and failure to supervise; obtained a complete defense verdict and successfully had the claim expunged from the broker's record
Served as lead trial counsel in a preliminary injunction hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in a non-competition, misappropriation of trade secrets case involving the outsourcing industry; successfully negotiated a post-hearing settlement
Represented an industry trade group in making First Amendment and preemption challenges to the City of San Francisco and City of Berkeley ordinances requiring certain point-of-sale disclosures

When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not.

Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
