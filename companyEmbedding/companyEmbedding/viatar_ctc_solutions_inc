					Full Description



Viatar CTC Solutions Inc., formerly Vizio Medical Devices LLC, incorporated on December 18, 2007, is a medical technology company. The Company is focused on developing and marketing products to collect cancer cells for molecular diagnostics by others and as cancer therapy, both of which are based on the principle of removing blood-borne circulating tumor cells (CTCs). These CTCs detach from solid tumors and enter the bloodstream carrying the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of the tumor and seeding new tumors. The Company is seeking to commercialize over two products, which utilizes its CTC removal technology, including Viatar Collection System for Molecular Analysis and Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System.The Viatar Collection System for Molecular Analysis is designed to collect and purify a quantity of CTCs from approximately 50 milliliters of blood as the front end for DNA sequencing and other genetic analysis technologies used primarily for research. The Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System is designed to remove CTCs from a patient's blood as a cancer therapy for metastatic disease. The initial focus will be breast, colon or prostate cancer patients who have metastatic tumors and are refractory to the standard of care chemotherapy or targeted therapy treatment. The Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System seeks to reduce the tumor burden by the wholesale removal of CTCs through size-based filtration (similar to removal of toxins by dialysis). The Viatar Collection System for Molecular Analysis product consists of a small, bench top base unit (pumps, hardware and control system) and a single use fluid circuit. It is designed for use in a laboratory setting at a hospital, research lab or outpatient oncology clinic. The output from its product will be a tube or slide containing CTCs suitable for DNA amplification and sequencing, or analysis by all other companies CTC technology platforms. The Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System consists of a small base unit (pumps, hardware and control system) and an extracorporeal fluid circuit that is connected to a cancer patient's central venous system. A treatment session will take approximately four hours, during which time the patient's blood is circulated through its size-based filter.The Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System utilizes mechanical filtration of blood as the therapy to remove CTCs, and a dosage regimen that will be determined through human clinical trials to maintain the absolute number of CTCs in the safe zone, which delimits the probability of favorable survival. Its cross-flow filtration technology exploits the differential size and deformability properties between CTCs and normal blood components. The Company's filter consists of a micro-machined polymer that allows the passage of approximately 50 million red blood cells (RBCs), platelets and white blood cells (WBCs) per second, while retaining viable CTCs for downstream analysis. The Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System is designed for use in a chemotherapy, dialysis or apheresis clinic in a hospital or outpatient setting by nurses or technicians who are trained to administer infusion, dialysis or apheresis treatments. It intends to market and sell the Viatar Therapeutic Oncopheresis System on a direct basis through its own sales force in markets (such as the United States, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Japan), and through distributors in other markets.The Company competes with Johnson & Johnsons, Atossa Genetics, Alere, Illumina, Apocell, EPIC Sciences, Clearbridge Biomedics, Cynvenio Biosystems, Fluxion Biosciences, RareCells, ScreenCell, Silicon Biosystems, Pfizer Inc., Abbott Laboratories, Inc., Daiichi-Sankyo, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, bioMerieux, Dako A/S, Biodesix, Caris, Clarient, Foundation Medicine, Response Genetics, Neogenomics, Agendia, Genomic Health, Genoptix Sonic USA, Quest and LabCorp.
