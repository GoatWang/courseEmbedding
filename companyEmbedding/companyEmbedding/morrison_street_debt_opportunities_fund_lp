Calls with the company may be monitored and recorded for quality assurance and training purposes.
Completing a form on this site does not enroll you into a debt settlement program. If you do enter into a debt settlement program with Guardian, your program may last 24 to 48 months. Clients who are enrolled in a debt settlement program may realize savings at the completion of the program including applicable fees. These figures are based on enrolled unsecured debts, and may vary depending on your individual debt settlement program. Completion rate of the program is not guaranteed, and is based on the client’s ability to make timely monthly payments. There is no guarantee that we will lower your debt by either amount or percentage, or that you will be debt-free at any set time. We do not make monthly payments to creditors, take on consumer debt, nor do we provide credit repair services, or bankruptcy, tax, legal, or accounting advice. Contact a tax professional for tax advice and consequences of debt settlement. Contact a lawyer to discuss bankruptcy options. Our debt settlement services are not available in all states. Depending on your location, we may be able to recommend tax professionals or attorneys to assist you. Any use of the term “debt-free” or “debt freedom” on this site or by any Guardian representative, refers only to unsecured debt enrolled in our debt settlement program—and does not relate to or promise any relief from secured debt and/or unsecured debt not enrolled in a debt settlement program. Please understand the benefits and consequences of enrolling in any debt settlement program, including potential negative credit rating impacts.

Calls with the company may be monitored and recorded for quality assurance and training purposes.
Completing a form on this site does not enroll you into a debt settlement program. If you do enter into a debt settlement program with Guardian, your program may last 24 to 48 months. Clients who are enrolled in a debt settlement program may realize savings at the completion of the program including applicable fees. These figures are based on enrolled unsecured debts, and may vary depending on your individual debt settlement program. Completion rate of the program is not guaranteed, and is based on the client’s ability to make timely monthly payments. There is no guarantee that we will lower your debt by either amount or percentage, or that you will be debt-free at any set time. We do not make monthly payments to creditors, take on consumer debt, nor do we provide credit repair services, or bankruptcy, tax, legal, or accounting advice. Contact a tax professional for tax advice and consequences of debt settlement. Contact a lawyer to discuss bankruptcy options. Our debt settlement services are not available in all states. Depending on your location, we may be able to recommend tax professionals or attorneys to assist you. Any use of the term “debt-free” or “debt freedom” on this site or by any Guardian representative, refers only to unsecured debt enrolled in our debt settlement program—and does not relate to or promise any relief from secured debt and/or unsecured debt not enrolled in a debt settlement program. Please understand the benefits and consequences of enrolling in any debt settlement program, including potential negative credit rating impacts.
