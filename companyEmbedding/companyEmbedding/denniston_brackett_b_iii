When he first became GC, the company was using 450 outside firms. However, he didn't think they were employed often enough to develop a strong feel for GE's products and needs. Today, only 108 firms get the majority of GE's business.Copyright: Attribution Non-Commercial (BY-NC)Download as PDF, TXT or read online from ScribdFlag for inappropriate content

BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Global 50 law firm Goodwin announced today that Brackett B. Denniston 
      III, who led General Electric’s renowned legal organization for more 
      than a decade, has returned to Goodwin, where he began his legal 
      practice as an associate and, later, was named partner. Denniston 
      rejoins Goodwin as senior counsel, based in the firm’s Boston office.
    


      “Brackett is one of the most highly regarded GCs of his generation and 
      we are thrilled to welcome him back to Goodwin,” said David 
      M. Hashmall, Goodwin’s Chairman. “His longstanding commitments to 
      client service, pro bono and diversity align with Goodwin’s culture and 
      values, and his extensive senior leadership experience, in both the 
      public and private sectors, will be of enormous value to our clients.”
    

      “I am delighted to return to Goodwin, a place that was instrumental in 
      teaching me how to lawyer and which I loved,” said Denniston. “I look 
      forward to working on the issues about which I have been deeply 
      passionate throughout my career.”
    

      Denniston joined General Electric in 1996 as Vice President and Senior 
      Counsel of Litigation and Legal Policy. He was named General Counsel in 
      2004 and Senior Vice President in 2005, and served in these roles for 
      more than a decade, leading a global legal, environmental and safety, 
      and government affairs team of more than 3,000 professionals worldwide. 
      His tenure leading GE’s legal operations has been widely praised, 
      especially his team’s work in the areas of compliance, corporate 
      governance, IP protection, dispute resolution, government affairs, pro 
      bono and diversity. During his time at GE, it was named best legal 
      department by Corporate Counsel magazine and he was named among 
      the most influential lawyers by the National Law Journal.
    

      Prior to joining GE, Denniston served as Chief Legal Counsel for 
      Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld for three years. His public 
      sector work also includes service from 1982-1986 as Chief of the Major 
      Frauds Unit in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of 
      Massachusetts, where he led prosecutions relating to securities and 
      financial fraud. He was awarded the Department of Justice’s Director’s 
      Award for Superior Performance for his role overseeing numerous 
      successful prosecutions.
    

      Denniston was a partner at Goodwin from 1986-1993, and also practiced as 
      an associate at the firm from 1974-1982, where he focused on complex 
      civil litigation, securities matters and white collar crime cases. He 
      began his legal career as a law clerk for Judge Herbert Y. C. Choy of 
      the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit after 
      graduating magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was 
      an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He earned his undergraduate 
      degree summa cum laude from Kenyon College.
    

      Denniston is Chair of the Board of Kenyon College, Chair of the 
      Institute for Legal Reform of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member 
      of the Chamber’s board and Executive Committee, and a board member of 
      Transparency International (US), Equal Justice Rights and the Pro Bono 
      Partnership.

Former General Electric General Counsel Brackett Denniston Returns to Goodwin


 Global 50 law firm Goodwin announced today that Brackett B. Denniston 
 III, who led General Electric's renowned legal organization for more 
 than a decade, has returned to Goodwin, where he began his legal 
 practice as an associate and, later, was named partner. Denniston 
 rejoins Goodwin as senior counsel, based in the firm's Boston office.

 "Brackett is one of the most highly regarded GCs of his generation and 
 we are thrilled to welcome him back to Goodwin," said David 
 M. Hashmall, Goodwin's Chairman. "His longstanding commitments to 
 client service, pro bono and diversity align with Goodwin's culture and 
 values, and his extensive senior leadership experience, in both the 
 public and private sectors, will be of enormous value to our clients."
 

 "I am delighted to return to Goodwin, a place that was instrumental in 
 teaching me how to lawyer and which I loved," said Denniston. "I look 
 forward to working on the issues about which I have been deeply 
 passionate throughout my career."
 

 Denniston joined General Electric in 1996 as VicePresident and Senior 
 Counsel of Litigation and Legal Policy. He was named General Counsel in 
 2004 and Senior Vice President in 2005, and served in these roles for 
 more than a decade, leading a global legal, environmental and safety, 
 and government affairs team of more than 3,000 professionals worldwide. 
 His tenure leading GE's legal operations has been widely praised, 
 especially his team's work in the areas of compliance, corporate 
 governance, IP protection, dispute resolution, government affairs, pro 
 bono and diversity. During his time at GE, it was named best legal 
 department by Corporate Counsel magazine and he was named among 
 the most influential lawyers by the National Law Journal.
 




 Prior to joining GE, Denniston served as Chief Legal Counsel for 
 Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld for three years. His public 
 sector work also includes service from 1982-1986 as Chief of the Major 
 Frauds Unit in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of 
 Massachusetts, where he led prosecutions relating to securities and 
 financial fraud. He was awarded the Department of Justice's Director's 
 Award for Superior Performance for his role overseeing numerous 
 successful prosecutions.
 

 Denniston was a partner at Goodwin from 1986-1993, and also practiced as 
 an associate at the firm from 1974-1982, where he focused on complex 
 civil litigation, securities matters and white collar crime cases. He 
 began his legal career as a law clerk for Judge Herbert Y. C. Choy of 
 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit after 
 graduating magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where he was 
 an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He earned his undergraduate 
 degree summa cum laude from Kenyon College.
 

 Denniston is Chair of the Board of Kenyon College, Chair of the 
 Institute for Legal Reform of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member 
 of the Chamber's board and Executive Committee, and a board member of 
 Transparency International (US), Equal Justice Rights and the Pro Bono 
 Partnership.
 

 He may be reached at 617-570-1520 or bdenniston@goodwinlaw.com.
