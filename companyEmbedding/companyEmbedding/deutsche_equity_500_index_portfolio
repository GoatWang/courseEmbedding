    R-1718-6 (12/16) Additional Performance InformationFund performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. * On 10/20/06 Investment Class shares were renamed as Class S shares. See the prospectus for details.Important Objectives, Strategy and Risk InformationThe fund seeks to replicate, as closely as possible, before the deduction of expenses, the performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index (S&P 500), which emphasizes stocks of large US companies.The fund seeks to replicate, before expenses, the risk and return characteristics of the S&P 500 Index, through investments in common stocks of companies that make up the Index, in approximately the same weightings as the index. (The S&P 500 Index tracks the performance of 500 leading U.S. stocks and is widely considered representative of the U.S. equity market.) The fund’s portfolio management team uses quantitative analysis techniques to structure the fund to obtain a high correlation to the S&P 500 Index. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Various factors, including costs, cash flows and security selection, may cause the fund’s performance to differ from that of the index. The fund may lend securities to approved institutions. Stocks may decline in value. See the prospectus for details.Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Morningstar® Equity Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s valuation relative to the appropriate peer group, as well as the size of the companies in which it invests, or median market capitalization. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar® category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar® category is estimated.Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Morningstar® International Equity Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow ratios relative to the MSCI EAFE® index, as well as the size of the companies in which it invests, or median market capitalization. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar category is estimated.Morningstar Risk is based on the calculation of the difference between the Morningstar Return (adjusted for loads and excess over the risk-free rate) and the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return (adjusted for loads, excess over risk-free rate and risk). The calculation results in a rating system such that for each time period (3-, 5-, 10-years), the top 10% are given a risk score of 5 or High, next 22.5% of 4 or Above Average, next 35% of 3 or Average, next 22.5% of 2 or Below Average and the bottom 10% of 1 or Low. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Beta is a historical measure of a fund’s sensitivity to the movements of the fund’s benchmark index. A fund with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the benchmark. A fund with a beta less than 1 is less volatile. Source: Morningstar, Inc. R-squared (R2) is a historical measure that indicates how closely a fund’s past fluctuations have correlated with those of the fund’s benchmark. An R2 of 100% means that all movements of a fund are explained by benchmark movements. Both beta and R2 are based on a 3-year period relative to the index. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Standard deviation is a 3-year statistical measure of the volatility of a fund’s returns. Generally, the greater the standard deviation, the greater the fund’s volatility. Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Price/Earnings Ratio, or P/E Ratio, is a stock’s current price divided by the company’s trailing 12-month earnings per share from continuous operations.Source: Morningstar, Inc. Turnover rate is the rate of trading activity in a fund’s portfolio of investments, equal to the lesser of purchases or sales, for a year, divided by average total assets for that year.

Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Morningstar® Equity Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s valuation relative to the appropriate peer group, as well as the size of the companies in which it invests, or median market capitalization. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar® category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar® category is estimated.Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Morningstar® International Equity Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow ratios relative to the MSCI EAFE® index, as well as the size of the companies in which it invests, or median market capitalization. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar category is estimated.Morningstar Risk is based on the calculation of the difference between the Morningstar Return (adjusted for loads and excess over the risk-free rate) and the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return (adjusted for loads, excess over risk-free rate and risk). The calculation results in a rating system such that for each time period (3-, 5-, 10-years), the top 10% are given a risk score of 5 or High, next 22.5% of 4 or Above Average, next 35% of 3 or Average, next 22.5% of 2 or Below Average and the bottom 10% of 1 or Low. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Beta is a historical measure of a fund’s sensitivity to the movements of the fund’s benchmark index. A fund with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the benchmark. A fund with a beta less than 1 is less volatile. Source: Morningstar, Inc. R-squared (R2) is a historical measure that indicates how closely a fund’s past fluctuations have correlated with those of the fund’s benchmark. An R2 of 100% means that all movements of a fund are explained by benchmark movements. Both beta and R2 are based on a 3-year period relative to the index. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Standard deviation is a 3-year statistical measure of the volatility of a fund’s returns. Generally, the greater the standard deviation, the greater the fund’s volatility. Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Price/Earnings Ratio, or P/E Ratio, is a stock’s current price divided by the company’s trailing 12-month earnings per share from continuous operations.Source: Morningstar, Inc. Turnover rate is the rate of trading activity in a fund’s portfolio of investments, equal to the lesser of purchases or sales, for a year, divided by average total assets for that year.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 4/30/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.
3. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
