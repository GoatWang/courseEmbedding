Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. The Fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decision-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. The Fund is a “non-diversified” investment company and therefore may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a limited number of issuers than funds that are “diversified.” Accordingly, the Fund is more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund might be. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks.
The Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and other expenses must be considered carefully before investing. You can obtain the Fund's most recent periodic reports and certain other regulatory filings by calling 1(877)354-6311 / 1(877)DLINE11, or Clicking here. You should read these reports and other filings carefully before investing.For our Funds that are no-load mutual funds, management fees and other expenses will apply. Please refer to the prospectus for further details.

Income Solutions Fund
Investment Objective
The Fund’s investment objective is to provide a high level of current income and its secondary objective is to seek capital appreciation.
Philosophy
The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. The Fund may invest in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets. The Fund’s investment advisor, DoubleLine Capital LP (“DoubleLine” or the “Advisor”), allocates the Fund’s assets among debt security market sectors, and among investments within those sectors, in an attempt to construct a portfolio providing the potential for a high level of current income and for capital appreciation consistent with what DoubleLine considers an appropriate level of risk in light of market conditions prevailing at the time.

The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is a non-diversified fund designed primarily as a long-term investment and not as a trading tool. The Fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Due to the uncertainty in all investments, there can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or that you may lose part or all of your investment. The values of securities held by the Fund may move up or down, sometime rapidly and unpredictably. Your common shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment, even after taking into account any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Closed-end funds (CEF) do not continuously offer shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. The shares trade on a secondary market after the initial public offering. Investor who wish to buy or sell fund shares of a CEF need to place order through an intermediary, or broker, who will buy or sell fund shares on the stock exchange in a process identical to the purchase or sale of any other listed stock. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market value. Additional risks and uncertainties may also adversely affect and impair the Fund. This Web site is for information purposes only and is not intended as a solicitation to sell or buy any security.

This news release is not for tax reporting purposes. The release has been issued to announce the amount and timing of the distributions declared by the Board of Trustees. There is a possibility that distributions may include ordinary income, long-term capital gains or return of capital. The amount of distributable income and the tax characteristics of the distributions are determined at the end of the taxable year. In early 2018, the Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV specifying how the distributions paid by the Fund during the prior calendar year should be characterized for purposes of reporting the distributions on a shareholder's tax return.

There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Investing in the Fund involves the risk of principal loss.

Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering. There are risks associated with an investment in the Fund. 
To read about the DoubleLine Opportunistic Credit Fund (DBL), please access the Annual Report at www.doublelinefunds.com or call 888.308.3838 to receive a copy. Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. An investment in the Fund should not constitute a complete investment program.
This document is not an offer to sell securities or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities, nor shall there be any sale or offer of these securities, in any jurisdiction where such sale or offer is not permitted.
Fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value, which may increase investors' risk of loss.  This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after the completion of the public offering.  There are risks associated with investment in the fund.
Investments in debt securities typically decline in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include additional risks that investors should be aware of including credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, as well as increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments. 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund may invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. Investments in lower rated and non-rated securities present a great risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. Investment strategies may not achieve the desired results due to implementation lag, other timing factors, portfolio management decisions-making, economic or market conditions or other unanticipated factors. In addition, the Fund may invest in other asset classes and investments such as, among others, REITs, credit default swaps, short sales, derivatives and smaller companies which include additional risks.

Fixed Income Asset AllocationDescriptionBenchmarkCore Plus Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return through active asset allocation across fixed income sectors. Active asset allocation is paramount in our efforts to mitigate risk and achieve better risk-adjusted returns. The strategy can be more or less aggressive per client mandate.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexFlexible IncomeSeeks long term absolute return, high current income and capital appreciation through active asset allocation across global fixed income sectors using duration management based on the manager's view of, among other things, future interest rates and market conditions. Duration can vary from 3 to 10 yearsBenchmark: Not managed to a specific benchmark. Targets Libor +250 basis pointsLong Duration Total ReturnSeeks long-term total return through active asset allocation using the traditional Liability Driven Investing (LDI) asset classes, U.S. Government and U.S. Corporate securities, but differentiates itself by adding long-term agency mortgages to that mix. The advantage to adding mortgages is to potentially add alpha with lower volatility and higher credit quality in comparison to corporate bonds, but also cut down on overall credit exposure.Benchmark: Barclays Long U.S. Government/Corporate IndexLow DurationSeeks current income with reduced volatility. Incorporates active asset allocation across fixed income sectors using short duration securities including a mix of both fixed and floating rate products while maintaining a balance between credit and interest rate risk.Benchmark: BofA/Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury IndexOpportunistic Core Plus Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return through a more aggressive active asset allocation approach across fixed income sectors while trying to mitigate risk and achieve better risk-adjusted returns. The strategy maintains a higher targeted alpha and tracking error.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexTotal Return TacticalSeeks to maximize total return across fixed income sectors while maintaining active risk management constraints. The strategy has two primary drivers of alpha: 1) Actively manages the risk exposure by changing the mix between government and credit. The credit component is diversified across fixed income sectors. 2) The strategy maintains a lower duration than the benchmark.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexSector Specific Fixed IncomeDescriptionBenchmarkEmerging Markets Fixed IncomeSeek high total return from current income and capital appreciation. The strategy is typically concentrated in U.S. dollar-denominated securities and favors corporates over sovereigns. We believe the corporate sector is a secularly improving credit story and is slightly more insulated from global unrest vs. sovereigns.Benchmark: JP Morgan Emerging Markets Global Diversified IndexFloating RateSeeks a high level of current income by investing primarily in floating rate loans and other floating rate investments while diversifying across industries and issuers. Preservation of capital stands and satisfaction of credit and valuation criteria comes before incremental yield.Benchmark: S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan IndexGlobal BondSeeks to generate strong risk-adjusted returns from the global bond markets. DoubleLine believes that combining bond and currency investments across countries creates a well diversified portfolio that can take advantage of different market, business and economic cyclesBenchmark: Citi World Government Bond Index (WGBI)Global InfrastructureInfrastructure debt has low correlation to other fixed income assets and can lower overall portfolio volatility while potentially delivering incremental yields in a fixed income portfolio. It's an asset class with growing investor demand. It's supported by strong underlying fundamentals and defensive attributes that are attractive. Projects provide essential services and can include, airports, toll roads, power plants, renewable energy, etc.  Client customization available.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexStrategic MBSStrategic MBS is a best ideas mortgages 100%. The team believes that the most reliable way to enhance returns is to exploit inefficiencies within the subsectors of the MBS market while maintaining active risk management constraints.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexTotal ReturnSeeks to maximize total return across fixed income sectors while maintaining active risk management constraints. The strategy has two primary drivers of alpha: 1) Actively managing risk exposures by changing the mix between government and credit which have potentially off-setting risks. Historically the strategy has used mortgages for both government and credit components because mortgages offer homogeneous fundamentals. 2) Duration is actively managed and maintained lower than the benchmark.Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond IndexEquitiesDescriptionBenchmarkShiller Enhanced CAPE®Seeks total return which exceeds the benchmark index. The strategy maintains a core portfolio of debt instruments that focuses on global fixed income sector rotation while simultaneously obtaining exposure to the Shiller CAPE® US Sector TR USD Index. The rules-based index aims to identify undervalued sectors based on a modified CAPE® Ratio which then uses a momentum factor to mitigate the effects of potential value traps. By using both a value indicator and a momentum indicator, the Index aims to provide more stable and improved risk adjusted returns.Benchmark: S&P 500CommoditiesDescriptionBenchmarkStrategic CommodityStrategic Commodity2 will maintain a core long-commodity biased weighting while tactically allocating to the long-short dollar-neutral commodity strategy when a long-only strategy may not be as attractive. The long commodity positions are focused on commodities that have historically exhibited the highest degree of backwardation while the long-short strategy utilizes fundamental signals to determine its allocation. The long bias will make up 50-100% of the strategy allocation while the opportunistic long/short will comprise 0-50%.Benchmark: Bloomberg Commodity IndexGlobal MacroDescriptionBenchmarkMulti-Asset GrowthSeeks long-term capital appreciation with an absolute return focus. The strategy provides a flexible global asset allocation framework that has three goals: capital appreciation, avoidance of catastrophic capital loss, and exploitation of market volatility. DoubleLine best Ideas Global Macro strategy which invests opportunistically in Commodities, Currencies, Equities and Fixed Income.Benchmark: Blended Benchmark3Alternative Investment StrategiesDescriptionBenchmarkOpportunistic CRE Debt StrategySeeks to generate stable current income while preserving capital through investments on a leveraged basis in a diversified portfolio of debt investments, or participations therein consisting primarily of first mortgage loans on commercial real estate; CMBS, including CMBS B-Pieces; subordinated commercial mortgage loans, including B-Notes; and mezzanine loans secured by equity interests in commercial real estate. The strategy intends to utilize leverage to enhance returns on its loan origination and acquisition investments. Four year investment period from final closing date.Benchmark: Barclays U.S. CMBS Index Opportunistic Income – Fixed IncomeSeeks maximum current income and total return. Strategy known as Jeffrey Gundlach's "Best Ideas" fixed Income strategy. Historically the strategy has been concentrated heavily in Mortgages but invest opportunistically. The strategy employs leverage.
