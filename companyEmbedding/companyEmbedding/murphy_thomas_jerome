Dear Ann and Family,  I was deeply saddened on hearing the news of Tom's passing. I did not know until today. I am so sorry. He was a good friend, a devoted and hard working member of the Medical Care Commission, and most importantly one who believed in doing the right thing and trying to make the world a better place for all. He will be missed, but long remembered for the good man he was.    With sincere sympathy,        Bob Fitzgerald
