Early life and education[edit]
De Jongh was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on St. Thomas. As a child he attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas. After his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools. During the summer, de Jongh would return to St. Thomas to assist in his father's law firm. De Jongh, graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1976. After his graduation he attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. During his college career he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an urban study program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College in Ohio.[4] De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981.[5]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, de Jongh returned to the Virgin Islands. He worked for several years with the Tri-Island Economic Development Council, during which he helped receive funding for the preservation of historic Virgin Island buildings, before taking a job with Chase Manhattan Bank.[6] De Jongh first worked as an executive in the company's Puerto Rico office before returning to the Virgin Islands after earning the position of Consumer Manager of Operations in the U.S., British Virgin Islands and Saint Maarten. Under his leadership, Chase placed more emphasis on personal over corporate banking in the Caribbean and increased home mortgage lending.
In 1987, de Jongh was appointed as Commissioner of Finance by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, his first government position and one that had once been held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. In addition to his primary responsibilities for financial administration, de Jongh served as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and as an Executive Director and board member of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. He was key in financial reforming and boosting the economy of the territory in the early 1990s. He also worked as an executive assistant to the governor's office, and he helped to coordinate better interagency cooperation.[4] In 1992, he left government and returned to the private sector. That same year, de Jongh joined the real estate and insurance holding company, Lockhart Companies Incorporated where he served as President, CEO and a member of the board of directors until 2002.[7] In 1993, he joined Public Financial Management, Inc., as a Senior Managing Consultant, where he helped to draft and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C.[5] From 1999-2001, de Jongh served as president of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce and headed a task force that created the Five Year Operating and Strategic Financial Plan for the government of the Virgin Islands, co-chaired a private-public sector group to negotiate with cruise lines and was selected as Rotary II's Person of the Year.[4]
In 2002, de Jongh left Lockhart Companies and unsuccessfully ran for governor as an independent candidate on a platform that addressed education, economic opportunity, crime, healthcare and financial management. De Jongh founded Chilmark Partners, a financial advisory firm focused on engagements in the Eastern Caribbean in 2003.[8]
Political career[edit]
In 2005, it was reported that de Jongh led all potential candidates to become the next governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands when the incumbent vacated his seat the following year.[9] In 2006, he ran as a Democrat and won the Democratic Party primary defeating Lieutenant Governor Vargrave Richards and Senator Adlah Donastorg with 52.2% of the votes.[10] He won the governorship in 2006 after defeating former Lieutenant Governor Mapp in a November 21 run-off election with over 57% of the vote.[11]
De Jongh was sworn in as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007.[11] His administration focused on addressing early childhood education issues, established the Children and Families Council, sought partnerships with cruise lines, airlines and rum companies, championed economic diversification and implemented revitalization projects for the islands that comprise the U.S. Virgin Islands.[6] De Jongh also created programs to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels. After announcing they would seek a second term in office, de Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis won the Democratic primary election on September 11, 2010,[12] after receiving 53% of the vote in the primary, more than all three of their Democratic challengers combined.[12][13]
De Jongh faced independent candidate Mapp, a former Lt. Governor, in the general election on November 2, 2010.[12] The contest between de Jongh and Mapp was essentially a rematch of the top two contenders from the 2006 gubernatorial election.[12] On November 2, 2010, De Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis were re-elected to second term, taking 17,535 votes, or 56.27%.[14] De Jongh defeated the independent gubernatorial ticket of Mapp and Malik Sekou, who came in second with 13,580 votes.[14] After reaching his term limit, de Jongh left office on January 5, 2015.
During his second term, his administration focused on the completion of the "middle mile" fiber optic network,[15] implemented Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act,[16] and oversaw the impact of the closure of Hovensa, LLC and its oil refinery on the island of St. Croix.[17]
Post gubernatorial[edit]
In August 2015, de Jongh and Julito Francis, former director of finance of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, were charged with embezzlement and neglecting to pay public monies relating to the alleged conversion of Virgin Islands public to fund security improvements to the former governor's private residence.[18] In January 2016, V.I. Superior Court Senior Sitting Judge Darryl Donohue dismissed the charges against de Jongh.[19]
In December 2016, de Jongh was appointed to the board of directors at Altisource Asset Management Corporation.[20] De Jongh also serves as Principal of Chilmark Investment Partners, LLC.[6]
Personal life[edit]
De Jongh has been married to Cecile René Galiber since 1986. The couple have three children.[1]

During his college career he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an urban study program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College in Ohio.[4] De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981.[5]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, de Jongh returned to the Virgin Islands. He worked for several years with the Tri-Island Economic Development Council, during which he helped receive funding for the preservation of historic Virgin Island buildings, before taking a job with Chase Manhattan Bank.[6] De Jongh first worked as an executive in the company's Puerto Rico office before returning to the Virgin Islands after earning the position of Consumer Manager of Operations in the U.S., British Virgin Islands and Saint Maarten. Under his leadership, Chase placed more emphasis on personal over corporate banking in the Caribbean and increased home mortgage lending.
In 1987, de Jongh was appointed as Commissioner of Finance by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, his first government position and one that had once been held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. In addition to his primary responsibilities for financial administration, de Jongh served as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and as an Executive Director and board member of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. He was key in financial reforming and boosting the economy of the territory in the early 1990s. He also worked as an executive assistant to the governor's office, and he helped to coordinate better interagency cooperation.[4] In 1992, he left government and returned to the private sector. That same year, de Jongh joined the real estate and insurance holding company, Lockhart Companies Incorporated where he served as President, CEO and a member of the board of directors until 2002.[7] In 1993, he joined Public Financial Management, Inc., as a Senior Managing Consultant, where he helped to draft and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C.[5] From 1999-2001, de Jongh served as president of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce and headed a task force that created the Five Year Operating and Strategic Financial Plan for the government of the Virgin Islands, co-chaired a private-public sector group to negotiate with cruise lines and was selected as Rotary II's Person of the Year.[4]
In 2002, de Jongh left Lockhart Companies and unsuccessfully ran for governor as an independent candidate on a platform that addressed education, economic opportunity, crime, healthcare and financial management. De Jongh founded Chilmark Partners, a financial advisory firm focused on engagements in the Eastern Caribbean in 2003.[8]
Political career[edit]
In 2005, it was reported that de Jongh led all potential candidates to become the next governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands when the incumbent vacated his seat the following year.[9] In 2006, he ran as a Democrat and won the Democratic Party primary defeating Lieutenant Governor Vargrave Richards and Senator Adlah Donastorg with 52.2% of the votes.[10] He won the governorship in 2006 after defeating former Lieutenant Governor Mapp in a November 21 run-off election with over 57% of the vote.[11]
De Jongh was sworn in as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007.[11] His administration focused on addressing early childhood education issues, established the Children and Families Council, sought partnerships with cruise lines, airlines and rum companies, championed economic diversification and implemented revitalization projects for the islands that comprise the U.S. Virgin Islands.[6] De Jongh also created programs to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels. After announcing they would seek a second term in office, de Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis won the Democratic primary election on September 11, 2010,[12] after receiving 53% of the vote in the primary, more than all three of their Democratic challengers combined.[12][13]
De Jongh faced independent candidate Mapp, a former Lt. Governor, in the general election on November 2, 2010.[12] The contest between de Jongh and Mapp was essentially a rematch of the top two contenders from the 2006 gubernatorial election.[12] On November 2, 2010, De Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis were re-elected to second term, taking 17,535 votes, or 56.27%.[14] De Jongh defeated the independent gubernatorial ticket of Mapp and Malik Sekou, who came in second with 13,580 votes.[14] After reaching his term limit, de Jongh left office on January 5, 2015.
During his second term, his administration focused on the completion of the "middle mile" fiber optic network,[15] implemented Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act,[16] and oversaw the impact of the closure of Hovensa, LLC and its oil refinery on the island of St. Croix.[17]
Post gubernatorial[edit]
In August 2015, de Jongh and Julito Francis, former director of finance of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, were charged with embezzlement and neglecting to pay public monies relating to the alleged conversion of Virgin Islands public to fund security improvements to the former governor's private residence.[18] In January 2016, V.I. Superior Court Senior Sitting Judge Darryl Donohue dismissed the charges against de Jongh.[19]
In December 2016, de Jongh was appointed to the board of directors at Altisource Asset Management Corporation.[20] De Jongh also serves as Principal of Chilmark Investment Partners, LLC.[6]
Personal life[edit]
De Jongh has been married to Cecile René Galiber since 1986. The couple have three children.[1]

Early life and education[edit]
De Jongh was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on St. Thomas. As a child he attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas. After his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Early life and education[edit]
De Jongh was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on St. Thomas. As a child he attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas. After his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools. During the summer, de Jongh would return to St. Thomas to assist in his father's law firm. De Jongh, graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1976. After his graduation he attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. During his college career he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an urban study program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College in Ohio.[4] De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981.[5]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, de Jongh returned to the Virgin Islands. He worked for several years with the Tri-Island Economic Development Council, during which he helped receive funding for the preservation of historic Virgin Island buildings, before taking a job with Chase Manhattan Bank.[6] De Jongh first worked as an executive in the company's Puerto Rico office before returning to the Virgin Islands after earning the position of Consumer Manager of Operations in the U.S., British Virgin Islands and Saint Maarten. Under his leadership, Chase placed more emphasis on personal over corporate banking in the Caribbean and increased home mortgage lending.
In 1987, de Jongh was appointed as Commissioner of Finance by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, his first government position and one that had once been held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. In addition to his primary responsibilities for financial administration, de Jongh served as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and as an Executive Director and board member of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. He was key in financial reforming and boosting the economy of the territory in the early 1990s. He also worked as an executive assistant to the governor's office, and he helped to coordinate better interagency cooperation.[4] In 1992, he left government and returned to the private sector. That same year, de Jongh joined the real estate and insurance holding company, Lockhart Companies Incorporated where he served as President, CEO and a member of the board of directors until 2002.[7] In 1993, he joined Public Financial Management, Inc., as a Senior Managing Consultant, where he helped to draft and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C.[5] From 1999-2001, de Jongh served as president of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce and headed a task force that created the Five Year Operating and Strategic Financial Plan for the government of the Virgin Islands, co-chaired a private-public sector group to negotiate with cruise lines and was selected as Rotary II's Person of the Year.[4]
In 2002, de Jongh left Lockhart Companies and unsuccessfully ran for governor as an independent candidate on a platform that addressed education, economic opportunity, crime, healthcare and financial management. De Jongh founded Chilmark Partners, a financial advisory firm focused on engagements in the Eastern Caribbean in 2003.[8]
Political career[edit]
In 2005, it was reported that de Jongh led all potential candidates to become the next governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands when the incumbent vacated his seat the following year.[9] In 2006, he ran as a Democrat and won the Democratic Party primary defeating Lieutenant Governor Vargrave Richards and Senator Adlah Donastorg with 52.2% of the votes.[10] He won the governorship in 2006 after defeating former Lieutenant Governor Mapp in a November 21 run-off election with over 57% of the vote.[11]
De Jongh was sworn in as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007.[11] His administration focused on addressing early childhood education issues, established the Children and Families Council, sought partnerships with cruise lines, airlines and rum companies, championed economic diversification and implemented revitalization projects for the islands that comprise the U.S. Virgin Islands.[6] De Jongh also created programs to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels. After announcing they would seek a second term in office, de Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis won the Democratic primary election on September 11, 2010,[12] after receiving 53% of the vote in the primary, more than all three of their Democratic challengers combined.[12][13]
De Jongh faced independent candidate Mapp, a former Lt. Governor, in the general election on November 2, 2010.[12] The contest between de Jongh and Mapp was essentially a rematch of the top two contenders from the 2006 gubernatorial election.[12] On November 2, 2010, De Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis were re-elected to second term, taking 17,535 votes, or 56.27%.[14] De Jongh defeated the independent gubernatorial ticket of Mapp and Malik Sekou, who came in second with 13,580 votes.[14] After reaching his term limit, de Jongh left office on January 5, 2015.
During his second term, his administration focused on the completion of the "middle mile" fiber optic network,[15] implemented Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act,[16] and oversaw the impact of the closure of Hovensa, LLC and its oil refinery on the island of St. Croix.[17]
Post gubernatorial[edit]
In August 2015, de Jongh and Julito Francis, former director of finance of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, were charged with embezzlement and neglecting to pay public monies relating to the alleged conversion of Virgin Islands public to fund security improvements to the former governor's private residence.[18] In January 2016, V.I. Superior Court Senior Sitting Judge Darryl Donohue dismissed the charges against de Jongh.[19]
In December 2016, de Jongh was appointed to the board of directors at Altisource Asset Management Corporation.[20] De Jongh also serves as Principal of Chilmark Investment Partners, LLC.[6]
Personal life[edit]
De Jongh has been married to Cecile René Galiber since 1986. The couple have three children.[1]

InfoJohn P. DeJongh, Jr. was inaugurated as the seventh Governor of the United States Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007. 

John Percy de Jongh, Jr., was born on November 13, 1957, is the eldest of three sons of John P. de Jongh, Sr., and Delores Webb de Jongh. John also has two sisters, Judy McCoy and Mary Frate.  

John attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas until his parents divorced. As a single parent, his mother, Delores, raised John and his brothers, Stanley and Sydney, while working as a social worker with the Detroit Public Schools. John graduated from Catholic Central High School in 1977 and went on to Antioch College where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1981. While at Antioch, John held work-study jobs in Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit and St. Thomas, and he also completed an urban study program in the United Kingdom, the former Yugoslavia and Holland. 

Immediately after college, John returned home to the Virgin Islands. His first job was with Tri-Island Economic Development Council. While at Tri-Island, John developed and successfully obtained grant funding for the re-development of historic structures in Savan and Frederiksted. Subsequently, John was hired by Chase Manhattan Bank and selected to attend its Credit Development Program in Puerto Rico. During his six years at Chase, John became the first Country Consumer Manager responsible for all consumer banking products in the U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands (BVI) and St. Maarten. Under John’s leadership, Chase installed the first off-site ATMs, increased home mortgage lending, as well as personal loans, and changed the bank’s focus to consumer lending in the BVI. 

In 1986, John married Cecile René Galiber of St. Croix, daughter of the late Dr. Andre Galiber and Edith Rose Lewis Galiber. They are the proud parents of one daughter and two sons. 

Though John’s time at Chase was extremely positive, he was drawn to public service. Governor Juan Luis appointed him to the Industrial Development Commission in 1984, and later reappointed him. John was the youngest Commissioner of Finance when appointed to the position by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, a position once held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. As Commissioner from 1987 to 1990, John was central in drafting legislation establishing the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority and serving as its first Executive Director. He also helped draft legislation establishing and funding the Capital Improvement Program, and the Affordable Housing Program. He also oversaw the completion of the Leroy Quinn Building on St. Croix and wrote the GAAP Conversion, the work plan for the Government’s financial reporting.  

As Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority (1988-1992), John oversaw the execution of bond offerings that were essential in providing funding for new power generating units on St. Croix and St. Thomas and for the underground power cable servicing St. John. He ensured the smooth transition when the water system was transferred from the Department of Public Works to WAPA, and initiated the Alva MacFarlane Scholarship Program, which has allowed numerous Virgin Islanders to further their education in engineering and related fields. 

From 1990 to 1992, John also served as Executive Assistant to Governor Farrelly, a position that his father, John de Jongh, Sr., had once held during earlier Administrations. As Executive Assistant to the Governor, John coordinated and implemented gubernatorial policy throughout executive branch departments and agencies. While serving as Executive Assistant to the Governor, he also held the position of Director of Finance and Administration of the V.I. Public Finance Authority.  

In 1993, John reentered the private sector, as a Senior Managing Consultant for Public Financial Management, Inc., the largest public finance advisory firm in the United States. As Co-Manager of the firm’s Strategic Municipal Consulting practice, John helped develop and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia; New Haven, Connecticut; and Washington, D.C., all of which dramatically improved their financial standing. 

Most recently, John served as President and Chief Operating Officer and Director of Lockhart Companies Incorporated. He oversaw its expansion of the real estate portfolio and negotiated its purchase of two property and casualty insurance companies and a premium finance business. During this time, John also served as President of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce, where he worked to ensure private sector competitiveness for small businesses and employee stability and growth in the job market. John also served as President of the Karen Ingeborg Lockhart Foundation and as a trustee of the Government Employees Retirement System. He recently served as Chairman of the Virgin Islands Economic Recovery Task Force, which produced The Five Year Strategic and Operating Plan, as well as Co-Chair of the Cruise Ship Task Force, which negotiated the Long Term Operating Agreement with members of the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association. In March of 2000, John was chosen Rotary II’s Person of the Year.  

In 2003, John along with his good friend Desmond Skeete, established Chilmark Partners, LLC to do financial advisory work in the Eastern Caribbean. They have undertaken engagements in the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Barbados involving real estate, banking, and insurance. 

John continued his active public service as a member of the Board of Directors of the Community Foundation of the Virgin Islands. He served as Foundation President for three terms, during which time the agency substantially increased its mini-grants program and scholarship awards to Virgin Islands students, and initiated an annual study that highlights the economic conditions of children and families in our community. John also served as the first Executive Director of the V.I. Democratic Party. He currently also serves as a trustee of Antilles School.  [Link]

Early life and education[edit]
De Jongh was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on St. Thomas. As a child he attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas. After his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools. During the summer, de Jongh would return to St. Thomas to assist in his father's law firm. De Jongh, graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1976. After his graduation he attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. During his college career he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an urban study program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College in Ohio.[4] De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981.[5]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, de Jongh returned to the Virgin Islands. He worked for several years with the Tri-Island Economic Development Council, during which he helped receive funding for the preservation of historic Virgin Island buildings, before taking a job with Chase Manhattan Bank.[6] De Jongh first worked as an executive in the company's Puerto Rico office before returning to the Virgin Islands after earning the position of Consumer Manager of Operations in the U.S., British Virgin Islands and Saint Maarten. Under his leadership, Chase placed more emphasis on personal over corporate banking in the Caribbean and increased home mortgage lending.
In 1987, de Jongh was appointed as Commissioner of Finance by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, his first government position and one that had once been held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. In addition to his primary responsibilities for financial administration, de Jongh served as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and as an Executive Director and board member of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. He was key in financial reforming and boosting the economy of the territory in the early 1990s. He also worked as an executive assistant to the governor's office, and he helped to coordinate better interagency cooperation.[4] In 1992, he left government and returned to the private sector. That same year, de Jongh joined the real estate and insurance holding company, Lockhart Companies Incorporated where he served as President, CEO and a member of the board of directors until 2002.[7] In 1993, he joined Public Financial Management, Inc., as a Senior Managing Consultant, where he helped to draft and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C.[5] From 1999-2001, de Jongh served as president of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce and headed a task force that created the Five Year Operating and Strategic Financial Plan for the government of the Virgin Islands, co-chaired a private-public sector group to negotiate with cruise lines and was selected as Rotary II's Person of the Year.[4]
In 2002, de Jongh left Lockhart Companies and unsuccessfully ran for governor as an independent candidate on a platform that addressed education, economic opportunity, crime, healthcare and financial management. De Jongh founded Chilmark Partners, a financial advisory firm focused on engagements in the Eastern Caribbean in 2003.[8]
Political career[edit]
In 2005, it was reported that de Jongh led all potential candidates to become the next governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands when the incumbent vacated his seat the following year.[9] In 2006, he ran as a Democrat and won the Democratic Party primary defeating Lieutenant Governor Vargrave Richards and Senator Adlah Donastorg with 52.2% of the votes.[10] He won the governorship in 2006 after defeating former Lieutenant Governor Mapp in a November 21 run-off election with over 57% of the vote.[11]
De Jongh was sworn in as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007.[11] His administration focused on addressing early childhood education issues, established the Children and Families Council, sought partnerships with cruise lines, airlines and rum companies, championed economic diversification and implemented revitalization projects for the islands that comprise the U.S. Virgin Islands.[6] De Jongh also created programs to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels. After announcing they would seek a second term in office, de Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis won the Democratic primary election on September 11, 2010,[12] after receiving 53% of the vote in the primary, more than all three of their Democratic challengers combined.[12][13]
De Jongh faced independent candidate Mapp, a former Lt. Governor, in the general election on November 2, 2010.[12] The contest between de Jongh and Mapp was essentially a rematch of the top two contenders from the 2006 gubernatorial election.[12] On November 2, 2010, De Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis were re-elected to second term, taking 17,535 votes, or 56.27%.[14] De Jongh defeated the independent gubernatorial ticket of Mapp and Malik Sekou, who came in second with 13,580 votes.[14] After reaching his term limit, de Jongh left office on January 5, 2015.
During his second term, his administration focused on the completion of the "middle mile" fiber optic network,[15] implemented Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act,[16] and oversaw the impact of the closure of Hovensa, LLC and its oil refinery on the island of St. Croix.[17]
Post gubernatorial[edit]

John Percy de Jongh, Jr. (born November 13, 1957) is an American businessman and politician who served as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. He has been active in Virgin Islands politics and the business community since returning to St. Thomas after graduating from college in 1981. De Jongh has been involved in community development, commercial banking, served on the boards of business and philanthropic organizations, appointed to government positions and elected to public office.[1]
De Jongh ran for governor in the 2002 general election as an independent candidate,[2] placing second with 24.4% of the vote and losing to the incumbent, Charles W. Turnbull. In the 2006 general election de Jongh ran as the Democratic Party candidate and defeated former Lieutenant Governor Kenneth Mapp in a runoff and became governor. In 2010, he was re-elected to a second term and served until January 5, 2015, when he was term limited.[3]

Early life and education[edit]
De Jongh was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on St. Thomas. As a child he attended Sts. Peter and Paul School on St. Thomas. After his parents' divorce, he lived with his mother, Dolores, and two brothers, Stanley and Sydney, in Detroit, Michigan where his mother was a social worker for the Detroit Public Schools. During the summer, de Jongh would return to St. Thomas to assist in his father's law firm. De Jongh, graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1976. After his graduation he attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. During his college career he held work-study jobs in Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and St. Thomas and completed an urban study program that involved travel to the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia and The Netherlands. He earned an economics degree from Antioch College in Ohio.[4] De Jongh graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Antioch College in 1981.[5]
Business career[edit]
After graduating from college, de Jongh returned to the Virgin Islands. He worked for several years with the Tri-Island Economic Development Council, during which he helped receive funding for the preservation of historic Virgin Island buildings, before taking a job with Chase Manhattan Bank.[6] De Jongh first worked as an executive in the company's Puerto Rico office before returning to the Virgin Islands after earning the position of Consumer Manager of Operations in the U.S., British Virgin Islands and Saint Maarten. Under his leadership, Chase placed more emphasis on personal over corporate banking in the Caribbean and increased home mortgage lending.
In 1987, de Jongh was appointed as Commissioner of Finance by Governor Alexander A. Farrelly, his first government position and one that had once been held by his grandfather, Percy de Jongh. In addition to his primary responsibilities for financial administration, de Jongh served as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority and as an Executive Director and board member of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority. He was key in financial reforming and boosting the economy of the territory in the early 1990s. He also worked as an executive assistant to the governor's office, and he helped to coordinate better interagency cooperation.[4] In 1992, he left government and returned to the private sector. That same year, de Jongh joined the real estate and insurance holding company, Lockhart Companies Incorporated where he served as President, CEO and a member of the board of directors until 2002.[7] In 1993, he joined Public Financial Management, Inc., as a Senior Managing Consultant, where he helped to draft and implement Five-Year Plans for the cities of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C.[5] From 1999-2001, de Jongh served as president of the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber of Commerce and headed a task force that created the Five Year Operating and Strategic Financial Plan for the government of the Virgin Islands, co-chaired a private-public sector group to negotiate with cruise lines and was selected as Rotary II's Person of the Year.[4]
In 2002, de Jongh left Lockhart Companies and unsuccessfully ran for governor as an independent candidate on a platform that addressed education, economic opportunity, crime, healthcare and financial management. De Jongh founded Chilmark Partners, a financial advisory firm focused on engagements in the Eastern Caribbean in 2003.[8]
Political career[edit]
In 2005, it was reported that de Jongh led all potential candidates to become the next governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands when the incumbent vacated his seat the following year.[9] In 2006, he ran as a Democrat and won the Democratic Party primary defeating Lieutenant Governor Vargrave Richards and Senator Adlah Donastorg with 52.2% of the votes.[10] He won the governorship in 2006 after defeating former Lieutenant Governor Mapp in a November 21 run-off election with over 57% of the vote.[11]
De Jongh was sworn in as the 7th elected Governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands on January 1, 2007.[11] His administration focused on addressing early childhood education issues, established the Children and Families Council, sought partnerships with cruise lines, airlines and rum companies, championed economic diversification and implemented revitalization projects for the islands that comprise the U.S. Virgin Islands.[6] De Jongh also created programs to reduce the territory's dependence on fossil fuels. After announcing they would seek a second term in office, de Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis won the Democratic primary election on September 11, 2010,[12] after receiving 53% of the vote in the primary, more than all three of their Democratic challengers combined.[12][13]
De Jongh faced independent candidate Mapp, a former Lt. Governor, in the general election on November 2, 2010.[12] The contest between de Jongh and Mapp was essentially a rematch of the top two contenders from the 2006 gubernatorial election.[12] On November 2, 2010, De Jongh and Lt. Governor Gregory Francis were re-elected to second term, taking 17,535 votes, or 56.27%.[14] De Jongh defeated the independent gubernatorial ticket of Mapp and Malik Sekou, who came in second with 13,580 votes.[14] After reaching his term limit, de Jongh left office on January 5, 2015.
During his second term, his administration focused on the completion of the "middle mile" fiber optic network,[15] implemented Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act,[16] and oversaw the impact of the closure of Hovensa, LLC and its oil refinery on the island of St. Croix.[17]
Post gubernatorial[edit]
In August 2015, de Jongh and Julito Francis, former director of finance of the Virgin Islands Public Finance Authority, were charged with embezzlement and neglecting to pay public monies relating to the alleged conversion of Virgin Islands public to fund security improvements to the former governor's private residence.[18] In January 2016, V.I. Superior Court Senior Sitting Judge Darryl Donohue dismissed the charges against de Jongh.[19]
In December 2016, de Jongh was appointed to the board of directors at Altisource Asset Management Corporation.[20] De Jongh also serves as Principal of Chilmark Investment Partners, LLC.[6]
Personal life[edit]
De Jongh has been married to Cecile René Galiber since 1986. The couple have three children.[1]
