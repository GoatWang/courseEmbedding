Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

NEW YORK & BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Siebert Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:SIEB) and Kennedy Cabot Acquisition, LLC 
      are pleased to announce they have entered into a definitive agreement 
      under which Kennedy Cabot Acquisition will acquire approximately 90% of 
      the outstanding common stock of Siebert Financial Corp. from the Estate 
      of Muriel F. Siebert. Siebert Financial is the owner of Muriel Siebert & 
      Co., Inc., the broker-dealer founded in 1967 by the late Muriel F. 
      “Mickie” Siebert, the first woman to own a seat on the New York Stock 
      Exchange and the first woman to head a NYSE member firm.
    


      Jane Macon, the Chairwoman of Siebert Financial said, “We look forward 
      to a smooth transition and are pleased that the enduring vision and 
      legacy established by Mickie Siebert nearly fifty years ago will 
      continue into the future.”
    

      Gloria E. Gebbia, the owner and managing member of Kennedy Cabot 
      Acquisition said, “The team being assembled at Kennedy Cabot Acquisition 
      has many years of experience in the brokerage industry including 
      successfully acquiring and growing broker-dealers and bring a strong and 
      experienced management team to Siebert Financial Corp.”
    

      Under the terms of the agreement, Kennedy Cabot Acquisition will make a 
      tender offer for the outstanding common stock of Siebert Financial not 
      owned by the Estate. Holders of Siebert Financial shares may accept the 
      tender offer and sell their shares or not tender their shares and remain 
      shareholders of Siebert Financial. The closing of the sale and the 
      tender offer is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2016, 
      conditioned upon approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
      (FINRA).
    

      Prior to closing, Siebert Financial anticipates paying a dividend to all 
      Siebert Financial shareholders in the amount of approximately $0.20 per 
      share.
    

      Siebert Financial’s principal activity is providing online and 
      traditional discount brokerage and related services to retail investors 
      through the broker-dealer, and serves as a registered investment advisor 
      through its Siebert Investment Advisors business unit.
    

      Siebert Financial considers the sale to Kennedy Cabot Acquisition to be 
      the strongest strategic alternative to continue the company and maximize 
      shareholder value in the wake of the 2013 passing of Muriel F. “Mickie” 
      Siebert, Siebert Financial’s founder and former Chairwoman, President 
      and Chief Executive Officer.
    

      Kennedy Cabot Acquisition plans to continue to build upon the strong 
      existing foundation at Siebert Financial to further strengthen the 
      customer experience. The acquisition agreement does not provide for the 
      merger of Siebert Financial with or into Kennedy Cabot Acquisition.
    

      Mrs. Gebbia added, “Speaking for myself and the other principals of 
      Kennedy Cabot Acquisition, we are all very excited about the acquisition 
      and embrace the opportunity not only to expand the business but also to 
      build a world-class financial firm dedicated to serving client financial 
      needs.”
    

      Mrs. Gebbia and her family are the majority owners of StockCross 
      Financial Services, Inc. The Gebbia family has been successfully 
      involved with financial services companies since the early 1970's and 
      during such time they built a broker-dealer into a national brand, which 
      they sold to Toronto Dominion Bank in 1997. Mrs. Gebbia is also the 
      President of the Associates for Breast and Prostate Cancer Studies which 
      raises funds for the John Wayne Cancer Institute. Through Mrs. Gebbia’s 
      leadership since 1998 over $14 million has been raised for cancer 
      research studies.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
