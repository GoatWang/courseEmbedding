Paulson Leads First Half Meltdown For Hedge Funds

							It's official. The first half of this year has been a disaster for many hedge fund managers, as a large majority of managers contained in a confidential database are in the red. One of the worst performers is John Paulson, whose Paulson Advantage Fund Limited was down 9.5 percent in June and 15.3 percent for the year-to-date.

    Its official. The first half of this year has been a
    disaster for many hedge fund managers, as a large majority of
    managers contained in a confidential database are in the red. 

    One of the worst performers is John Paulson, whose Paulson
    Advantage Fund Limited was down 9.5 percent in June and 15.3
    percent for the year-to-date.
Paulson International Fund Ltd was down 3.6 percent in June,
    putting it in the red by 0.8 percent for the year.
One caveat: This data is through June 28. And remember, the
    global markets rallied to two subsequent days.
So, there is a good chance that Paulson International and a
    number of others that were straddling profitability wound up
    eking out a gain for the first half.
Even so, the S&P 500 was up 5 percent for the first six
    months.
One fund whose data is available through the end of June
     it is not included in this database  is David
    Einhorns Greenlight Capital. And the results were not
    pretty.
The value investing/opportunistic hedge fund manager poised
    to buy a minority stake in the New York Mets reported he lost
    2.9 percent in June. This put him in the red for the quarter by
    1.9 percent.
For the first half of the year, he was down 5.2 percent.
The S&P 500 was down 0.4 percent in the second
    quarter.
The investment returns were reported by Greenlight Re, the
    insurance company controlled by Einhorn. It points out that
    investment returns are based on the total assets in its
    investment account, which are managed by DME Advisors, LP and
    include the majority of its equity capital and collected
    premiums.
As of June 30, Greenlights largest disclosed long
    positions are Apple, Arkema, gold, Microsoft, Pfizer and
    Vodafone Group.
Apple was up 3.8 percent in the first half. However, its
    shares are down 7.8 percent or so since their mid-February
    high.
The price of gold was up 5 percent in the first half.
The worst performing hedge fund so far seems to be MLM Macro
    Fund Ltd, down 7.7 percent for the month through June 28 and
    down 22.8 percent for the year, through June 28. 
As I pointed out recently, the firm started out in 1986 as a
    futures specialist. Its first product was an actively managed
    diversified futures program, according to its website. 
    Two years later, it launched the MLM Index, which it calls the
    first price-based benchmark for managed futures.
The second worst performing fund this year is Altis Fund
    Ltd, down 20.8 percent. As of the end of May, the firm had
    $1.48 billion under management.
The firm was founded in 2001 with just $1.2 million in
    assets by Zbigniew Hermaszewski, Natasha Reeve-Gray, Alex
    Brunwin and Stephen Hedgecock.
The best performer among the funds in the database is
    Sandler Plus Offshore fund, up 10.7 percent. In fact it has
    made money every month since February. The fund, run by Andrew
    Sandler, is very small, with just $14 million in assets at the
    beginning of the year, according to the U.S. Offshore Funds
    Directory.
Of the larger funds, the GLG Emerging Equity fund was up 9.6
    percent through June 28. And it has made money every month this
    year.
Elsewhere among well-known names:

Winton Capital, down 2.4 percent in June, up 0.4 percent
      in first half.
Canyon Value Realization Fund Ltd., -2.1 percent, -0.27
      percent.
Jana Partners, -5.1 percent, 0.9 percent.
Third Point Fund Ltd., -2.6 percent, 1.1 percent.
York Fund, -2.4 percent, 1.1 percent.

Canyon’s capital matters

							Mitch Julis & Josh Friedman have built Canyon into the 13th largest hedge fund firm in the U.S.

          the spectrum from leveraged buyouts to leveraged
          die-outs

When Radio One, a leading U.S. broadcaster with an
    African-American, urban audience, wanted to buy out other
    equity holders to gain a controlling stake in one of its TV
    properties, it turned to an unlikely place for the money: hedge
    fund Canyon Capital Advisors of Los Angeles.
Unlike traditional institutional investors, Canyon
    didn’t need to worry about getting a rating
    agency’s seal of approval and in February quickly
    put together a private debt offering of $119 million,
    collateralized by the assets of the cable TV station being
    purchased. With a junk-bond-like 10% coupon and a five-year
    maturity, the deal snared Canyon the kind of returns that hedge
    funds salivate over.
Canyon, a $20 billion firm (with $17.5 billion in hedge fund
    assets), has become the 13th largest hedge fund firm in the
    U.S., in part because it doesn’t shy away from
    originating such deals.
"We often will approach a company that we understand, and
    we’ll design a piece of paper that really solves
    their problems and really works for us," says Mitch Julis, the
    56-year-old former New Yorker who co-founded Canyon with
    55-year-old Massachusetts native Josh Friedman.
Buddies since rooming together at Harvard University, the
    two men formed Canyon in 1990, right after the firm where they
    worked, Drexel Burnham Lambert, blew up in a cloud of
    scandal.
The Drexel philosophy—not to mention the West Coast
    location where the duo once fashioned deals with infamous
    1980s-era junk bond king Mike Milken—still heavily
    influences the unusual investment approach taken by Canyon. The
    firm has also benefited from its Drexel connections and the
    network that grew out of it. Says one rival hedge fund manager:
    "They have proprietary deal flow that other people just would
    never see."
In the Radio One deal, for example, Canyon’s
    ties to Moelis & Co., the investment bank that served as
    the offering’s underwriter, reach back to Drexel:
    The firm’s founder, Ken Moelis, was a colleague of
    Friedman and Julis there. 



 




 
Josh Friedman: Our broad mandate gives us a bit
          more flexibility 





"We knew the management team, the assets and the financial
    advisor. So, rather than wait for the market to scramble around
    and then go out and do it, we provided a solution ourselves,"
    says Friedman.
Such deals are an important part of Canyon’s
    investment strategy and one that investors find attractive.
    "Because they’re a big enough player, they have
    the ability to source their own deals and they’re
    not just playing in the secondary market and tagging along on
    other people’s deals," says Bruce Guiot, chief
    investment officer of Miami University and a Canyon investor.
    "They are proactive in going out to companies and saying,
    'You’ve got this capital or debt structure, but we
    think we can put this arrangement in place to improve your
    balance sheet and provide an opportunity for us and other
    investors,’ and I think that gives them an
    opportunity set that’s bigger than many
    others."
Friedman and Julis credit their time at Drexel with teaching
    them the approach that has become the backbone of Canyon:
    "Capital structure matters." That’s their mantra,
    and one they say their mentor Milken taught them well.
"We saw financial innovation and design that was premised
    very much on that idea and could see very quickly where
    opportunities arose to satisfy the needs of both an issuer and
    an investor," explains Julis. "You also saw the life cycle of
    companies and how to recycle ideas. Between Josh and myself, we
    spanned the spectrum from leveraged buyouts to leveraged
    die-outs, and beyond credit we understood the dynamics of
    balance sheets, how they change and how to capitalize on them
    from an investor’s standpoint."
The philosophy has paid off for Canyon, a debt-focused
    multistrategy fund with a bent towards distressed or
    high-yielding securities in such disparate areas as residential
    mortgage-backed securities—which comprise some $4
    billion to $4.5 billion of the firm’s total
    assets—airline leases, gaming companies, financial
    institutions and media entities, among others.



 

Fact File: Canyon Capital Advisors
Assets under management: $20 billion
Flagship: Canyon Value Realization Fund
Performance: 11.2% annualized
Founded: 1990
Offices: Los Angeles, Manhattan, London
Founders: Mitch Julis & Josh
            Friedman






The firm’s $9.1 billion flagship Canyon Value
    Realization Fund has returned 11.2% since inception, with only
    two down years: 1998, when it lost 15.75%, and 2008, when it
    fell 29.25%.
Since 2008 the distressed environment has been good to
    Canyon, which has been on a roll. In 2009 it gained 55%, net of
    fees. That performance was followed by gains of 14.7% in 2010
    and 4.5% through the end of April. Comparatively, the AR
    Multistrategy Index was up 20.18% in 2009, 9.12% in 2010 and
    3.22% through April.
This year Canyon’s returns in bank debt and
    high-yield, which account for the biggest chunk of the
    portfolio, are also outdoing their respective indices. The firm
    appears equally cautious and optimistic.
"We find ourselves in an environment characterized by a
    tug-of-war between stability (which encourages risk-taking) and
    fragility (which encourages caution)," Canyon wrote to
    investors on May 20. As a result, Canyon said that "the
    portfolio remains unlevered and credit shorts (via CDS) are
    near all-time highs."
Canyon has five hedge funds. The onshore version of the
    flagship fund was launched in 1993, followed by the addition of
    its offshore counterpart in 1995. Prior to 1993
    Canyon’s hedge fund activities consisted solely of
    separately managed accounts. The flagship has a broad mandate
    that allows it to invest opportunistically across a wide
    variety of asset classes, as does the $1.5 billion Canyon
    Balanced Fund, which was launched in 2004 and has the
    distinction that it can invest in a more concentrated way in
    strategies with more equitylike returns. The
    firm’s remaining funds are the Canyon Distressed
    Opportunity Fund, a pure distressed credit fund; Canyon Capital
    Arbitrage Fund, a convertible and equity arbitrage strategy;
    and Canyon Special Opportunities Fund, a limited-life fund that
    has run its course and will return capital to investors by June
    30. In addition, the firm runs a number of separately managed
    accounts.

          manager Allen Ba and Patrick Dooley,
          Canyon’s director of research 





The firm also has a controversial real
    estate–lending portfolio. While not part of its hedge
    funds and less than 10% of the firm’s overall
    assets, that group’s capital structure
    approach—and its focus on originating its own
    deals—has also had a downside. A couple of its loans
    led to lawsuits, with accusations of unfair lending
    practices.
Distressed mortgages make up a big portion of
    Canyon’s business these days. But
    there’s nothing distressed about
    Canyon’s flashy address: 2000 Avenue of the Stars,
    Los Angeles. Built on property that was formerly the home of
    20th Century Fox Studios, the 175,000-square-foot structure,
    which was completed in 2008, looks like a futuristic ice cube
    with a hole in the middle. Behind it are two triangular
    high-rises known as the Century Park Towers. In
    Canyon’s luxurious new digs, where it has resided
    for three years, the fund is surrounded by stars: The Creative
    Artists Agency, which represents such Hollywood A-list names as
    Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney and Steven Spielberg, is on the
    floor below.
Unlike New York, where hedge fund managers are treated like
    kings, Los Angeles is a place where the Canyon founders can
    toil in virtual obscurity. That’s how they like
    it; the fund’s West Coast presence has helped keep
    Canyon among the most secretive of hedge funds. The pair also
    argue it allows them to think differently from the New York
    pack.
"Being in California gives us a little bit of freshness in
    the way we approach things. While we miss some things because
    we aren’t headquartered in the middle of Manhattan
    or Greenwich, I think we pick up a lot more than welose," says
    Friedman. Distance from the world’s largest hedge
    fund hub has also enabled Canyon to attract and hang on to
    professionals who want to make it home in time for dinner with
    their families. Unlike hedge funds based in the New York
    metropolitan area, Canyon faces few competitors that can lure
    its talent away.
To hear Canyon’s founders tell it, their hedge
    fund partnership might never have happened if Bronx,
    N.Y.–born Julis hadn’t put such
    importance on his childhood friendships, declining the
    opportunity to attend Harvard University and instead choosing
    Princeton University because that’s where his best
    friend since grade school had been accepted.
Another close friendship led Julis to alter his longtime law
    school career path for a joint degree in business and law at
    Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. Once there, he
    met Friedman, who had just received his undergraduate degree in
    physics at Harvard.
Julis had initially envisioned himself an international
    lawyer, perhaps specializing in Soviet studies, and Friedman
    imagined working in the tech corridor that surrounds Route 128
    outside Boston. Those plans were upended when Julis took a
    summer internship with a bankruptcy firm in Los Angeles, where
    he assisted the firm’s attorneys on cases
    involving entertainers like Tom Petty.
Unhappy working as a lawyer, Julis began writing magazine
    articles in his spare time about the creative ways bankruptcy
    was being used in the entertainment industry to revitalize
    debt-burdened companies. "I was basically sending messages in a
    bottle saying, 'Somebody save me from this
    career,’" says Julis. An assignment to write an
    article for Los Angeles Magazine on getting rich in a
    recession—it was 1982—led him to interview
    Henry Wilf, a Drexel employee whose name he had come across in
    an article on distressed investing. Wilf, who served as the
    retail liaison between Milken’s department and the
    Drexel system, quickly assessed that Julis was not a journalist
    and suggested that Drexel should be interviewing Julis
    instead.

Equities (54%)

Equity investments usually consist of the purchase of stock from a publicly-traded corporation. Companies pay their investors dividends to reward their investments and the value of the stock increases with expectations of later dividends. Equity investments are usually high interest yielding but carry a larger amount of risk than more steady investments.
Large/Mid-Cap Equity
Large-cap equity consists of equity invested in companies with stated assets greater than $10 billion. Mid-cap equity consists of equity invested in companies with stated assets greater than $2 billion but less than $10 billion. Large-cap equities are more stable investments than other types of equity, due to the stability and permanence of large companies. Because of this, large-cap equities have less risk than other equity investments but also tend to have a lower annual return. Mid-cap equities are more risky than large-cap equities, but less risky than small-cap equities.
