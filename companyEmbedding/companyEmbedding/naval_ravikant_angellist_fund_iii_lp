We’re thrilled with the reaction to episode #1, particularly given the historical dearth of LP content and other resources available to navigate and understand this important part of the startup ecosystem. The feedback we’ve received from founders has also been especially encouraging (and even a bit surprising) — We hope this podcast will be useful for the community at large (not just VCs).In the upcoming episodes, which we plan to release every 2 weeks, we’ll be interviewing people like Chris Douvos at VIA, Michael Kim at Cendana Capital, Josh Abramson, Joelle Kayden at Accolade Partners, among a number of other fantastic LPs.Naval Ravikant — Founder, AngelListThis episode was one of our favorites, as any time spent with Naval tends to encourage new ways of thinking and analysis. As the founder of AngelList, Naval has an incredible view into each aspect of the startup ecosystem, from founders starting new companies, to VCs, all the way up the stack to the LPs that allocate capital behind angels using AngelList’s syndicates product.In this episode, we discuss the changing early stage venture landscape, Naval’s experience starting a venture fund in 2008, all of the incredible things that AngelList is doing today (and plans to do) to systematically remove inefficiencies in the startup ecosystem, and lots of interesting things in between. We hope you’ll listen, subscribe, and let us know if you have any feedback.— Nick + AlexShare14Never miss a story from Notation Capital, when you sign up for Medium.

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D
Entreprenuer





I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
