(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, is designed to provide readers with narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may impact our future results.  Overview  Prior to November 19, 2016, we designed, manufactured, sold, and serviced flywheel-based uninterruptible power supply, or UPS, products that use kinetic energy to provide short-term power as a cleaner alternative to conventional electro-chemical battery-based energy storage. We also designed, manufactured, sold, and serviced modular infrastructure solutions, or MIS, that integrate critical power components into a pre-packaged, purpose-built enclosure that may include our UPS products as a component. On November 19, 2016 we sold this business and substantially all of our assets to Langley Holdings plc, a United Kingdom public limited company, and Piller USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Langley. In this annual report, we refer to Langley and its subsidiaries, including Piller USA, Inc. (now Piller Power Systems, Inc.), collectively as Langley. We refer to the business we sold to Langley as our discontinued operations.  After the closing of the disposition of our assets to Langley, we retained approximately $1.6 million in cash, which equaled the amount by which the value of the acquired assets exceeded the assumed liabilities on our balance sheet by more than $5.0 million at closing. We incurred a loss on the sale of the discontinued operations of approximately $6.6 million. We also retained our net operating losses and other tax benefits and certain intellectual property rights related to our patents that are not related to the purchased assets. We currently have no active operations and only two executive employees. Our continuing business will be primarily to monetize our retained intellectual property and to make acquisitions of profitable operating companies to create positive cash flow. We refer to our remaining operations as our continuing operations. Following the asset sale to Langley, we changed our name from Active Power, Inc. to P10 Industries, Inc.  The financial statements included in this report as of an for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 reflect the sale to Langley, by identifying assets and liabilities that were sold and assumed, and identifying income and expenses allocated to our discontinued operations and continuing operations. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Because our business during the 2016 and 2015 fiscal years consisted primarily of the discontinued operations, the following discussion of our results of operation focuses on these discontinued operations.  Results of Continuing Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated no revenue from our continuing operations and incurred general and administrative expenses associated with general corporate overhead of $1.4 million in 2016 and $1.3 million in 2015.  We have deemed that our general corporate overhead costs prior to the sale to Langley included twenty percent of the payroll and benefits for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, through his departure in July 2016, related to their services in support of our corporate governance. We also included costs associated with our directors and officers liability insurance, board of director's fees, investor relations, audit, U.S. tax preparation and disclosure fees, franchise tax, and SEC filing fees. The operating expenses of our continuing operations incurred after the sale to Langley include the full salaries and benefits of our two executive employees, legal costs, consulting costs associated with the monetization of our retained intellectual property and other general administrative expenses. All costs associated with the sale of the discontinued operations have been classified as loss on disposal.  Results of Discontinued Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Set forth below are our revenues and costs and expenses for the discontinued operations for the fiscal years 2016 and 2015. This information should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in this report. Our fiscal 2016 results include operations through November 18, 2016, the day before the sale of our discontinued operations to Langley, and therefore do not contain the full twelve months of operations reflected in the fiscal 2015 results. As a result, the fiscal 2016 results reflect six fewer weeks, or an 11.5% reduction in the operating period, than fiscal 2015.

Our product revenue was derived from the following sources: Year Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2016 2015 $ change % change Product revenue: UPS product revenue $ 17,994 $ 31,046 $ (13,052 ) (42 )% Modular Infrastructure Solutions 3,230 12,201 (8,971 ) (74 )% Total product revenue $ 21,224 $ 43,247 $ (22,023 ) (51 )%  Total product revenue for fiscal 2016 was $21.2 million, compared to $43.2 million for fiscal 2015, a $22.0 million decrease. The decrease in our product revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily came from lower bookings in 2016 as a result of customers deferring delivery of previously placed orders and delaying the placement of new orders along with a large order from an IT channel partner not repeating in 2016 and the shorter operating period. In 2016, 85% of our product revenue came from the sale of UPS systems and 15% from the sale of MIS products. Sales of our UPS products decreased by approximately $13.1 million, or 42%, compared to 2015 as we saw decreased demand from key customers during the 2016.  Product revenue from our OEM channel for fiscal 2016 was $5.4 million, compared to $11.2 million in 2015, a $5.8 million decrease or 52%. The size and volume of orders from our OEM channel fluctuated significantly on a quarterly basis, and we received a smaller number of large transactions from our OEM channel in 2016. Sales to Caterpillar, our primary OEM customer, represented 20% of our total revenue (including services) for fiscal 2016 compared to 25% in fiscal 2015. We supported our OEM partners' efforts to sell total solutions to their customers, which included generators and switchgear that they manufacture along with our UPS products as a total solution.  Product revenue from our IT channel partner for fiscal 2016 was $1.6 million, compared to $10.2 million in 2015, a decrease of $8.5 million or 84%. This decrease reflects larger orders for our MIS products during 2015 from our IT channel partner Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HPE. The level of orders fluctuated depending on HPE's success and need for modular infrastructure solutions. Total sales (including services) to HPE represented 8% and 18% of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively.  Product revenue in North and South America was $13.5 million, a decrease of $18.6 million, or 58%, compared to $32.1 million for 2015. Our revenue in this region decreased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily as a result of declines in demand from Caterpillar and HPE, which are located in the United States.  Product revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa decreased by approximately $4.1 million, or 43%, to $5.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $9.5 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease is due to lower direct UPS sales in the region.  Our product revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased by 36%, or $0.6 million, in 2016 to $2.2 million compared to $1.6 million in 2015. This increase is primarily due to higher UPS sales in the region.  Service and other revenue from discontinued operations. Service and other revenue decreased by approximately $3.6 million, or 26%, to $10.5 million in fiscal 2016 from $14.2 million in fiscal 2015. This decrease primarily reflects lower sales of spare parts, a reduction in revenue from new equipment startups and a reduction in service contract revenue associated with the reduced operating period in 2016.  Cost of product revenue from discontinued operations. The cost of product revenue as a percentage of total product revenue was 81% and 74% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cost as a percentage of revenue was related to lower manufacturing absorption associated with the decreased production in 2016. During 2016 and 2015, we operated a manufacturing facility that had a manufacturing and testing capacity significantly greater than what was required by our product revenue levels. Our manufacturing operational costs included a large portion of fixed costs relative to our operational needs. We expensed the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues.  Cost of service and other revenue from discontinued operations. The cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of total service and other revenue increased by 2%, to 63%, in 2016 compared to 61% in 2015. The increase in cost as a percentage of revenue reflects higher unabsorbed costs associated with the 26% service revenue decline.  Gross profit from discontinued operations. Our gross profit was 25% of revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to 29% in fiscal 2015. This margin decrease was due to higher unabsorbed costs associated with lower revenue. We implemented additional cost control measures in 2016, including one week of unpaid furlough per quarter for all U.S. based employees, curtailed overtime and reduced contract labor, but those measures were insufficient to offset the revenue decline.  Research and development from discontinued operations. Research and development expenses were approximately $4.1 million in 2016, a reduction of approximately $1.6 million, or 28%, from the approximately $5.7 million in expenses in fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due the 11.5% reduction in the operating period for 2016, cost control measures put in place, including one week of unpaid furlough each quarter for all U.S. based employees, lower product development costs and lower bonus expense of $0.2 million which was partially offset by $0.2 million higher stock compensation expense.  Selling and marketing from discontinued operations. Selling and marketing costs were approximately $7.3 million in 2016, a reduction of approximately $3.2 million, or 31%, from the approximately $10.6 million in expenses in fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the 11.5% reduction in the operating period during 2016, cost control measures put in place, including one week of unpaid furlough each quarter for all U.S. based employees, and $0.9 million lower commissions on reduced bookings, offset partially by $0.2 million higher stock compensation expense.  General and administrative from discontinued operations. General and administrative expenses were approximately $4.0 million in fiscal 2016, a reduction of approximately $1.3 million, or 24%, from the approximately $5.2 million in expenses in fiscal 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the 11.5% reduction in the operating period during 2016, cost control measures  put in place including one week of unpaid furlough each quarter and lower bonus expense of $1.2 million, offset partially by $0.8 million higher stock compensation expense.  Loss on sale of discontinued operations. We incurred a loss on the sale of our discontinued operations as the result of the sale of assets in excess of liabilities of $5.0 million for a nominal amount. In addition, we accrued approximately $1.2 million to settle our outstanding lease obligations, we wrote off approximately $0.2 million of cumulative translation adjustments associated with our divested foreign subsidiaries and we incurred $0.2 million of transaction costs, net of shared expenses with Langley.  Interest expense, net from discontinued operations. Net interest expense was $0.3 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $0.4 million in 2015. The interest expense incurred during 2016 and 2015 was in connection with the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. The debt outstanding on this facility was repaid at the closing of the sale of our discontinued operations to Langley, resulting in the debt being outstanding for a shorter period of time, and therefore, lower expense in 2016.  Other income (expense), net from discontinued operations. Other income (expense), net was $19,000 in fiscal 2016 and $24,000 in fiscal 2015, a decrease of $5,000 or 21%. This decrease primarily reflects foreign exchange losses or gains on settlement of intercompany balances and sales contracts held in foreign currencies.  Income tax expense from discontinued operations. We had no income tax expense in 2016 or 2015.  We consider an accounting policy to be critical if:   the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate; and   changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  Our management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. In addition, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined above. Changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements.  Revenue recognition  We recognized revenue for our discontinued operations when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In general, revenue is recognized when revenue-generating transactions fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition:   We recognized product revenue at the time of shipment for a significant portion of all products sold directly to customers and through distributors because title and risk of loss typically pass on delivery to the common carrier. Our customers and distributors did not have the right to return products. We sometimes entered into bill-and-hold arrangements and when this occurred delivery may not be present, but other criteria were reviewed to determine proper timing of revenue recognition.   Unless performed under a maintenance agreement, we recognized installation, service and maintenance revenue at the time the service is performed.   We recognized revenue associated with maintenance agreements over the life of the contracts using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition were recorded as a current liability in the deferred revenue line of the consolidated balance sheet or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.   We recognized revenue on certain rental programs over the life of the rental agreements using the straight-line method. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.   Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.  Multiple element arrangements or MEAs are arrangements to sell products to customers that frequently include multiple deliverables. Our most significant MEAs included the sale of one or more of our CleanSource UPS or CleanSource PowerHouse products, combined with one or more of the following products or services: design services, project management, commissioning and installation services, spare parts or consumables, and maintenance agreements. Delivery of the various products or performance  of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide. Certain services related to design and consulting may occur prior to product delivery. Commissioning and installation typically take place within six months of product delivery, depending upon customer requirements. Maintenance agreements, consumables, and repair, maintenance or consulting services generally are delivered over a period of one to five years.  When arrangements included multiple elements, we allocated revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements had standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met. We established the selling price of each element based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence, or VSOE, if available, Third Party Evidence, or TPE, if VSOE is not available, or Best Estimate of Selling Price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. We generally determined selling price based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements. When arrangements included a maintenance agreement, we recognized revenue related to the maintenance agreement at the relative selling price on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.  Any taxes imposed by governmental authorities on our revenue-producing transactions with customers are shown in our consolidated statement of operations on a net-basis; that is, excluded from our reported revenues.  Inventories  Inventories are priced at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or market. We estimated inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow-moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products, the impact of new product introductions, inventory turns and specific identification of items, such as product discontinuance, damaged goods or engineering/material changes.  Warranty liability  Estimated warranty liability costs were accrued for each of our products at the time of sale. Our estimates were principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product, including when little or no claims experience may exist. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates, changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results. Our estimate of warranty liability was reevaluated on a quarterly basis. Experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product and component failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures; therefore our process relied upon long-term historical averages until actual data is available. As actual experience becomes available, it was used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes. The resulting balances were then compared to current spending rates to help ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations.  Stock-based compensation  Stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected option life and forfeiture rates. We develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time. A small change in estimates used can have a relatively large impact on the estimated valuation.  We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards. We estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility. Estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary source of liquidity at December 31, 2016 was our cash on hand of approximately $1.6 million. We have no credit facility and no operations that could be the source of additional cash. However, we are in the process of reviewing how we could monetize the intellectual property we retained after the sale of our discontinued operations to Langley. We do not currently have estimates of the amount or timing of the cash we may receive from this potential source. We are in negotiations with several potential investors to raise funds through the sales of our equity securities. We expect that these funds would fund our ongoing operating expenses as well as investments in profitable business acquisitions. We expect that any such acquisitions would also involve borrowings under credit facilities.  If we meet our cost projections, we expect that we will have adequate capital resources to continue operating for at least the next twelve months. Our projections and our assumptions around the adequacy of our liquidity are based on estimates regarding expected future costs. These costs are currently limited to two executive employees and corporate overhead. However, there are  scenarios in which our costs may exceed our estimates or we could face unexpected claims, including costs associated with a lease for our former headquarters, for which we remain responsible. Further, our estimates may change and future events or developments may also affect our estimates. Any of these factors may change our expectation of cash usage in fiscal 2017 and beyond, or significantly affect our level of liquidity.  If we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders could be significantly diluted. If we obtain additional debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness, and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations. We do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding, or funding on terms acceptable to us, to continue our operations as planned.  We are currently in negotiations with Langley, the landlord and other potential tenants in an effort to reduce our obligations under the lease. We are also in discussions with a potential investor that has indicated that it is contemplating an investment in shares of our common stock. However, the investor has indicated that it would be a condition to the closing of its investment that we make a filing under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a prepackaged plan. The prepackaged plan would provide for the issuance of the shares of our common stock to the potential investor in a manner which would not make the rights under our stockholders rights plan exercisable . In addition, the prepackaged plan would also provide for the settlement our lease obligation. We do not have a definitive agreement with the potential investor, and we cannot assure you that the transactions described above will be consummated.  Significant uses of cash  Operating Activities  The following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities (in thousands):   Annual Change from Percent Year Amount Prior Year Change 2016 $ (7,169 ) $ (5,590 ) (354 )% 2015 $ (1,579 ) $ 5,649 78 %  Cash used in operating activities was approximately $7.2 million in fiscal 2016 compared to approximately $1.6 million in 2015. The increase in cash used in operating activities in fiscal 2016 was primarily related to our net loss from continuing operations of $1.4 million and cash used by our discontinued operations of $5.7 million which included the loss on discontinued operations of $7.8 million partially offset by stock based compensation of approximately $2.7 million. Changes in our net working capital resulted in cash used of approximately $1.3 million in 2016, compared to cash provided of approximately $2.5 million in 2015.  Investing Activities  Investing activities primarily consisted of the sale of our discontinued operations and the purchases of property and equipment for our discontinued . . .

P10 Industries, Inc. Gives Update On Status Of Stock Trading






GlobeNewswire



Jun 7, 2017 6:08 PM EDT













 


















































 DALLAS, June 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- P10 Industries, Inc. (OTC:PIOE), formerly Active Power, Inc., today announced that a market maker has filed a Form 211 under section 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is now awaiting approval from FINRA.  Once that approval is provided, trading in the P10 Industries stock on the OTC Pink market may commence. "I know everyone is patiently waiting for FINRA approval of the Form 211 filing so that PIOE can move from the 'gray market' to trade on OTC 'Pink,'" said Mark A. Ascolese CEO of P10 Industries.  "As we previously announced, the financial condition of P10 Industries is stable, we have received the $4.5 million financing from P10/210 Investment LLC and are executing on our plan, which was approved by the bankruptcy court on May 5 th.  We will announce the FINRA approval as soon as we become aware of it." Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking and are based upon the company's current belief as to the outcome and timing of future events. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, that address activities that the company plans, expects, believes, projects, estimates or anticipates will, should or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements.  Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements herein include, but are not limited to, the ability to implement the company's business plan and known trends and uncertainties, as described in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the company's actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
