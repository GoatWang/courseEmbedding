Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; IDEAL TOY GETS A NEW PRESIDENT


By Leonard Sloane


Published: May 27, 1981









                    Joseph C. Winkler has been elected president of the Ideal Toy Corporation. He succeeds Lionel A. Weintraub, who remains chairman and chief executive officer of the big toy company with headquarters in Hollis, Queens.        

                    ''We've got some modifications of product lines that have to be worked on,'' Mr. Winkler said in a telephone interview. ''There will be a return to a more balanced product line, a return to nonadvertised merchandise and greater utilization of domestic manufacturing. Marketing has to play a larger role in determining product direction than it has in the past.''        

                    In the fiscal year ended Jan. 29, 1981, Ideal lost $15.5 million on sales of $141.4 million, in contrast to earnings of $3.7 million on revenues of $159.6 million the year before. ''We're improving this year over what happened last year,'' Mr. Winkler asserted. ''Some of the shocks of high interest costs and combined inflation and recession have been absorbed since then.''        

                    Mr. Winkler, now 65 years old, joined Ideal in 1956 as controller, and he became vice president for finance six years later. He has been executive vice president since 1979. He said other executives in the Ideal organization would ''move up'' soon.        

                    Mr. Weintraub, 61, a son-in-law of a nephew of Ideal's founder, came to the company in 1941 as a summer trainee. He became first vice president in 1952, president in 1962 and chairman three years ago.        

                    At the annual American Toy Fair in February, Ideal ''introduced a lot more moderately priced products, which seemed to be our problem last year,'' Mr. Winkler said. ''And we introduced a lot more basic items - that's part of our direction. But the industry is not out of the woods.''
