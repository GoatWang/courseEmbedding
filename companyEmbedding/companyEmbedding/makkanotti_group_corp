Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
Registration Statement is $7,500, which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Anna Ioannou, our
president and director has agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the
registration process, implement business plan, and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board or other quotation service. Also, the loans
would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to
implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the
OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for
trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Ioannou will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due
date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms. Ioannou. Ms. Ioannou will be
repaid from revenues of operations when we generate significant revenues to pay
the obligation in full amount.


The Company faces strong from Powerofart www.powerofart.net, NIKYR PRODUCTS & CO
LTD www.nikyr.com. There are many barriers of entry in the paper bags market.
These barriers include need for the capital to start up; customer loyalty when
large manufacturing firms may have existing customers loyal to established
products or exclusive agreements with key links in the supply chain could make
it difficult for other manufacturers to enter an industry. We need proceeds from
this offering to enter this business. We will be in a market where we compete
with other companies offering similar products. We will be in direct competition
with them. Many of these companies may have a greater, more established customer
base than us. We will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of
these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for paper bags than
us, which may also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face
challenges from new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete
effectively with these existing or new competitors, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Makkanotti Group Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market
penetration to date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many
participants in the paper bags manufacturing business. Many established,
well-financed entities are currently active in the market. Nearly all Makkanotti
Group Corp.'s competitors have significantly greater financial resources,
technical expertise, and managerial capabilities than Makkanotti Group Corp. We
are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such
products and become a successful company in the paper bag industry. Therefore,
Makkanotti Group Corp. might not be able to establish itself within the industry
at all.


Company Description

field of manufacturing paper bags. The paper bags can be used for fruits,
bakery, packaging. Our target markets are supermarkets, kiosks, cafes and

expand it to nearest municipalities, such as Lakatamia, Strovolos, and

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT' DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE  Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of  The Company approved a 3.6-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, payable as a dividend as of July 21, 2016. As a result of the forward split, the Company now has 24,984,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock which has been retroactively accounted for.  Financial information contained in this quarterly report and in our unaudited condensed interim financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  GENERAL  Makkanotti Group Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.  As a result of a private transaction on June 28, 2016, the control block of stock of this company, represented by 5,000,000 shares of common stock, has been sold by Anna Ioannou and a change of control of the Company occurred. Contemporaneously with the aforementioned private transaction, Anna Ioannou, the existing sole director and officer, resigned as the director, president, chief executive and treasurer of the Company. Upon the resignation of Anna Ioannou, Michael Hlavsa was appointed as the Company's sole director, president, secretary and treasurer. There are no transactions to which the Company is a party and in which Mr. Hlavsa has a direct or indirect material interest that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.  Our product  The main product of the Company's manufacturing process is a paper bag. Paper bags are generally used in all supermarkets, fruit kiosks, bakeries and cafes and other places and in everyday life. Grocery bags are ideal for carrying food products and are an environmentally friendly choice as they are made from recyclable materials. The Company in a development stage of business is planning to manufacture two types of paper bags, such as flat bottom paper bags and strung in the corner paper bags. Paper bags are used widely by children as tuck-shop bags or lunch bags, also in supermarkets for storing different kind of fruits and vegetables, in bakeries, cafes, and restaurants for packing food.  Equipment  We have purchased one paper food bag-forming machine RUITAI KTPM-A for $6,000 from a Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". This model is user-friendly and simple in operating. The regular preventive maintenance of the machine will be fulfilled by a specialist, who we are planning to hire in the future.  Also in December 2015, we bought one printing machine for $2,278 from the same Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". It lets us make exclusive paper bags with different images on them.  Marketing of paper bags  Our sole officer and director will be responsible for marketing of our products. The Company is planning to contact a marketing specialist for promotion. Currently we do not have any agreements with any marketing specialists. We intend to use marketing tools, such as web and newspaper advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We believe that one of the most powerful aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a high degree of accuracy and cost effective way.  Table of Contents  Industry analysis  Makkanotti Group Corp. is planning to expand its business in the nearest municipalities, such as Lakatamia and Strovolos in Cyprus. In any city we plan to expand our operations to where there are many different supermarkets, fruit kiosks, sweets kiosks and bakeries that may be interested in cooperation with the Company. We offer high-quality and inexpensive products, which can satisfy any client requirements. Besides such kind of distribution network we plan to sign agreements with distributors of similar products. We are planning to offer a commission from sales to our potential partners. We also plan to have a special section on our website for potential partners with examples of our products and offers for wholesale clients and partners.  Storage and delivery of paper bags  The product produced by Makkanotti Group Corp. does not require any storage facilities as it will be manufactured directly for each order. The number of demonstration samples will be kept is insignificant and does not require any special premises for storage. Our machines will be located at our leased premise in Nicosia, Cyprus. Term of manufacturing will depend on customer's order.  Contracts and negotiation with customers  To the date the Company has entered into Agreement for Sale of Goods with "Epidorpio Confectionery" Bakery, who has agreed to buy our paper bags for packing its flour products and Agreement for Sale of Goods with "A&G KOKKINOU LTD.". The Company is also planning to contact G.I. MONADIKON LTD www.monadikon.com, Qboo Bakehouse and The Xechoron Trading Company LTD in regard of future cooperation.  Insurance  We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.  Employees  We are in a development stage and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director.  Office  Our office located at Larnakos Avenue, 73, ap. 402, Nicosia, Cyprus 1046. Our phone number is +1 (407) 720-5503.  Government Regulation  We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015  Our revenues for the three months period ended June 30, 2016 were $7,600; Cost of Sales was $829, and Gross Profit was $6,771. During the comparable period for the three months ending June 30, 2015, we had revenues of $5,905, Cost of Sales of $912, and Gross Profit of $4,993.  Table of Contents  During the three month period ending June 30, 2016, our general and administrative expenses were $17,439 which consisted primarily of fees paid to be DTC eligible in the amount of $10,000 and legal and professional fees of $5,675. For the comparable period in 2015, the general and administrative expenses were $4,829 which primarily consisted of legal and professional fees.  Our net losses for the three month periods ended June 30, 2016 was $10,668. During the three months ended June 30, 2015 the Company had a net profit of $164.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016  As of June 30, 2016 our total assets were $10,401. Total assets were comprised of current assets of cash $389, inventory $2,484 and prepaid expenses $1,100; and net Fixed assets $6,428.  As of June 30, 2016 our current liabilities were $11,032, comprised of loan from a former officer and founder. Stockholder's deficit was $631.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the three month period ended June 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $11,322.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  For three month period ended June 30, 2016, there were no net cash flows related to investing activities.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  For the three month period ended June 30, 2016, cash flows provided by financing activities was $7,000 through the proceeds from loan from a former officer and founder.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve month period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of shares of our common stock. We may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors or unrelated parties.  GOING CONCERN  The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $25,031 at June 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARANGEMENTS  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	NOTES TO 

	CONDENSED

	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	SEPTEMBER 30, 2016




	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	Makkanotti Group Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus


	 



	NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 




	Basis of Presentation




	The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in Form 10-K for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on June 24, 2016.


	 




	Use of Estimates




	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Property and Equipment




	Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and replacements and betterments are capitalized. The range of estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation for principal items of property and equipment are as follows:


	 










	Asset Category








	Useful Life





	 






	Furniture and fixtures








	3 years




	 






	Office equipment








	3 years




	 






	Computer software








	5 years




	 






	 


	We periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value. We recorded no impairment on our long-lived assets during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	Revenue generated from providing the sale of goods and services.


	 


	Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our goods and services have been provided, all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, and collection is reasonably assured. No guarantees or warranties are provided for the goods or services we render. Due to the nature of the goods and services provided and method of billing and collection, we do not offer a refund policy.

	NOTES TO 

	CONDENSED

	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	SEPTEMBER 30, 2016




	(UNAUDITED)




	 


	Revenue from sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the end customer and collectability is reasonably assured.


	 


	If payments for revenues are received prior to the products being shipped or services being rendered, those revenues, and costs directly associated with such revenues, are deferred until such time as the product or services are provided.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.


	 




	Fair Value Measurements




	 


	The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.


	 


	The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.


	 


	ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


	 


	Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


	 


	Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable


	 


	Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)


	 


	The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis.


	 





	Loss Per Share





	 


	The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, 

	Earnings per Share.

	 Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding.


	 




	Recently Issued Standards




	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted except for limited provisions. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  The Company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.


	 


	The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 4 – LOAN PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY

	GENERAL



	 


	Makkanotti Group Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.


	 


	As a result of a private transaction on June 28, 2016, the control block of stock of this company, represented by 5,000,000 shares of common stock, has been sold by Anna Ioannou and a change of control of the Company occurred. Contemporaneously with the aforementioned private transaction, Anna Ioannou, the existing sole director and officer, resigned as the director, president, chief executive and treasurer of the Company. Upon the resignation of Anna Ioannou, Michael Hlavsa was appointed as the Company's sole director, president, secretary and treasurer. There are no transactions to which the Company is a party and in which Mr. Hlavsa has a direct or indirect material interest that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.


	 





	Our product





	 


	The main product of the Company's manufacturing process is a paper bag. Paper bags are generally used in all supermarkets, fruit kiosks, bakeries and cafes and other places and in everyday life. Grocery bags are ideal for carrying food products and are an environmentally friendly choice as they are made from recyclable materials. The Company in a development stage of business is planning to manufacture two types of paper bags, such as flat bottom paper bags and strung in the corner paper bags. Paper bags are used widely by children as tuck-shop bags or lunch bags, also in supermarkets for storing different kind of fruits and vegetables, in bakeries, cafés, and restaurants for packing food.

	Equipment





	 


	We have purchased one paper food bag-forming machine

	RUITAI KTPM-A

	for $6,000 from a Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". This model is user-friendly and simple in operating. The regular preventive maintenance of the machine will be fulfilled by a specialist, who we are planning to hire in the future.


	 


	Also in December 2015, we bought one printing machine for $2,278 from the same Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". It lets us make exclusive paper bags with different images on them.


	 





	Marketing of paper bags





	 


	Our sole officer and director will be responsible for marketing of our products. The Company is planning to contact a marketing specialist for promotion. Currently we do not have any agreements with any marketing specialists. We intend to use marketing tools, such as web and newspaper advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We believe that one of the most powerful aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a high degree of accuracy and cost effective way.


	 





	Industry analysis





	 


	Makkanotti Group Corp. is planning to expand its business in the nearest municipalities, such as Lakatamia and Strovolos in Cyprus. In any city we plan to expand our operations to where there are many different supermarkets, fruit kiosks, sweets kiosks and bakeries that may be interested in cooperation with the Company. We offer high-quality and inexpensive products, which can satisfy any client requirements. Besides such kind of distribution network we plan to sign agreements with distributors of similar products. We are planning to offer a commission from sales to our potential partners. We also plan to have a special section on our website for potential partners with examples of our products and offers for wholesale clients and partners.


	 





	Storage and delivery of paper bags





	 


	The product produced by Makkanotti Group Corp. does not require any storage facilities as it will be manufactured directly for each order. The number of demonstration samples will be kept is insignificant and does not require any special premises for storage. Our machines will be located at our leased premise in Nicosia, Cyprus. Term of manufacturing will depend on customer's order.


	 





	Contracts and negotiation with customers





	 


	To the date the Company has entered into Agreement for Sale of Goods with "Epidorpio Confectionery" Bakery, who has agreed to buy our paper bags for packing its flour products and Agreement for Sale of Goods with "A&G KOKKINOU LTD.". The Company is also planning to contact G.I. MONADIKON LTD www.monadikon.com, Qboo Bakehouse and The Xechoron Trading Company LTD in regard of future cooperation.

	Insurance





	 


	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.


	 





	Employees





	 


	We are in a development stage and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director who does not receive any compensation.

	Government Regulation

We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 



	SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016



	 


	As of September 30, 2016 we did not have any assets.


	 


	As of September 30, 2016 our current liabilities were $8,352, comprised of accounts payable. Stockholder's deficit was $8,352.


	 



	CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES

	PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING



	 


	The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve month period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of shares of our common stock. We may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors or unrelated parties

	GOING CONCERN



	 


	The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $33,336 at September 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.


	  



	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARANGEMENTS



	 


	As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.



	 






	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.




	 


	None



	 






	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 


	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 using the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").


	 


	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.


	 







	 




	1.




	We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management's view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company's financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management's activities.





	 




	 




	13














	Table of Contents





	 







	 




	2.




	We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company's bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.





	 


	 


	 





	 




	3.




	We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As at September 30, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company's data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.




	 

	Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls.


	 


	As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.


	 




	Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting




	 


	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, that occurred during our first fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.


	 


	This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.

(the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus. NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not contain all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual financial statements. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included in Form S-1 for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2016 filed with the SEC on June 24, 2016. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues, costs and expenses during the reporting period. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on a regular basis. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets using principally the straight-line method. When items are retired or otherwise disposed of, income is charged or credited for the difference between net book value and proceeds realized thereon. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and replacements and betterments are capitalized. The range of estimated useful lives used to calculate depreciation for principal items of property and equipment are as follows:  Asset Category Useful Life Furniture and fixtures 3 yearsOffice equipment 3 yearsComputer software 5 years We periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be fully recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value and its book value. We recorded no impairment on our long-lived assets during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.   6Table of Contents  MAKKANOTTI GROUP CORP.NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJUNE 30, 2016(UNAUDITED) Revenue Recognition Revenue generated from providing the sale of goods and services.  Revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our goods and services have been provided, all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, and collection is reasonably assured. No guarantees or warranties are provided for the goods or services we render. Due to the nature of the good and services provided and method of billing and collection, we do not offer a refund policy.  Revenue from sales is recognized when the product is shipped to the end customer and collectability is reasonable assured.  If payments for revenues are received prior to the products being shipped or services being rendered, those revenues, and costs directly associated with such revenues, are deferred until such time as the product or services are provided. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of June 30, 2016, the Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.  Fair Value Measurements The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures", which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable Level 3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions) The Company has no assets or liabilities valued at fair value on a recurring basis. Loss Per Share The Company computes basic and diluted earnings per share amounts in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if stock options and other commitments to issue common stock were exercised or equity awards vest resulting in the issuance of common stock that could share in the earnings of the Company. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments outstanding.   7Table of Contents  MAKKANOTTI GROUP CORP.NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSJUNE 30, 2016(UNAUDITED) Recently Issued Standards In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The purpose is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is not permitted except for limited provisions. The Company does not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations. There are various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. NOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $25,031 at June 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. NOTE 4 – LOAN PAYABLE – RELATED PARTY During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $7,000 from a former officer and its founder resulting in $11,032 in total being owed as of June 30, 2016. The loans are non-interest bearing, have no set maturity date, and the Company intends to repay the loans as cash flow becomes available. NOTE 5 – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Authorized Stock The Company has authorized 75,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy, on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought. Common Share Issuances On March 16, 2015, the company issued a total of 5,000,000 common shares to its founder for a cash contribution of $4,982 in connection with a subscription agreement in the amount of $5,000. The difference between the subscription amount and the amount contributed has been recorded as a stock subscription receivable in the amount of $18. The subscription was received on April 30, 2015. During September 2015, the company issued a total of 1,940,000 common shares for cash contribution of $19,400 at $0.01 per share  There were 6,940,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016.  The Company approved a 3.6-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, payable as a dividend as of July 21, 2016. As a result of the forward split, the Company now has 24,984,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  NOTE 6 – CONCENTRATION Principally all of the revenues generated during three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were from one customer "Epidorpio Confectionery" Bakery.  NOTE 7 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  As disclosed in a Form 8-K filing on July 1, 2016, as a result of a private transaction on June 28, 2016, the control block of stock of this company, represented by 5,000,000 shares of common stock, has been sold by Anna Ioannou and a change of control of Makkanotti Group Corp. has occurred. Contemporaneously with the private transaction, Anna Ioannou, the existing sole director and officer, resigned as the director, president, chief executive and treasurer of the Company. Upon the resignation of Anna Ioannou, Michael Hlavsa was appointed as the Company's sole director, president, secretary and treasurer. The Company approved a 3.6-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, payable as a dividend as of July 21, 2016. As a result of the forward split, the Company now has 24,984,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock.  Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statement were available to be issued. Based on the evaluation no material events have occurred that require recognition in or disclosure to the financial statements other than those stated above.   8Table of Contents  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT' DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT NOTICE  Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. The Company approved a 3.6-for-1 forward stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, payable as a dividend as of July 21, 2016. As a result of the forward split, the Company now has 24,984,000 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock which has been retroactively accounted for.   Financial information contained in this quarterly report and in our unaudited condensed interim financial statements is stated in United States dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  GENERAL Makkanotti Group Corp. (the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus. As a result of a private transaction on June 28, 2016, the control block of stock of this company, represented by 5,000,000 shares of common stock, has been sold by Anna Ioannou and a change of control of the Company occurred. Contemporaneously with the aforementioned private transaction, Anna Ioannou, the existing sole director and officer, resigned as the director, president, chief executive and treasurer of the Company. Upon the resignation of Anna Ioannou, Michael Hlavsa was appointed as the Company's sole director, president, secretary and treasurer. There are no transactions to which the Company is a party and in which Mr. Hlavsa has a direct or indirect material interest that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K. Our product The main product of the Company's manufacturing process is a paper bag. Paper bags are generally used in all supermarkets, fruit kiosks, bakeries and cafes and other places and in everyday life. Grocery bags are ideal for carrying food products and are an environmentally friendly choice as they are made from recyclable materials. The Company in a development stage of business is planning to manufacture two types of paper bags, such as flat bottom paper bags and strung in the corner paper bags. Paper bags are used widely by children as tuck-shop bags or lunch bags, also in supermarkets for storing different kind of fruits and vegetables, in bakeries, cafés, and restaurants for packing food.  Equipment  We have purchased one paper food bag-forming machine RUITAI KTPM-A for $6,000 from a Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". This model is user-friendly and simple in operating. The regular preventive maintenance of the machine will be fulfilled by a specialist, who we are planning to hire in the future.  Also in December 2015, we bought one printing machine for $2,278 from the same Chinese company "Chinese Investment Services Company Limited". It lets us make exclusive paper bags with different images on them. Marketing of paper bags Our sole officer and director will be responsible for marketing of our products. The Company is planning to contact a marketing specialist for promotion. Currently we do not have any agreements with any marketing specialists. We intend to use marketing tools, such as web and newspaper advertisements, direct mailing, and phone calls to acquire potential customers. We believe that one of the most powerful aspects of online marketing is the ability to target our chosen group with a high degree of accuracy and cost effective way.    9Table of Contents  Industry analysis Makkanotti Group Corp. is planning to expand its business in the nearest municipalities, such as Lakatamia and Strovolos in Cyprus. In any city we plan to expand our operations to where there are many different supermarkets, fruit kiosks, sweets kiosks and bakeries that may be interested in cooperation with the Company. We offer high-quality and inexpensive products, which can satisfy any client requirements. Besides such kind of distribution network we plan to sign agreements with distributors of similar products. We are planning to offer a commission from sales to our potential partners. We also plan to have a special section on our website for potential partners with examples of our products and offers for wholesale clients and partners. Storage and delivery of paper bags The product produced by Makkanotti Group Corp. does not require any storage facilities as it will be manufactured directly for each order. The number of demonstration samples will be kept is insignificant and does not require any special premises for storage. Our machines will be located at our leased premise in Nicosia, Cyprus. Term of manufacturing will depend on customer's order. Contracts and negotiation with customers To the date the Company has entered into Agreement for Sale of Goods with "Epidorpio Confectionery" Bakery, who has agreed to buy our paper bags for packing its flour products and Agreement for Sale of Goods with "A&G KOKKINOU LTD.". The Company is also planning to contact G.I. MONADIKON LTD www.monadikon.com, Qboo Bakehouse and The Xechoron Trading Company LTD in regard of future cooperation.  Insurance We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party to a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations. Employees We are in a development stage and currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director.  Office Our office located at Larnakos Avenue, 73, ap. 402, Nicosia, Cyprus 1046. Our phone number is +1 (407) 720-5503. Government Regulation We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 Our revenues for the three months period ended June 30, 2016 were $7,600; Cost of Sales was $829, and Gross Profit was $6,771.

For the three month period ended June 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $11,322. CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  For three month period ended June 30, 2016, there were no net cash flows related to investing activities. CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  For the three month period ended June 30, 2016, cash flows provided by financing activities was $7,000 through the proceeds from loan from a former officer and founder.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time. Our cash reserves are not sufficient to meet our obligations for the next twelve month period. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of shares of our common stock. We may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors or unrelated parties.  GOING CONCERN  The Company has generated minimal revenues since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $25,031 at June 30, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to generate revenues and its ability to obtain capital from third parties. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARANGEMENTS  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.   11Table of Contents  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. None ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 using the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.   1.We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the management's view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Company's financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management's activities.    2.We did not maintain appropriate cash controls – As of June 30, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company's bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.    3.We did not implement appropriate information technology controls – As at June 30, 2016, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Company's data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.  Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls. As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016, that occurred during our first fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this quarterly report.   12Table of Contents  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our Company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. ITEM 1A.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
