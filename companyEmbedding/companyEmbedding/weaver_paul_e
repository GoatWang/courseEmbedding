Salesforce Company Executive Team - Salesforce.com





 
















Executive team

‹ Leadership




The Salesforce executive management team is made up of seasoned individuals who now seek to define Salesforce as a world-class company delivering enterprise software with cloud computing.
The executive management team at Salesforce is comprised of:

Marc Benioff, Chairman & CEO
Parker Harris, Co-Founder
Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO
Alex Dayon, President, Chief Product Officer
Suzanne DiBianca, Executive Vice President, Corporate Relations and Chief Philanthropy Officer
Corey duBrowa, Executive Vice President, Chief Communications Officer
Mark Hawkins, Chief Financial Officer
Maria Martinez, President, Global Customer Success and Salesforce Latin America
Elizabeth Pinkham, Executive Vice President, Global Real Estate
Tony Prophet, Chief Equality Officer
Cindy Robbins, Executive Vice President, Global Employee Success
Amy Weaver, President, Legal and General Counsel






Marc Benioff
Chairman & CEO

Marc Benioff is chairman and CEO of Salesforce. A pioneer of cloud computing, Benioff founded the company in 1999 with a vision to create a new kind of enterprise software company, with a new technology model based in the cloud, a new pay-as-you-go business model and a new integrated corporate philanthropy model. Under his leadership, Salesforce has grown from a groundbreaking idea into a Fortune 500 company, the fastest-growing top ten software company in the world and the largest CRM company.
For its revolutionary approach, Salesforce has been named one of the World’s Most Innovative Companies six years in a row by Forbes Magazine, one of Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies in the software industry five years in a row, and a Fortune Best Company to Work For nine years in a row.
Benioff has been widely recognized for his visionary leadership and pioneering innovations. He has been named one of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders by Fortune, 50 Most Influential People by Bloomberg, one of the top 20 Best-Performing CEOs by Harvard Business Review, Businessperson of the Year by Fortune readers, one of the Best CEOs in the World by Barron’s, Innovator of the Decade by Forbes Magazine and received The Economist’s Innovation Award. Benioff is also a member of the World Economic Forum Board of Trustees.
Benioff created the 1-1-1 model of philanthropy, which leverages the resources of Salesforce to improve communities around the world: donating 1% of Salesforce’s product, 1% of its equity and 1% of employees' time to help nonprofits achieve their missions. Today, more than 1,400 companies have adopted the 1-1-1 model through the Pledge 1% movement. Benioff and his wife, Lynne, have focused their personal philanthropy on children’s health, including building UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals in San Francisco and Oakland, as well as on public education, homelessness and other social issues.
Benioff believes that businesses are the greatest platforms for change in the world. He has embraced World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab’s multi-stakeholder approach to leadership, serving not only shareholders but all stakeholders--including customers, employees, partners, communities and the environment--to make the world a better place. Benioff is also inspiring fellow business leaders to do the same. He led a group of CEOs and business leaders in opposing state legislation that discriminated against LGBTQ communities, and instituted a company-wide salary assessment at Salesforce to ensure men and women were being paid equally for comparable work.
Benioff is a 35-year veteran of the software industry. Prior to launching Salesforce, he spent 13 years at Oracle Corporation. He founded his first company, Liberty Software, which created video games, at the age of 15. He also worked as an assembly language programmer in Apple Computer’s Macintosh Division. Benioff received a B.S. in Business Administration in 1986 and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2014 from the University of Southern California.
He is the author of three books, including the national best seller, Behind the Cloud.

Parker Harris
Co-Founder

Parker Harris oversees product strategy for Salesforce, from design to development to service delivery.
Parker founded Salesforce along with Marc Benioff, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez in the spring of 1999. Prior to founding Salesforce, Parker developed cloud computing expertise at Left Coast Software, a company he co-founded in 1996, and sales force automation expertise at Metropolis Software, an early pioneer in field sales force automation subsequently acquired by Clarify.
Parker developed a love of math, science and computer programming at an early age, but also developed the other side of his brain with a fluency in French and a degree in English Literature from Middlebury College.

Keith Block
Vice Chairman, President and COO

Keith Block is the Vice Chairman, President and COO of Salesforce and serves on its board of directors. He leads the company’s day-to-day operations, including its rapidly growing, multi-billion dollar global sales and services business, alliances and channels, industry strategy, corporate development, corporate affairs, marketing and business operations.
Block has managed world-class sales, consulting and engineering teams for nearly 30 years, with a focus on customer transformation. Prior to joining Salesforce in 2013, Block served as Oracle’s executive vice president of North America Sales and Consulting, leading a multi-billion dollar sales and services business unit that achieved record revenue and margin during his tenure. He began his career at Booz Allen Hamilton as a senior consultant.
Block currently serves on the World Economic Forum’s Information Technology Community  as a Governor, the Board of Trustees for Carnegie-Mellon University, the Advisory Board at Carnegie-Mellon University Heinz Graduate School and the Board of Trustees at the Concord Museum. He is also actively involved with the Boston Partners in Education, a nonprofit focused on enhancing the academic achievement and personal growth of Boston’s public school students.
Block holds a Master’s of Science degree in Management and Policy Analysis and a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Information Systems from Carnegie-Mellon University.

Alex Dayon
President, Chief Product Officer

Alex Dayon is president of Salesforce’s products. Dayon, who holds several patents, is focused around creating business value out of technology disruption.
Dayon joined Salesforce in 2008 through the acquisition of InStranet, a leading knowledge-base company where he was a founder and served as its CEO. Prior to InStranet, Dayon was a founding member of Business Objects SA where he led the product group for more than 10 years.
Dayon holds a master’s degree in electrical engineering from Ecole Supérieure d'Electricité (SUPELEC) in France.

Today, Salesforce serves as a successful model for corporate social responsibility, with hundreds of companies adopting this model through Pledge 1%.
Suzanne is a recognized leader in corporate philanthropy. She has been named one of Inside Philanthropy’s 50 Most Powerful Women in Philanthropy and is member of the San Francisco Business Times’ Most Influential Women in Bay Area Business hall of fame.
