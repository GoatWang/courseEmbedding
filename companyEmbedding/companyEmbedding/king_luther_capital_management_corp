Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Lawson Products (NASDAQ:LAWS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $25.00 (10.38% upside)

Our investment philosophy was founded with the firm in 1979, and we still believe in it today. We focus on investing in high-quality businesses that we believe will produce consistent, repeatable and, ultimately, superior risk-adjusted returns for our clients.
Our investment philosophy is grounded in our fundamental analysis of companies that meet our stringent investment criteria, such as market dominance, high or rising returns on invested capital, strong cash flow characteristics and sound balance sheets. Coupled with long-standing valuation disciplines as a means of seeking to manage overall investment risk, we believe these and other factors have enabled us to achieve successful long-term results for our clients.  Our experienced, proprietary research team plays an integral role in identifying these high-quality companies.
