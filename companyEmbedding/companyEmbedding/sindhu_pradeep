Sindhu, Pradeep
Business Leader Profiles for Students 
COPYRIGHT 2002 The Gale Group, Inc.




Sindhu, Pradeep(1953-)
Juniper Networks, Inc.OverviewPradeep Sindhu, through the company he founded, Juniper Networks, Inc., helped revolutionize broadband access, speed, and reliability to Internet service providers with the high–speed router hardware that he developed and marketed. In only five years Juniper became a leader in network technology, boasting an impressive 30–percent share of the multi–billion router core market and standing as the only serious competition for networking leader Cisco Systems. Sindhu's simultaneous involvement in the control of his company and the development of the M40 router was a both a business and technological feat. The M160 router, which was the same size but four times as powerful than the prototype M40, was an unprecedented technological achievement that helped Juniper become one of the forerunners in its field.Personal LifePradeep Sindhu is both a husband and a father. He has received a number of awards, including the Technologist of the Year award from SiliconIndia in 2000. His company also received numerous awards, including the Data communications Testers Choice Award, the Nikkei Industry Awards for Superiority, and PC Magazine's Best Internet Product Award.Sindhu was born in 1953 in India. In 1974 he graduated with a bachelor's degree in technology from the Indian Institute of Technology in India, and received a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Hawaii. In 1983 he earned a Ph.D. in computer



science from Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. Sindhu then took a job as a principal scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, where he developed design tools for high–speed interconnects for shared–memory multiprocessors. He later worked at Sun Microsystems and was involved in the design and development of Sun's first high–performance multiprocessor systems family, incorporating the SS1000 and SS2000.Career DetailsIn 1995, while was working at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), Pradeep Sindhu formulated the idea to create a new company. He saw a growing need for high–end Internet routers that was not being met by manufacturers. "I felt networking was an area with maximum growth potential," he told Indiatimes. "We decided to focus on the Internet router market because the number of Internet users was doubling rapidly and the cost of bandwidth was coming down, but the routers that were existing back then were very limited in their capability."Sindhu established Juniper Networks in 1996. Operating the firm from his home, he immediately began securing financial support and recruiting experienced professionals. Renowned venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, former founding CEO of Sun Microsystems, invested $200,000 for the formation of the Silicon Valley–based Juniper. In a shrewd move, Sindhu, being a technology specialist with no business background, soon hired Scott Kriens as the company's president and CEO. He lured the most talented engineers away from his former employers as well as such rivals as Sun Microsystems, Xerox PARC, and Cisco in order to create a workforce capable of providing the speed to market required of the complex, high–tech products. An increase in the number of Internet users resulted in more data traffic over the lines, and Juniper sought to fill the need for faster and more efficient routers. The new routers that Juniper developed were the most powerful on the market, able to transmit high volumes of data for Internet and telecommunications companies.In 1999 Juniper Networks went public. Its opening price was $34 per share, and by the end of the year it had jumped tenfold to $304 per share, raising $76 billion for the relatively new company.One of the keys to the company's success was the advanced technology of its products. Unlike its competitors' decade–old recycled technology, JUNOS router software was specifically designed for Internet use. At the heart of each of its M–series router was the Internet Processor II ASIC. Sindhu described its function on Juniper's website: "The Internet Processor II ASIC's ability to process packets intelligently with uncompromising performance is unique to Juniper Networks routers and is the key to enabling smart IP services. Juniper Networks M–series routers, powered by the Internet Processor II ASIC and controlled by JUNOS software, enable a truly integrated multiservice IP network for the first time in the industry."The fact that the company specialized in one area, Internet routers, and did it better than any other company was another reason that Juniper became a leader in its field. The third key to Juniper's success rested in the speed at which it could develop and deliver technology. Despite its small size, Juniper was able to execute the difficult task involved in new router technology with greater speed and efficiency. The final explanation for Juniper's meteoric rise to success was that it outsourced all of its manufacturing, enabling it to focus 100 percent on development. Sindhu's role as chief technology officer allowed the entrepreneur to focus wholly on plotting the future of technology at the company, as well as participating in actual design and development of products. Proof of that success: in 1999 the company generated $103 million in revenue. One year later this figure jumped more than 550 percent, to $674 million.Chronology: Pradeep Sindhu

1953:   Born.1974:   Received bachelor's degree from IIT Kanpur.1983:   Received Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University.1996:   Formed Juniper Networks, Inc.1999:   Juniper went public.1999:   Juniper generated $103 million in revenue.2000:   Revenue jumped 550 percent to $674 million.2000:   Juniper's M160 router was the fastest on the market.2000:   Juniper acquired Micro Magic.

2000:   Partnered with Blue Star to distribute routers in India.In March 2000 after 18 months of development, Juniper's M160 router was unveiled as the fastest on the market. The new product gave Juniper a distinct advantage over its competition. "The significant thing about this development is that this machine is four times more



powerful than the M40 and is the same size as the M40," Sindhu told The Economic Times Online. "This is the first time in the history of communications or computing that this has been achieved." As companies lined up to order the M160, such rivals as Cisco, Nortel, and Lucent rushed to build a similar router, though none appeared on the market until early 2001, nearly a year later.Juniper continued to grow and expand, raising $1 billion in early 2001 for acquisitions, research and development, and marketing. It partnered with LM Ericsson to produce mobile Internet devices and joined with Blue Star Limited to distribute routers in India. Juniper acquired Micro Magic, a leading integrated circuit solutions company, in December 2000.While many technology companies, including Cisco, warned of a slowdown in the industry in 2001, Juniper raised its yearly forecast by 14 percent to $1.6 billion. However, as of November 2001, Juniper's stock was valued at $21.92 per share, down from the previous year's lofty $185.88. Although it appeared that Juniper had joined the other victims of the technology downturn, its possibilities for future growth remained bright. According to leading researchers, the $2 billion market for high–end routers will soar to $12 billion by 2003. Sindhu believes his company will grow along with it.Sindhu himself expanded into the field of venture capitalism, investing his company's profits into start–ups not unlike Juniper Networks. His native India had emerged as one of the fastest–growing information technology markets, having blossomed from $100 million to nearly $100 billion in 10 years. Sindhu intended to capitalize on India's healthy market, also benefiting from the fact that the venture capital business was still in its infancy there. Vishuni Varshney, chairman of the Indian Venture Capital Association, said that of the $1 billion in venture capital invested in new Indian technology start–ups in 2000, most came from U.S. investors.Social and Economic ImpactOnly five years after its formation, Juniper Networks became a leader in its field, Internet routers. This business accomplishment was remarkable, yet Pradeep Sindhu's scientific contributions have been equally impressive. His own groundbreaking work, along with that of the specialists that he gathered at Juniper, pushed the outer limits of technology and set the bar for others in the industry by designing the fastest, most advanced products in the least amount of time. "By far the biggest unsung hero is Pradeep Sindhu," said venture capitalist Khosla in Inter@ctive Week. "He permanently changed the definition of what a router does and how it is built, and got Internet Protocol on a robust footing."Sindhu steered his upstart Juniper Networks into uncharted territory, vying with industry giant Cisco Systems, which had a near monopoly in the sector. With his vision of producing faster, more powerful routers and delivering them more quickly to the market, Sindhu was able to grab a healthy share of market and change the face of technology in the process. Building on the success of Juniper, Sindhu quickly dove into the profitable world of venture capitalism, funding start–ups like his own in Silicon Valley and worldwide.Sources of InformationContact at: Juniper Networks, Inc.

Where to start

Making the decision going to college, pursuing an advanced degree or obtaining an industry recognized certificate is one of the most important decisions an individual will make in their lifetime. When considering an educational institution there are numerous factors that need to be taken into account before an education decision can be made. 
Here are the main factors to consider when looking at pursuing an advanced degree or completing a certificate program:
Online VS In Person: This is the first fundamental question that prospective students need to ask themselves. If you are the kind of person that is self driven, has a tight schedule or is not in a commutable distance to an in person institution, then pursuing an online degree could be a good fit. However, if you find yourself needing to be in a physical classroom environment and learn better that way, then you should seek out in person programs that can better suite your needs. People learn in all different kinds of ways. Some are visual learners, some experiential and some need to hear things to have the information really sink in. No one knows himself or herself better than you, so listen to your gut and first determine what kind of learner you are before embarking on the next steps. Rasmssen College goes into greater depth about the plusses and minuses of online v.s. traditional educational settings. 
Career Opportunities: When exploring areas of study that you are interested in, one recommendation is to first explore the types of jobs and careers in that industry. Often times people find that after obtaining a degree that has set them back a significant amount of money, that the career field that they have their degree in is either not growing or is underpaid in relation to the cost of the degree. We suggest exploring a variety of careers and use the information contained here in conjunction with The Bureau of Labor and Statistics Data to determine if you are making a wise investment in your degree. All of the statistics we have assembled on career and degree data come from the BLS website and are intended to help students make wise decisions about their studies and career options with a degree or certificate. 



 
Time Commitment: The amount of time that you have available to apply to your studies is going to be one of the most important factors in your decision. If you are working a full time job, you will have to figure out a way of balancing your personal life, with your schoolwork. This article from US News and World Report will help you come up with a game plan for managing your time
Financial Aid, Scholarships and Student Loans: Once you have decided that you want to go to college and have a career path planned out once you obtain your degree, then it’s time to figure out how to pay for the degree. Most institutions have different financing options that you will have to do your homework on, but all usually have some form of financial aid or scholarships available. When looking for information on student aid and the resources available to students, we recommend starting at the Federal Student Aid website. This is an office of the U.S. Department of Education and here, students will find a wealth of resources and information that will help them better determine what kind of aid or grants are available to them.

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

Juniper Networks is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California that develops and markets networking products. Its products include routers, switches, network management software, network security products and software-defined networking technology.
The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco's once-dominant market-share.[3][4] It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.
Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

History[edit]
Origins and funding[edit]




Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu


Pradeep Sindhu,[5] a scientist with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC),[6] conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995[7] and founded the company in February 1996.[8] At the time most routers used for Internet traffic were intended for phone calls and had dedicated circuits for each caller. Sindhu wanted to create packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic.[7][9] He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.[10]
Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company's first year of operations.[11] About seven months after the company's founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer.[6][12] By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding.[13] Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments[14] from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com.[15][16][17][18] Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&T.[19]
Growth and IPO[edit]
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998.[20] By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies.[7] Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan[7] and offices were established in Korea in 1999.[21] Juniper Networks's market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later,[6] and 20% by April 2000.[22]
Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999[23] and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June.[24] The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191%[25] to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion.[26] According to Telephony, Juniper Networks became the "latest darling of Wall Street",[27][28] reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July.[29] Within a year, the company's stock grew five-fold.[6]
Juniper Networks's revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million.[30] That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.[7]
Competition[edit]
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales.[20][28] According to BusinessWeek, "analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper's boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco's because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds."[30] However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position.[6][30] The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a "David versus Goliath" story.[7][9] Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the "anti-Cisco" for being a small company with a narrow focus.[5][30][31]
In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that BusinessWeek said was intended to challenge Juniper's increasing market-share.[30] According to BusinessWeek, Juniper's top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products.[32] Cisco's routers were not expected to erode Juniper's growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper's routers.[30]
Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper's edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release.[20] Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from Light Reading proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion.[20] By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what Network World called a "'speeds-and-feeds' public relations contest".[4]
By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market.[33] By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively.[34] Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.[35][36]
Further development[edit]
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices,[37][38] and with Nortel for fiber optic technology.[39] In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China.[7][40]:12 Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown[41] and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust.[42] 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.[43]
Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year[42][44] and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005.[45] Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment.[46] Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change.[47][48] By 2005 enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company's revenues,[46] but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&D for the enterprise market.[49]
In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices.[50][51] Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly.[50][52] In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003.[50] This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.[52]
2008–present[edit]
In July 2008 Juniper's first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO.[53][54] Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia.[55] Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company's software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system.[56] Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts.[57] The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.[58]
In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed.[59][60] The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found.[61] In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO.[62] He started the position in January 2014.[63][64]
In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs,[65] before Kheradpir was officially appointed.[66] That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board.[67][68] That April, 6% of the company's staff were laid off to cut expenses.[69] In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper's board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer.[70] An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.[71]
In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper's patents for application firewalls.[72]
Acquisitions and investments[edit]
Main article: List of acquisitions by Juniper Networks
By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership's preference for organic growth.[31] The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks.[73] In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies.[74] Juniper revised NetScreen's channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.[75]
Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks.[76] Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.[77][78] Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.[79]
From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, than selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients.[55] Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks.[55][80] In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter.[81] and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems.[82] In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.[83]
Products[edit]
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products.[84] It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.[84]
Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs.[85][86] According to analyst firm Dell'Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers[87] and second for core routers with 25% of the core market.[88] It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market.[89][90] In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco.[91] In WLAN, where Juniper holds a joint development and marketing agreement with Aruba Networks, it holds a more marginal market share.[92] Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.[93]

Routers and switches[edit]
Juniper Networks' first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998.[94][95] The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40.[40]:8[96] It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM.[97][98] It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products.[96][99] The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999[7] and the M160 in March 2000.[100][101]
By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system.[102] That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers.[103] In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.[104][105] The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.[106]
By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic.[40]:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000.[31][107][108] By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core.[109] Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market.[110] In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband.[73] The product family was discontinued later that year.[111]
Juniper's first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, Network World said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were "newer and less robust" than other aspects of the product.[112] Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010.[113] In 2012 it released the ACX family of universal access routers.[114][115] In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released.[116][117] Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.[118]
In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol[119] methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year.[120] In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.[121]
In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers.[118] In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.[122][123]
Security[edit]




Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance


Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT).[124][125] Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line,[126] as well as remote desktop access software.[127] The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition[128] and its first wireless product.[129] The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004.[130][131] An open interface for the development of third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.[132]
In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market.[128][133] Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches.[134] According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was "the first serious threat" to competing products from Cisco.[135] Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.[136]
In August 2011, Juniper and AT&T announced they would jointly develop the AT&T Mobile Security application based on Juniper's Pulse security software.[137] In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos' software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity.[138] In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines.[139] The following month Juniper Networks released several products for "intrusion deception", which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.[140]




Marked in yellow: backdoor admin password hidden in the code


An analysis of Juniper's ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual_EC_DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20[141] and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password.[142] Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS.[143] Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that "If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it’s an amazing coincidence."[144]
In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered "unauthorized code" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.[145]
Software defined networking[edit]
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN).[116] It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system.[146] In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.[147]
In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems.[148] A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.[118]
Recent updates[edit]
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio.[149][150][151]
According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova in June 2015, Juniper Networks is the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.[152]
Operations[edit]
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% are from EMEA and 20% are from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC.[79] About 50% of Juniper's revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.[153]
According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year.[154] It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.[155]
According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has "a strong focus" on research and development. R&D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013.[116] Most of the company's manufacturing is outsourced[9] to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology.[79] Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system.[55][156] As of 2011 Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.[55]

A Message from Juniper Networks’ Founder, Pradeep Sindhu




by


Pradeep Sindhu

		

	
		on 
‎02-06-2017
01:30 PM





















As many of you know, I have always had a passion for solving large, complex problems that have broad industry applicability. One of the biggest challenges facing the high tech industry today is how to make radical improvements to the economics, security, and reliability of cloud data centers given the slowdown of Moore's Law and the progressive increase in the ratio of communication to computation for contemporary applications. This is the reason I founded Fungible in 2015.
 
I am equally passionate about the success of Juniper Networks, the company I founded in 1996. I believe that the technology I am working on at Fungible, in conjunction with Juniper's technologies, have the potential to revolutionize the industry. This is why Juniper has invested in Fungible.
 
I am confident in Rami Rahim’s continued leadership and I will transition to the role of Chief Scientist at Juniper Networks so that I can devote more time to my duties as Chief Executive Officer of Fungible. I will play an active role in the search for Juniper’s next Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and will continue to serve as CTO until Juniper finds a suitable replacement. I am very much looking forward to working with the new CTO at Juniper in my new role as Chief Scientist. In connection with our upcoming annual meeting in May, I plan to transition from Vice Chairman of Juniper's Board of Directors to Technical Advisor to the Board. I remain fully committed to Juniper's continued success.
 
Pradeep Sindhu
Founder, Chief Technology Officer, and Vice Chairman to the Board, Juniper Networks

I invented reconfigurable computing and I'm trying to raise money. You seem to have a kitchen sink, pragmatic, approach to the data center of the future. I have a clear vision and would be happy to discuss it with you.
 
Cheers

Contrary to popular belief, automation does require some level of human interaction. For example, when you step into a self-driving car, it does not automatically know where to go or when to start driving—you have to start the car and tell it your desired destination in order to achieve your goal. Automation, therefore, can only complete a task that has been initiated by a human.

Cloud-Grade Networking: For the Win




by


Khutchins

		

	
		on 
‎06-21-2017
07:00 AM




















We live in exciting and disruptive times where everything is shifting to the cloud. Carrier-grade networking has been the foundation of the internet that we have come to know and love. There continues to be an insatiable need for network capacity, with global Ethernet traffic volume estimated to reach 17,000 Tbps by 2020[1]. Service providers will continue to be under pressure to deliver rapid, low-latency and high-volume communication of information. This has been especially important to enterprises which are increasingly adopting cloud-managed enterprise connectivity to reduce costs while increasing control and flexibility.
 
Virtually every company in the connected world has either decided on, or is actively formulating, their cloud strategy. In this process, the network is taking on a new level of importance. As the underlying infrastructure evolves to support cloud, we at Juniper Networks believe a new standard of networking is here: cloud-grade networking.

When Acquisitions Lead to Uncertainty

Mike Marcellin

08:00 AM




















In the high-tech vendor world, oftentimes acquisitions can be exciting for customers. When related technologies come together, it can create unique opportunities to blend products, simplify procurement, and collapse support and services contracts under a single supplier. But when assets are sold under duress, the outcomes can be more uncertain.

Skills Transformation Through Juniper’s OpenLab Throwdown




by


jerry p

		

	
		on 
‎03-30-2017
08:00 AM




















Imagine a world where predictive, automated and network-based mega-services adapt to user behavior, enabling better decision-making and enriching personal and business lives. In this world of tomorrow, network engineers will spend more time developing next-generation software than they do physically configuring routers and switches. At Juniper Networks, we call this an era of Digital Cohesion and businesses are quickly approaching this new frontier.
 
To support this era, communications service providers will need to re-examine the way they architect their networks. As the technology landscape evolves, networking engineers are required to develop new skillsets to keep up with emerging responsibilities and a transforming industry. That’s where Juniper’s OpenLab comes into play. OpenLab’s programs offer the current and future IT workforce the tools and hands-on education they need to propel their expertise to stay ahead of the changing tech landscape.

A Message from Juniper Networks’ Founder, Pradeep Sindhu

Pradeep Sindhu

		

	
		on 
‎02-06-2017
01:30 PM




















As many of you know, I have always had a passion for solving large, complex problems that have broad industry applicability. One of the biggest challenges facing the high tech industry today is how to make radical improvements to the economics, security, and reliability of cloud data centers given the slowdown of Moore's Law and the progressive increase in the ratio of communication to computation for contemporary applications. This is the reason I founded Fungible in 2015.
 
I am equally passionate about the success of Juniper Networks, the company I founded in 1996.

How you do things matters just as much as what you build. If you look internally and see acceptance of the ordinary, apathy, or stagnation, it’s only a matter of time for it to reflect in your products and value. So, when we decided to proactively redefine how we build software at Juniper, it was a major initiative, but not uncharacteristic. After all, it makes us better on the inside.

As we have worked on large-scale deployments of hybrid clouds with SaaS providers and NFV with telecom service providers, we realize at Juniper Networks that some of the biggest obstacles to adoption and growth of these environments are operations and workload management.
 
As hybrid cloud and NFV solutions mature, the day-one experience has become fairly smooth. While there are many software components that must come together to create an orchestration stack, the market is standardizing, and we are tackling the deployment problem through automation and systems integrations efforts with our partners like Red Hat, Canonical, and Mirantis.

At Juniper Networks, our products are at the heart of some of the world’s largest Telco and SaaS Providers’ networks. But increasingly, our customers are not only demanding solutions for software-defined networking, but they’re now asking Juniper to help solve operational challenges and workload management in both Telco Cloud and Enterprise Hybrid Cloud environments. We continue to aim towards solving these problems and ultimately these may lead our solutions – especially OpenContrail – in some exciting new directions.

At last week’s annual Juniper Networks’ customer conference, NXTWORK, our CEO Rami Rahim struck a chord with the audience and media when he laid out a vision for the not-so-distant future: a world of Digital Cohesion. This new era can be described as a world in which applications connect and self-assemble in a way that will enhance our lives.
 
We hear a lot about digital disruption and digital transformation. But what sets Digital Cohesion apart is that it goes beyond point services to holistic mega-services and that these services are anticipatory and adaptive based on the amazing work happening around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Work[edit]
Sindhu had worked at the Computer Science Lab of Xerox PARC for 11 years.[1] Sindhu worked on design tools for very-large-scale integration (VLSI) of integrated circuits and high-speed interconnects for shared memory architecture multiprocessors.
Sindhu founded Juniper Networks along with Dennis Ferguson and Bjorn Liencres in February 1996 in California.[1] The company was subsequently reincorporated in Delaware in March 1998 and went public on June 25, 1999.
Sindhu work on the architecture, design, and development of the Juniper M40 data router.[2]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
