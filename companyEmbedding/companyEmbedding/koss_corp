History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


John C. Koss founded the J.C. Koss Hospital Television Rental Company in 1953. After a short time Koss was looking for new ideas, and partnered with Martin Lange to eventually develop a stereo headphone. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, in 1991 Koss Audio & Video Electronics started producing and selling consumer electronics products as a separate company in Hazelwood, Missouri, United States. The Koss family owns more than 75% of the firm.
Having only a high-school education, John C. Koss worked with Lange, an engineer, to develop the headphone that launched the company almost by accident, as they came upon the headphone idea as a result of an attempt to market a portable phonograph.[2] What made this product unique was the privacy switch feature, which gave listeners the opportunity to listen to the first Koss SP/3 Stereophones. Initially, the products purpose was to demonstrate to consumers the high-fidelity stereo sound of the portable phonograph.[3]
Prior to this time, headphones had only been used for communications purposes. In 1958, the design was debuted at a hi-fi trade show in Milwaukee, and audiences were approving of the design. Soon after the trade show, Koss went into business manufacturing and marketing stereophones from his basement apartment. The technology was imitated by competing manufacturers, which set the design and aesthetics of headphones for years to come.[3]
Working out of two nearby locations in the early 1970s - one housing Koss TV-Rental, which also did electronics and musical instrument repairs - and their main facility two blocks to the east - Koss pioneered the high-end "electro-static" "ES series" headphone market. These headphones set the standard for wide-range frequency response. Being very durable, they required service for wear and tear on cords and ear pads - and K&M Electronics (Klenworth & Midwest based in Minneapolis), working out of the TV Rental location, supported the repair efforts, mainly of headphones that came in by the case from those customer locations. Koss headphones were easy and cost-effective to repair. At this site, in a separate garage setup, the musical instrument and electronics repair was done. The TV-rental and repair site was managed by John's brother Pete Koss. Eventually Koss dominated the headphone market, competing mainly with Telex. Koss however was considered a higher quality unit at the time, offering a wide line of models. Growth in the late 1970s caused them to move to their present location on the north side of Milwaukee.
Diversification into related electronics areas in the 1980s ended in disaster for Koss, who filed for bankruptcy protection after a net loss in 1984 of $6 million. Koss emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1985.[2]
In 1991 Michael J. Koss, son of founder John C. Koss, took over as president and chief executive officer.
In December 2009, former vice president of finance Sujata "Sue" Sachdeva was charged in federal court with wire fraud after the firm discovered her embezzlement of $34 million. Sachdeva was sentenced to 11 years in federal prison.[4] Koss was forced to restate five years of financials.[citation needed]

Their ability to be adapted to take the high-end Etymotic ear tip (known as the Koss Hybrid), and the popular Koss Porta Pro has contributed to their success. Their budget-priced headphones (the KSC series in particular) are widely regarded as some of the best low-end headphones on the market.[5] Since 1989, all headphones manufactured in North America by KOSS come with a limited lifetime warranty, which covers normal use by the initial user or purchaser.[6]

Koss History
Koss Corporation founder John Koss shares his behind-the-scenes story of inventing the  world's first SP/3 Stereophone in 1958, and the emotional thrill of being "enclosed in the music" thanks to his innovation.

Founded 1958
World's First SP/3 Stereophone
In 1958, John C. Koss teamed up with engineer Martin Lange, Jr. to develop a portable stereo phonograph player with side-wing speakers. The pair demonstrated their new stereo record player at a Wisconsin audio show. One of the product's unique features was a privacy switch, which allowed listeners to hear music by plugging in the world's first SP/3 Stereophone. The stereophones were intended to be an accessory to demonstrate the high-fidelity stereo sound that the portable phonograph player delivered.
The revolutionary sound of the Koss SP/3 Stereophone became the hit of the show.









1958
SP/3
The World's First Koss Stereophone
In 1958, John C. Koss invented personal listening with the world’s first SP/3 Stereophone. Koss sought to replicate the excitement of a live musical performance. The original SP/3 Stereophone allowed listeners to experience sound as they had never before, bringing them closer to the music they love.

1968
ESP/6
In 1968, Koss released the ESP/6, the world’s first self-energizing electrostatic headphone. To achieve its unprecedented sound profile, the ESP/6 employed the principle of a currentless, or electrostatic charge. The charge was applied to push-pull condenser plates, and caused movement of an ultra lightweight conductive diaphragm.




 
1969
Air Force One Outfitted With Koss Stereophones.
In 1969, passengers aboard Air Force One were treated to the Sound of Koss. The Presidential Plane’s state-of-the-art entertainment system featured Koss headphones at every seat - including the staff, press, and presidential quarters. About 50 Pro/4 units in total lined the aircraft.

Pro/4AAA
In 1976, Koss introduced the Pro/4AAA. Building off the Pro/4AA’s iconic sound, the Pro/4AAA incorporated a number of new design features. The most notable of these features were the headphone’s Direct Contour Pneumalite ear cushions. The shape of the cushions mirrored an ear’s natural “D” shape. This advancement in design informed the very pronounced “D” Profile found in many Koss headphones today.

Each diaphragm moves uniformly thanks to an electron deposited proprietary semi-conductive coating.

Introduction into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame
In 1958, John C. Koss team up with engineer Martin Lange, Jr. to develop a portable stereo phonograph player with side-wing speakers. The pair demonstrated their new stereo record player at a Wisconsin audio show. One of the product's unique features was a privacy switch, which allowed listeners to hear music by plugging in the world's first Koss SP/3 Stereophone. The stereo-phones were intended to be an accessory to demonstrate the high-fidelity stereo sound that the portable phonograph player delivered.
John C. Koss Sr. is inducted into the inaugural class of the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame. At the dawn of the transistor era, John Koss St. designed a set of commercial headphones using World War II military headphones. It was 1958 and the stereo business was taking off with the advent of rock'n'roll music. The headphones were called "private listening units".
This award is in recognition of John Koss Sr. contribution and pioneering spirit that have laid the foundation of consumer electronics.

The warranty does not cover: damage resulting from abnormal or commercial use; modifications by you of the Product; cosmetic damage; any defect resulting from abuse, misuse, accident, failure to follow Product instructions; problems caused by you; problems caused by maintenance or repair of the Product by anyone other than Koss or a Koss designated party; or damage caused by liquid. (The Product may contain a liquid sensor that indicates the presence of excessive liquid.) Koss is not liable for any damage to or loss of any user data. Normal decrease in battery capacity over time is not covered by this warranty.
Unless otherwise required by law, this warranty does not cover any open so urce software (software provided under public license by third parties).
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE PRODUCT. Opening the Product or attempting to open the Product may cause damage that this warranty does not cover. This warranty is void if the Product is returned with any alterations, including removal of the external cover.
What do you have to do to place a warranty claim? You are required to submit the Product to Koss for inspection to confirm the alleged defect. Koss will not provide coverage under this warranty unless you comply with all terms. To request warranty service, you must: (1) return the Product in prepaid, secure and protective packaging to Koss Corp., 4129 N. Port Washington Ave., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A. 53212; and (2) enclose a short but specific description of the alleged defect with a copy of your original receipt and sufficient information to allow Koss to contact you.
What will Koss do? During the Warranty Period Koss will perform any repair or replacement that is covered by this warranty without charge to you. If Koss does not confirm the alleged defect, Koss will inform you of the estimated fee for repair efforts. There is no charge for this estimate. After the Warranty Period, service for the Product, including battery replacement, may be available from Koss for a fee.
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY BREACH OF THE WARRANTY SHALL BE THE OBLIGATION OF KOSS, AT ITS SOLE OPTION (subject to applicable law), TO EITHER (1) REPAIR OR REPLACE THE PRODUCT; OR (2) PAY TO YOU DAMAGES YOU ACTUALLY INCURRED IN REASONABLE RELIANCE, BUT ONLY UP TO THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE THAT YOU PAID LESS REASONABLE DEPRECIATION BASED ON ACTUAL USE where permitted by law. Koss reserves the right to repair or replace the Product or parts (including discontinued items) with a product or parts which may be new, refurbished, reconditioned or returned, including items manufactured by Koss or others, but which are comparable in function and performance to the original product or part. Unless otherwise required by law, repair and replacement services and repaired, replaced, reconditioned or refurbished parts and/or products are not warranted and any (if any) implied warranties, conditions or duties regarding such services are hereby disclaimed.
EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES and LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Except as provided in the above “Exclusive Remedy” section, Koss shall not be liable to you or anyone else for any loss, injury or damages relating to the warranted product, this warranty, any implied warranty or condition, or to any remedy elected by Koss, including (without limitation) attempts to repair or replace the product. Also, Koss shall not be liable for any general, special, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive, or other damages of any kind or nature whatsoever (except for the damages described in the “EXCLUSIVE REMEDY” section above). The Exclusive Remedy elected by Koss shall constitute Koss’ only liability to you or anyone else whether such liability is based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise. The foregoing limitations and exclusions shall apply even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.
No Koss agent or employee is authorized to modify this warranty. If any term of this warranty is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining terms shall remain enforceable. The laws of the State of Wisconsin, USA, govern this warranty.
NOTE: Avoid playing the Product at high volume levels. Some studies have concluded that prolonged and extensive exposure to noise in excess of 95dB may impair hearing. Never use the Product while operating a motorized vehicle. It may create a traffic hazard and is illegal in many areas. Exercise caution if you are wearing the Product while engaged in activities such as walking, race-walking, jogging, cycling, etc. which may bring you in contact with vehicular traffic.

				   Great Sound, Build Quality, and Outstanding Comfort				








Overall










					I have had these headphones for 6 months now and have barley showed any sign of wear, which is impressive considering they are used on a daily basis for hours on end. These headphones reproduce sound amazing well in comparison to Audio-Technica's ATH-M50 and Grados SR60e (Not saying both of these are bad!). The build quality feels and performs great from the metal construction and leather ear pads. Their comfort is plainly amazing from their light weight, comfortable ear pads, and shape. And unexpectedly, their sound canceling is greater than I imagined and felt the dual 2.5 MM jacks were a pleasant convenience. In my mind, these are the perfect headphones that are firmly worthy of the cost.

				   Being in the band				








Overall










					The balance, detail, vocal or instrumental background separation and clarity are delivered in excellent isolation.  The sense of being in the "band"  is prominent and for me a step up from "listening" or attending to sound exclusively.					

						Review by Flint						/
					   (Posted on 4/16/2017)					


				   High expectations more than met!				








Overall










					Have been a Koss fan since my first set of Pro4AA's in the late 70's. Those were followed up by Pro4X's and then PortaPro's, UR40's and BT540i's. Each better than the last. Then, I purchased a set of these for my oldest son as a Christmas gift (to be his 3rd set of Koss stereophones) and asked for a listen....Blown away!! Those who don't realize that these are tuned for studio / production work may not expect the flat response (across the full spectrum) these deliver (possibly expecting the overdriven bass of some competing brands). The balance is what brings every detail out with stunning clarity and has me hearing things I have never noticed in music I have listened to hundreds of times! Couple this with light weight, Koss quality (and warranty), and good looks and the Pro4S is impossible to beat even at far greater cost!

				   Outstanding!				








Overall










					This is the third pair of Koss phones I have owned. Without a doubt, the best sounding phones I have owned to date. Also, the most comfortable phones. Highly recommended.

				   Great phones for the studio				








Overall










					I have used Koss Headphones for many years in my recording studio.. My Pro 4AA are my studio workhorse's.... I bought the PRO4S just to check my mixes with and could not believe how flat they were.... I do not care for the detachable cable, it falls out all the time.... If Koss comes out with the PRO4S element " SLX40 " in headphones with a attached cable I would be buying a few of them....

				   Holographic imaging				








Overall










					I believe in the Koss brand for many reasons: incredible sound, quality, history, and that lifetime warranty. I figured these cans would be something special but I am blown away by the rich full sound. I knew based on the frequency range that these can get low but it's the beautiful highs that delight the senses. You can't go wrong with these as they are also easily driven by all types of devices (my Nexus 7 required an amp to be heard properly but not with these).					

						Review by gBoogie						/
					   (Posted on 12/3/2016)					


				   Beautiful				








Overall










					These babies remind me quite a bit of my old Pro-4AAA (which I still use and cherish.) Best new Koss product in decades. I spend a lot of time in the broadcast and recording studio. I've used a lot of brands and models. These are now #1 with a bullet on my charts. If I spend $400 I can match these... but why bother! Great price and great value.

Pros: Fit, sound insulation, freq. response, rugged construction

Cons: none

				   Amazing sound but not amazing build quality				








Overall










					First of all, these headphones sound amazing. Much better than the Sennheiser HD650s. I do wish that the were a little tighter on my head though. But they are very light and comfortable. The bottom line is that they sound amazing.					

						Review by Shane						/

				   The Headphone equivalent of the 'Monolith' from 2001: A Space Odyssey				








Overall










					These Electrostatic headphones are an incredible value, objectively providing broadband linearity and a uniform amplitude response across the key audible spectrum. Orthogonal transducers,especially of the electrostatic variety like this are generally many thousands of dollars as an entry price point in comparison.

The ESP950's transducers have an enormous planar area - one of the largest ever  in a pair of headphones to my  knowledge - they cover the sides of your head from hair to jawline! Despite this, they are very lightweight (the mylar diaphragm is so thin it is transparent!) and are truly an open headphone in a sense that traditional dynamic headphones simply cannot claim to be.

The resulting sound is not only highly accurate, the massive scale and transparent airiness combines to provide a truly breathtaking listening experience. While many headphones claim to reproduce the experience of listening at a concert, these do a better job than most speakers of that scale can claim. . . it's more like listening to your recordings as they sounded in the studio itself. 

Finally, the lifetime warranty on these is excellent peace of mind. I simply couldn't imagine investing this much into a pair of headphones without having Koss' legendary warranty to back it up.

				   Still great after 20 years of use!				








Overall










					I purchased these back in 1994,  other than ear pad replaments, they have been flawless.   These are still the best headphones I have ever owned.   They are very smooth from top to bottom.  Plenty of detail with the as well.  The bass is well extended, not boomy.  The mids are as clean as you can get.  They highs are crystalyn but not bright.   The only drawback I can think of is they can make the our ears sweat after a while.   The construction seems a bit flimsy, but they have held up nice for me.   Better than my ancient Stax electret I still have.

				   Electrostatics, A Pure Sound Source				








Overall










					As a professional recording engineer & audio purist, I've always wanted a pair of ESP950 headphones. Once I purchased a set, I was mesmerized by the sound quality. If you elect to hear crystal clear music without coloration or over-emphasized bass, then these are the headphones of choice. You'll notice subtleties you didn't know existed in your recordings. Other headphones mask what's really there. Dynamic headphones can't mach the sound quality of electrostatic headphones. The are well worth the investment.

Pros: Transparent Sound Quality

Cons: None					

						Review by Professional Studio						/
					   (Posted on 3/10/2015)					


				   A true bargain				








Overall










					I actually own 2 pair of these and have one hooked to my 2 channel audio only stereo and one to my a/v system. These headphones provide absolutely unmatched sound reproduction at a price that is very low for the technology involved. The depth of the soundstage is exactly as the recording engineers first intended. They have to be heard to be appreciated.

Pros: Unparalleled sound reproduction

Cons: Unparalleled sound reproduction					

						Review by Roger						/
					   (Posted on 12/23/2014)					


				   Outstanding Sound, with Comfort				








Overall










					I have owned these for 10 to 20 years and used the warranty at least once, at which time the drivers were renewed. I felt guilty spending so much on a set of headphones - until I heard them, after which I never regretted the purchase. My speakers include a pair of time-corrected (with digital crossovers) K-horns in a 5.1 system, a pair of Dayton-Wright electrostatics in another 5.1 system, and a pair of Ambience ribbon speakers in a 2.1 system. All excellent, but none better than these headphones.

Pros: Excellent sound, gorgeous midrange, true bass

Cons: Open design with little attenuation of ambient noise					

						Review by SAB						/
					   (Posted on 2/14/2014)					


				   Heavenly				








Overall










					These are some of the best high-end headphones out there. The sound of these phones is full and natural. No heavy bass or bright highs. You can listen all night long. They are very comfortable, and lightweight. Pricey, but there are deals out there. The 950 have a very open sound, which is a bit different from other headphones I have.

Pros: midrange to die for!

Cons: NONE					

						Review by dwest						/
					   (Posted on 1/23/2014)					


				   THE BEST THERE IS				








Overall










					I've had these for 20 years now and love them. If you are into private listening with fullness and detail you should have a set of these. I am looking to buy a 2nd pair for my other stereo. They really stand behind the product. I had a problem once and they replaced them no questions asked.

Pros: Everything

Cons: None					

						Review by Sasquauch						/
					   (Posted on 11/27/2012)					


				   Koss electrostatic head phones				








Overall










					Awesome head phones if you have the money to buy them. They sound great if you run a tube amp in to them. The high, mids, lows sound great! They have a free lifetime warranty.

Pros: great sound, every things

Cons: Big

				   great sounds but needs to be more sturdy				








Overall










					i love the sound quality i get with these headphones. they can be a little uncomfortable when you try wearing them while lying down but otherwise they fit well. the biggest issue is it breaks easily. the limited lifetime warranty saves me but considering it breaks so easily, $9 each time starts to add up

				   I love these headphones but they keep falling apart				








Overall










					I love Koss and their products especially porta pro's.  I wish they would make a pair of headphones with the Porta Pro sound and  noise cancellation. (hint)  The sp 330 ear piece keeps falling off and I do not know why.  I take care of them like a baby but for some reason the ear piece becomes loose, other than that I like and would recommend them!

	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	 




	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) (Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Additional written or oral forward-looking statements may be made by the Company from time to time in filings with the Securities Exchange Commission, press releases, or otherwise.  Statements contained in this Form 10-K that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Act.  Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, projections of revenue, income or loss and capital expenditures, statements regarding future operations, anticipated financing needs, compliance with financial covenants in loan agreements, plans for acquisitions or sales of assets or businesses, plans relating to products or services of the Company, assessments of materiality, predictions of future events, the effects of pending and possible litigation and assumptions relating to the foregoing.  In addition, when used in this Form 10-K, the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans” and variations thereof and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.




	 




	Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified based on current expectations.  Consequently, future events and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by, or underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, or in other Company filings, press releases, or otherwise.  In addition to the factors discussed in this Form 10-K, other factors that could contribute to or cause such differences include, but are not limited to, developments in any one or more of the following areas: future fluctuations in economic conditions, the receptivity of consumers to new consumer electronics technologies, the rate and consumer acceptance of new product introductions, competition, pricing, the number and nature of customers and their product orders, production by third party vendors, foreign manufacturing, sourcing, and sales (including foreign government regulation, trade and importation concerns), borrowing costs, changes in tax rates, pending or threatened litigation and investigations, and other risk factors which may be detailed from time to time in the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings.




	 




	Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date hereof.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unexpected events.

	PART I




	 








	ITEM 1.


	                                                    




	BUSINESS.




	 




	GENERAL




	 




	As used herein unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Company” means Koss Corporation and its former consolidated wholly-owned subsidiary, Koss Classics Ltd. (“Koss Classics”), which was dissolved in the three months ended September 30, 2011.  The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1971.




	 




	The Company operates in the audio/video industry segment of the home entertainment industry through its design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessory products.  The Company reports its results as a single reporting segment, as the Company’s principal business line is the design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories.




	 




	The Company’s products are sold through national retailers, international distributors, audio specialty stores, the internet, direct mail catalogs, regional department store chains, discount department stores, grocery stores, electronics retailers, military exchanges and prisons under the “Koss” name.  The Company also sells products to distributors for resale to school systems, and directly to other manufacturers for inclusion with their own products.  The Company has more than


	300


	 domestic dealers and its products are carried in approximately


	17,000


	 domestic retail outlets and numerous retailers worldwide.  International markets are served by domestic sales representatives and a sales office in Switzerland which utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries. 




	 




	Approximately 86% of the Company’s fiscal 2013 sales were for stereo headphones for listening to music.  The remaining 14% of the Company's sales were for headphones used in communications, education settings, and in conjunction with metal detectors. The products are not significantly differentiated by their retail sales channel or application with the exception of products sold to school systems and prisons.  There are no other product line differentiations other than the quality of the sound produced by the stereo headphone itself, which is highly subjective.









	In fiscal year 2012, the Company launched the Striva products which allow the consumer to listen to the stereo headphones directly from the World Wide Web using Wi-Fi. These products are sold through the Koss website.




	 




	The Company sources complete stereo headphones manufactured to its specifications from various manufacturers in Asia as well as raw materials used to produce stereo headphones at its plant in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Management believes that it has sources of complete stereo headphones and raw materials that are adequate for its needs.




	 




	There are no employment or compensation commitments between the Company and its dealers.  The Company has several independent manufacturers’ representatives as part of its distribution efforts.  The Company typically signs one year contracts with these manufacturers’ representatives.  The arrangements with foreign distributors do not contemplate that the Company pays any compensation other than any profit the distributors make upon their sale of the Company’s products.




	 




	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY




	 




	John C. Koss is recognized for creating the stereo headphone industry with the first SP3 stereo headphone in 1958.  The Company regularly applies for registration of its trademarks in many countries around the world, and over the years the Company has had numerous trademarks registered and patents issued in North America, South America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia.  The Company currently has approximately


	588


	 trademarks registered in


	99


	 countries around the world and


	173


	 patents in


	36


	 countries.  The Company has trademarks to protect the brand name, Koss, and its logo on its products.  The Company also holds many design patents that protect the unique visual appearance of some of its products.  These trademarks and patents are important to differentiate the Company from its competitors.  Certain of the Company’s trademarks are of material value and importance to the conduct of its business.  The Company considers protection of its proprietary developments important; however, the Company’s business is not, in the opinion of management, materially dependent upon any single trademark or patent.  During the year ended


	June 30, 2013


	, the Company took steps to update and monitor its patents and trademarks to protect its intellectual property around the world.




	 






	5















	SEASONALITY




	 




	Although retail sales of consumer electronics have typically been higher during the holiday season, stereo headphones have also seen increased purchases throughout the year.  Management believes that the Company's business and industry segment are no longer seasonal as evidenced by the fact that net sales for the year ended


	June 30, 2013


	 were almost equally split between the first and second halves of the year.  Management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers and distributors is related to the fact that stereo headphones have become replacement items for portable electronic products.  Therefore, upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereo headphones during the holiday season.




	 




	WORKING CAPITAL AND BACKLOG




	 




	The Company’s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet delivery requirements of its customers.  From time to time, although rarely, the Company may extend payment terms to its customers for a special promotion.  For instance, the Company has in the past offered a 90-120 day payment period for certain customers, such as computer retailers and office supply stores.  Based on historical trends, management does not expect these practices to have a material effect on net sales or net income.  The Company’s backlog of orders as of


	June 30, 2013


	 is not significant in relation to net sales during fiscal year


	2013


	 or projected fiscal year


	2014


	 net sales.




	 




	CUSTOMERS




	 




	The Company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music, DVD’s in vehicles, sound bytes on computer systems, and other audio related media.  The Company distributes these products through retail channels in the U.S. and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world.  The Company markets its products to approximately


	17,000


	 domestic retailers and numerous retailers worldwide.  During fiscal year


	2013


	, the Company’s sales to its largest single customer, Tura Scandinavia AB, were approximately


	20%


	 of net sales and sales to Wal-Mart accounted for


	9%


	 of net sales.  In fiscal year


	2012


	, net sales to Tura Scandinavia AB and Wal-Mart, accounted for


	25%


	 and


	11%


	 of net sales, respectively.  The Company is dependent upon its ability to retain a base of retailers and distributors to sell the Company’s line of products.  Loss of retailers and distributors means loss of product placement.  The Company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores, mass merchants, and electronics stores.  Management believes that any loss of revenues would be partially offset by a corresponding decrease, on a percentage basis, in expenses; thereby partially reducing the impact on the Company’s income from operations.  The five largest customers of the Company (including Tura Scandinavia AB and Wal-Mart) accounted for approximately


	44%


	 and


	48%


	 of total net sales in fiscal years


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.









	The recently launched Striva product line is sold directly to consumers through the Koss website. This product line was launched late in fiscal year 2012 and sales of these products were not significant in fiscal year


	2013


	 or


	2012


	.




	 




	COMPETITION




	 




	The Company focuses on the stereo headphone industry.  In the stereo headphone market, the Company competes directly with approximately five major competitors, several of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the Company.  The extent to which retailers and consumers view the Company as an innovative vendor of high quality stereo headphone products, and a provider of excellent after sales customer service, is the extent to which the Company maintains a competitive advantage.  The Company relies upon its unique sound, quality workmanship, brand identification, engineering skills, and customer service to maintain its competitive position.









	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT




	 




	The amount expensed on engineering and research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products was


	$1,436,493


	 during fiscal year


	2013


	 as compared with


	$1,306,065


	 during fiscal year


	2012


	. These activities were conducted by both Company personnel and outside consultants.  The Company expects that research and development costs will continue and it is planning to introduce several new product offerings during fiscal year


	2014


	.




	 






	6















	ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS




	 




	The Company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject.  During the fiscal years


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, the amounts incurred in complying with federal, state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the Company’s operating results or financial condition.




	 




	EMPLOYEES




	 




	As of


	June 30, 2013


	, the Company employed


	61


	 people, who are all non-union.  The Company also engages temporary personnel.




	 




	FOREIGN SALES




	 




	The Company’s competitive position and risks relating to its business in foreign markets are comparable to those in the domestic market.  In addition, the governments of foreign nations may elect to erect trade barriers on imports.  The creation of additional barriers would reduce the Company’s net sales and net income.  In addition, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the Company’s products and divert customers who might choose to purchase lower-priced, less profitable products, and could affect overall demand for the Company’s products.  For further information, see Part II, Item 7 and Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.




	 




	The Company has a small sales office in Switzerland to service the international export marketplace.  The Company is not aware of any material risks in maintaining this operation.  Loss of this office would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility.  The Company sells its products to independent distributors in countries and regions outside the United States including Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, South America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Canada and Mexico.  During the last two fiscal years, net sales of all Koss products were distributed as follows:

	In addition to a manufacturing facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the Company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan and South Korea.  These independent suppliers are distant from the Company, which means that we are at risk of business interruptions due to natural disasters, war, disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically.  The Company maintains finished goods inventory in its U.S. facility to mitigate this risk.  The Company’s goal is to stock finished goods inventory at an average of approximately 90 days demand per item.  Recovery of a single facility through replacement of a supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take 120 days.  The Company believes that it could restore production of its top ten selling models (which represent approximately


	57%


	 of the Company’s


	2013


	 net sales) within one year.  The Company is also at risk if the trade




	restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin.  In addition, the Company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the Company’s customers, which would directly affect profits.

	AVAILABLE INFORMATION




	 




	The Company’s internet website is http://www.koss.com.  The Company makes available free of charge through its internet website the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with (or furnished to) the Securities and Exchange Commission.  These reports and other information regarding the Company are also available on the SEC’s internet website at http://www.sec.gov. The information on the Company's website is not part of this or any other report the Company files with or furnishes to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	PROPERTIES.




	 




	The Company leases its facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from its Board Chairman.  On


	May 15, 2012


	, the lease was renewed extending the expiration to


	June 30, 2018


	.  The lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of


	$380,000


	 per year and it is being accounted for as an operating lease.  The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes, and other normal expenses related to ownership.  All facilities are in good repair and, in the opinion of management, are suitable and adequate for the Company’s business purposes.

	The Company began paying dividends for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 and has paid a dividend for each quarter since, including the last fiscal quarter ended

	April 25, 2013


	 the Company announced its quarterly dividend of

	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.









	 




	The purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations, financial position, cash flows, indebtedness and other key financial information of the Company for fiscal years


	2013


	 and


	2012


	.  Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.




	 




	Overview




	 




	The Company developed stereo headphones in 1958 and has been a leader in the industry.  We market a complete line of high-fidelity stereo headphones, speaker-phones, computer headsets, telecommunications headsets, active noise canceling stereo headphones, wireless stereo headphones and compact disc recordings of American Symphony Orchestras on the Koss Classics label. We operate as one business segment.









	As headphones become more integral to use of music listening devices in the portable electronics market, the business volume becomes variable throughout the year. Changes in volume are more dependent on adding new customers or changes in economic conditions than they are on seasonality or the traditional holiday shopping season.









	Many of the Company's products could be viewed as essential by the consumer and others are more of a discretionary spend. The results of the Company's operations are therefore susceptible to consumer confidence and macroeconomic factors. These economic factors have been evident in results during fiscal year


	2013


	.









	As a result of the unauthorized transactions that the Company previously reported, the Company has on-going activity to recover the amounts lost in the unauthorized transactions. These activities are explained in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.









	Fiscal Year


	2013


	 Summary


















	•






	Net sales dropped


	5.5%


	 to


	$35,764,579


	 on volume declines at the top two customers.
















	•






	Gross profit as a percent of sales declined


	2.0%


	 to


	36.4%


	 due to a full year of amortization related to software development costs.
















	•






	Selling, general and administrative spending was higher due to costs of profit-based compensation and marketing costs.
















	•






	Unauthorized transaction related costs increased primarily due to legal expenses related to the settlement of a third party lawsuit.
















	•






	Unauthorized transaction related recoveries increased due to the


	$8,500,000


	 of gross proceeds from the settlement of a third party lawsuit and higher recoveries for sale of forfeited assets.

	2013


	 Results of Operations Compared with


	2012






	 




	Net sales for


	2013


	 declined due primarily to decreases in sales volume to a large distributor in Europe and to two large retailers in the United Sates. The decline in sales to the European distributor reflected the loss of a customer for most of fiscal year


	2013


	. This customer was regained late in the fiscal year. The decrease in the U.S. retail market reflects the increased number of competitors in this space and product placement at key retailers. Increased sales at two export customers in Asia helped to offset some of the decline at the European distributor and US retailers. In addition, new customers and introduction of new products throughout the year helped to reduce the sales declines.




	 




	Gross profit as a percent of sales in


	2013


	 was


	36.4%


	 which was


	2.0%


	 lower than


	2012


	. The decline in gross profit percentage was almost entirely the result of a full year of amortization of software development costs, which began at the end of fiscal year


	2012


	. Software amortization was $


	1,558,318


	 in fiscal year


	2013


	 compared to $


	142,867


	 in fiscal year


	2012


	. When adjusted for software amortization, gross profit increased by approximately 2% in fiscal year


	2013


	.









	Selling, general and administrative expenses for


	2013


	 were approximately $838,000 higher than


	2012


	. The majority of this increase was driven by profit-based compensation and spending for marketing, which increased by $461,643 and $274,179, respectively. The profit-based compensation increased as a result of the lawsuit settlement against the third party, which added approximately $702,000 to bonuses and profit sharing. The marketing costs increased due to more on-line advertising and promotion costs relating to the introduction of a new line of headphones.




	 




	In fiscal year


	2013


	, unauthorized transaction related costs increased because the Company incurred higher legal fees that were contingent on the settlement of the third party lawsuit against the Company's former auditors and additional costs of pursuing certain actions against other third parties. Included in the unauthorized transaction related recoveries for


	2013


	 was


	$8,500,000


	 of gross proceeds from the settlement of the lawsuit against the Company's former auditors,


	$1,670,487


	 from asset forfeitures, and


	$15,014


	 of insurance proceeds. Included in recoveries for


	2012


	 was


	$1,118,463


	 from asset forfeitures,


	$867,711


	 of insurance proceeds,


	$229,510


	 from garnishment of the 401(k) and Koss Employee Stock Ownership Trust (KESOT) balances held by Ms. Sachdeva, and a payment of


	$242,419


	 that the Company received from Michael Koss, who voluntarily reimbursed the Company for the excess portion of the bonus that he received during the restatement periods. 




	 




	The income from operations increased in


	2013


	 from


	2012


	 primarily due to income recorded from the settlement of the lawsuit against a third party. Without this settlement, income from operations decreased primarily due to decreased sales, decline in gross profit percentage and increased costs for marketing as described above.




	 




	In both


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, the Company decreased the interest it had accrued related to its tax reporting of the unauthorized transactions by


	$145,488


	 and


	$251,485


	, respectively. The Company reversed accrued interest related to the tax returns as they were filed and based upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain returns. These impacts are described further in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.






	11






















	The effective income tax rate was lower than statutory rates in


	2013


	 primarily due to a decrease in the liability for uncertain tax positions. It is anticipated that the effective income tax rate would be approximately 30% in


	2014


	.

	Operating Activities




	 




	During


	2013


	, cash provided by operations decreased primarily due to the negative changes in operating assets and liabilities offsetting the increase in net income. Accounts receivable increased by


	$6,858,625


	 as of June 30, 2013 compared to June 30, 2012. The proceeds of


	$8,500,000


	 from the lawsuit settlement, received in July 2013, were in accounts receivable at June 30, 2013 which more than offset the accounts receivable decrease from customers. The legal fees, related to the lawsuit settlement, were


	$2,120,000


	 and were recorded in accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2013. In addition, inventory increased by


	$1,104,822


	. Inventory was higher due to stocking of new products in advance of shipments and adding inventory to support the launch of the Striva product line.




	 




	Investing Activities




	 




	Cash used in investing activities was lower for


	2013


	 as the Company made no new investments in product software compared to investments of


	$1,145,106


	 in


	2012


	. In


	2014


	, the Company has budgeted $1,200,000 for tooling and leasehold improvements.  The Company expects to generate sufficient funds through operations to fund these expenditures.




	 




	Financing Activities




	 




	Net cash used in financing activities decreased in


	2013


	 because the Company paid off the borrowings on its bank line of credit in


	2012


	. Dividends paid to stockholders stayed the same at


	$1,771,849


	 or


	$0.24


	 per share in


	2013


	.  The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future.  As of


	June 30, 2013


	, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank line of credit facility.  On July 31,


	2013


	, the Company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank line of credit facility and availability of approximately $8,000,000.




	 




	There were no purchases of common stock in


	2013


	 or


	2012


	 under the stock repurchase program.  No stock options were exercised in


	2013


	 or


	2012


	.




	 




	Liquidity




	 




	In addition to capital expenditures for tooling and continued investment in software development, the Company has interest payments on its line of credit facility borrowings, and planned normal quarterly dividend payments. The Company believes that cash generated from operations, together with borrowings available under its credit facility, provide it with adequate liquidity to meet operating requirements, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, and dividend payments.  Management believes that the long-term outlook for the business remains positive, however, the Company continually reevaluates new product offerings, inventory levels and capital expenditures to ensure that it is effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions.











	12






















	Credit Facility




	 




	On May 12, 2010, the Company entered into a secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Lender”).  The Credit Agreement dated May 12, 2010 between the Company and the Lender (“Credit Agreement”) provides for an


	$8,000,000


	 revolving secured credit facility and for letters of credit for the benefit of the Company of up to a sublimit of


	$2,000,000


	.  On July 24, 2013, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the expiration to July 31, 2015.  The Company and the Lender also entered into the Pledge and Security Agreement dated May 12, 2010 under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets in connection with the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement.  The balance on this facility was


	$0


	 and


	$0


	 as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.




	 




	Stock Repurchase Program




	 




	In April 1995, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase from time to time up to


	$2,000,000


	 of its common stock for its own account.  Subsequently, the Board of Directors periodically has approved increases of between $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 in the stock repurchase program.  As of


	June 30, 2013


	, the most recently approved increase was for additional purchases of


	$2,000,000


	, which occurred in October 2006, for an aggregate maximum of


	$45,500,000


	, of which


	$43,360,247


	 had been expended through


	June 30, 2013


	.  The Company intends to effect all stock purchases either on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and intends to finance all stock purchases through its own cash flow or by borrowing for such purchases.




	 




	There were no stock repurchases under the program in fiscal years


	2013


	 and


	2012


	.  As of


	June 30, 2013


	, the Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase by the Company of up to


	$2,139,753


	 in Company common stock at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Future stock purchases under this program are dependent on management’s assessment of value versus market price.




	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 




	The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements other than the lease for the facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which it leases from its Chairman.  On


	May 15, 2012


	, the lease was renewed for a period of


	five


	 years, ending


	June 30, 2018


	, and is being accounted for as an operating lease.  The lease extension maintained the rent at a fixed rate of


	$380,000


	 per year.  The Company is responsible for all property maintenance, insurance, taxes and other normal expenses related to ownership.  The facility is in good repair and, in the opinion of management, is suitable and adequate for the Company’s business purposes.




	 




	Critical Accounting Policies




	 




	Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We continually evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to doubtful accounts, product returns, excess inventories, warranties, impairment of long-lived assets, deferred compensation, income taxes and other contingencies.  We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.









	Revenue Recognition




	 




	The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; shipment and delivery has occurred; the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured.  When these criteria are generally satisfied, the Company recognizes revenue.  The Company also offers certain customers the right to return products that do not meet the standards agreed with the customer.  The Company continuously monitors such product returns and cannot guarantee that they will continue to experience the same return rates that they have experienced in the past.  Any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize.




	 




	The Company provides for certain sales incentives.  The Company records a provision for estimated incentives based upon the incentives offered to customers on product related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded.  The provision is recorded as a reduction of sales.  The Company also records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded.  These estimates are based on historical sales






	13

















	returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors.  If the historical data the Company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns, adjustments may be required in future periods.

	The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer’s current credit worthiness, as determined by the review of the customer’s current credit information.  The Company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the Company’s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified.  Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.  The allowance is calculated based upon the Company’s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the Company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations.  In these cases, management uses its judgment, based on the best available facts and circumstances and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected.  These specific reserves are re-evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved.  However, the ultimate collectibility of the unsecured receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer, which could change rapidly and without warning.




	 




	Inventories




	 




	The Company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market.  Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method.  As of


	June 30, 2013


	, 100% of the Company’s inventory was valued using LIFO.  Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment.  The Company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past.  Our customers may cancel their orders or change purchase volumes.  This, or certain additional actions or market developments, could create excess inventory levels, which would impact the valuation of our inventories.  Any actions taken by our customers or market developments that could impact the value of our inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations.  The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical and projected usage and production requirements.  If the Company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value, the Company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly.









	Product Software Development Costs




	 




	Product software development costs consist of costs incurred by outside parties for the development of software embedded in or used to support new products.  These assets have been evaluated to ensure that the capitalized costs do not exceed the estimated net realizable value of the related products.  As part of the impairment analysis, we use an undiscounted cash flow model based on estimated net sales and gross profit to be derived in the future from the specific product and other estimated costs directly related to the product.  Amortization was started in fiscal year


	2012


	 with introduction of the first products at the end of April


	2012


	. No amortization was recorded prior to the introduction of the new products. 




	 




	Inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates, projected future costs, costs to complete and projected long-term growth rates.  The Company performed impairment testing as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	 and no impairment was identified.




	 




	Product Warranty Obligations




	 




	Products, with the exception of Striva, are generally covered by a lifetime warranty.  The Striva products carry a


	90


	 day warranty. We record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior product returns experience.  Warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized.  These warranty costs are based upon management’s assessment of past claims and current experience.  However, actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated, as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty.




	 




	Income Taxes




	 




	We estimate a provision for income taxes based on the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year.  If the actual results are different from these estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made.  Additionally, discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized.




	 






	14

















	Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates.  Deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period.  Additionally, we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred income tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the “more likely than not” criteria.

	Disclosure Controls and Procedures.




	 




	Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are designed to ensure that (1) information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (2) that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.




	 




	The Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of


	June 30, 2013


	.  The Company’s management has concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of


	June 30, 2013


	 were effective.









	Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting


	.




	 




	The Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) and designing such internal controls to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error or the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving its control objectives.









	Management conducted its evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In connection with this evaluation, there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2013 was effective.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 




	To the Board of Directors




	Koss Corporation




	Milwaukee, Wisconsin




	 




	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Koss Corporation and Subsidiary (the “Company”) as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of its internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Koss Corporation and Subsidiary as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.




	 




	As discussed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has been named in several legal matters.  In addition, the Company has also initiated certain legal actions against third parties.

	KOSS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY






	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
















	1.


	                                      


	 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 




	NATURE OF BUSINESS — Koss Corporation (“Koss”) and its former


	100%


	-owned subsidiary (collectively the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, reports its finances as a single reporting segment, as the Company’s principal business line is the design, manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories.  The Company leases its plant and office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  In addition, the Company has more than


	300


	 domestic dealers and its products are carried by approximately


	17,000


	 domestic retailers and numerous retailers worldwide.  International markets are served by domestic sales representatives and a sales office in Switzerland which utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries.  The Company had one subsidiary, Koss Classics Ltd. (“Koss Classics”), which was dissolved in the three months ended September 30, 2011.




	 




	BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION — The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Koss and its subsidiary, Koss Classics, which was a


	100%


	-owned subsidiary.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.




	 




	REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue is recognized by the Company upon shipment of product, which is generally when title passes to the customer, the price is fixed and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Provisions for slotting fees, cooperative advertising programs, rebates, sales discounts, estimated returns and allowances, and other estimated costs are provided for in the same period the sales are recorded.  These provisions are recorded as a reduction to sales.




	 




	SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AND COSTS — Shipping and handling costs charged to customers have been included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs incurred by the Company have been included in cost of goods sold.




	 




	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT — Research and development activities charged to operations as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income amounted to $


	1,436,493


	 in fiscal year


	2013


	 and $


	1,306,065


	 in fiscal year


	2012


	.




	 




	ADVERTISING COSTS — Advertising costs included within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income were $


	230,455


	 in


	2013


	 and $


	116,610


	 in


	2012


	.  Such costs are expensed as incurred.









	INCOME TAXES — The Company operates as a C Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The differences relate principally to different methods used for depreciation and amortization for income tax purposes, net operating losses, capitalization requirements of the Code, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation methods, unauthorized transactions, stock based compensation, warranty reserves, and other income tax related carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.




	 




	INCOME PER COMMON SHARE — Income per common share is calculated under the provisions of Topic 260 in the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” income per share.  Basic income per common share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted income per common share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.




	 




	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS — The Company considers depository accounts and investments with a maturity at the date of acquisition and expected usage of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.  The Company maintains its cash on deposit at commercial banks located in the United States of America.  The Company periodically has cash balances in excess of insured amounts.  The Company has not experienced and does not expect to incur any losses on these deposits.




	 






	23















	ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE — Accounts receivable consists of unsecured trade receivables due from customers.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for significant past due receivable balances based on a review of the past due item, general economic conditions and the insurance coverage in place.  See Note 3 for additional information on accounts receivable.




	 




	INVENTORIES — The Company’s inventory was valued at the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market.  The carrying value of inventory is reviewed for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or more frequently if warranted due to changes in market conditions. See Note 4 for additional information on inventory.









	EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS — Equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.  Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.  Major expenditures for property and equipment and significant renewals are capitalized.  Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred.  When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, their costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gains or losses are included in operations.




	 




	PRODUCT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS — The Company follows the guidance of ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed” when capitalizing software development costs associated with software embedded in or to be incorporated into its products.  The cost of purchased software technology is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value.  At a minimum, we review for impairment on a quarterly basis.  Amortization is being recorded over a three year period or a fixed amount per unit sold, whichever is greater. See Note 6 for additional information.




	 




	LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES — Life insurance policies are stated at cash surrender value or at the amount the Company would receive in the case of split-dollar arrangements.  Increases in cash surrender value are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, which is where the annual premiums are recorded. 




	 




	PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS — Estimated future warranty costs related to products are charged to cost of goods sold during the period the related revenue is recognized. The product warranty liability reflects the Company’s best estimate of probable obligations under those warranties. See Note 10 for additional information on product warranty obligations.




	 




	DEFERRED COMPENSATION — The Company’s deferred compensation liabilities are for a current and former officer and are calculated based on compensation, years of service and mortality tables.  The related expense is calculated using the net present value of the expected payments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 11 for additional information on deferred compensation.




	 




	FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS — Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value based on the short maturity of these instruments.




	 




	IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS — The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.  The Company evaluates the recoverability of equipment and leasehold improvements annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.  If an asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.  Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.  Management determines fair value using a discounted future cash flow analysis or other accepted valuation techniques.  Management believes that there has not been any impairment of the Company’s long-lived assets as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	.




	 




	LEGAL COSTS — All legal costs related to litigation are charged to operations as incurred, except settlements, which are expensed when a claim is probable and can be estimated.  Recoveries of legal costs are recorded when the amount and items to be paid are confirmed by the insurance company.  Proceeds from the settlement of legal disputes are recorded in income when the amounts are determinable and the collection is reasonably assured.









	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION — The Company has a stock-based employee compensation plan, which is described more fully in Note 14.  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718 "Compensation - Stock Compensation".  Under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement, share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. 




	 






	24















	USE OF ESTIMATES — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 




	RECLASSIFICATIONS — Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.











	2.             UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTION RELATED RECOVERIES




	 




	In December 2009, the Company learned of significant unauthorized transactions, which totaled approximately $


	31,500,000


	 from fiscal years 2005 through December 2009 as previously reported.  The Company has ongoing costs and recoveries associated with the unauthorized transactions. For the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, the costs incurred were for legal defense costs and legal fees related to claims initiated against third parties (see Note 20). The Company has received various recoveries related to the unauthorized transactions which are summarized below. The insurance proceeds covered the majority of the legal defense costs relating to defending the actions and investigations against the Company. The Company will continue to incur legal fees for the claims initiated against third parties. There have been other recoveries of the assets previously owned and forfeited by the former Vice President of Finance. The Company expects to receive additional forfeiture related funds in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014.  For the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, these costs and recoveries were as follows:

	 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE




	 




	Accounts receivable includes unsecured trade receivables due from customers.  In addition, at


	June 30, 2013


	, accounts receivable included


	$8,500,000


	 of proceeds from the settlement of the lawsuit against a third party (see Notes 2 and 20).









	The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral to establish an account receivable.  The majority of open accounts, excluding primarily Wal-Mart, are covered by credit insurance. Accounts receivable from our two largest customers represented


	20.5%


	 and


	31.4%


	 of gross trade accounts receivable as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.









	The Company evaluates collectibility of accounts receivable based on a number of factors.  Accounts receivable are considered to be past due if unpaid one day after their due date.  An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for past due receivable balances based on a review of the past due item, general economic conditions and the insurance coverage in place.  The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible.  There were no recoveries of previously written-off accounts receivable during fiscal


	2013


	 or fiscal


	2012


	.  Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows:

	The vast majority of international customers, outside of Canada, are sold to on a cash against documents or cash in advance basis. Approximately


	16%


	 and


	32%


	 of the Company's trade accounts receivable at


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, were foreign receivables denominated in U.S. dollars.

	 INVENTORIES




	 




	As of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, the Company’s inventory was valued using the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market.  If the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of inventory accounting had been used by the Company for inventories valued at LIFO, inventories would have been $


	1,313,498


	 and $


	1,158,119


	 higher than reported at


	June 30, 2013


	 and

	 PRODUCT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES




	 




	The Company follows the guidance of ASC 985-20 “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed” when capitalizing software development costs associated with software embedded in or to be incorporated into its products.  The cost of purchased software technology is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value.  Software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products, services and pricing.  Such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our product software development costs and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life.  Such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurs or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations. At a minimum, we review for impairment on a quarterly basis.  The Company launched a new product offering in 2012 and began amortization of the related capitalized software. Amortization is being recorded over a


	three


	 year period or a fixed amount per unit sold, whichever is greater. Changes in the product software development costs net of accumulated amortization were as follows:

	7.             INCOME TAXES




	 




	The Company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  The liability method measures the expected income tax impact of future taxable income and deductions implicit in the consolidated balance sheets.  The income tax provision in


	2013


	 and


	2012


	 consisted of the following:

	Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.  These differences are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.  The recognition of these deferred tax balances will be realized through normal recurring operations and, as such, the Company has recorded the full value of such expected benefits. The Company utilized all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards in the state of Wisconsin totaling $


	3,997,796


	 which expire in fiscal year


	2025


	.




	 




	ASC Topic 740 "Income Taxes" prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.  There were no additional significant matters determined to be unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that have been recorded on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended


	June 30, 2013


	.  As part of the unauthorized transactions, the Company has accrued interest of


	$49,150


	 and


	$150,624


	 as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.

	$






	150,624

















	 




	Additionally, ASC Topic 740 provides guidance on the recognition of interest and penalties related to income taxes.  There were no penalties related to income taxes that have been accrued or recognized as of and for the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	.  The Company records interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense.  For the year ended


	June 30, 2013


	, the Company decreased the interest it had accrued related to its tax reporting of the unauthorized transactions. The Company reversed the accrued interest related to the tax return that was filed for the year ended June 30, 2007 because the






	28















	statute of limitations expired for this return. During the year ended


	June 30, 2013


	, the Company accrued interest related to the tax reporting of the unauthorized transactions for years ending after June 30, 2007.




	 




	A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:




	 



































	 






	 






	2013






	 






	2012








	Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year






	 






	$

	Gross increases - tax positions in prior years






	 






	—













	 






	546,113















	Reductions due to lapse in statute






	 






	(249,938






	)

	Reductions based on settlements with taxing authorities

	Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year






	 






	$






	696,113













	 






	$






	1,146,051

















	 




	All of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	 would affect the effective tax rate. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that federal and state tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits and income tax expense by up to


	$550,000


	, either because the Company's tax positions are sustained on audit or settled, or the applicable statute of limitations closes.









	The Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and in several state jurisdictions.  The Company’s federal tax returns through tax year June 30, 2007 are settled and the income tax returns for tax years beginning July 1, 2007 are open.  For states in which the Company files state income tax returns, the statue of limitations is generally open for tax years ended June 30, 2008 and forward.  The Company is not currently under examination in any jurisdiction.

	 CREDIT FACILITY




	 




	On May 12, 2010, the Company entered into a secured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“Lender”).  The Credit Agreement dated May 12, 2010 between the Company and the Lender (“Credit Agreement”) provides for an


	$8,000,000


	 revolving secured credit facility with interest rates either ranging from


	0.0%


	 to


	0.75%


	 over the Lender’s most recently publicly announced prime rate or


	2.0%


	 to


	3.0%


	 over LIBOR, depending on the Company’s leverage ratio.  The Company pays a fee of


	0.3%


	 to


	0.45%


	 for unused amounts committed in the credit facility.  On July 24, 2013, the Credit Agreement was amended to extend the expiration to July 31, 2015. In addition to the revolving loans, the Credit Agreement also provides that the Company may, from time to time, request the Lender to issue letters of credit for the benefit of the Company of up to a sublimit of


	$2,000,000


	 and subject to certain other limitations.  The loans may be used only for general corporate purposes of the Company.




	 




	The Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type.  The negative covenants include restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, certain investments, asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates, among other restrictions.  The financial covenants include a minimum current ratio, minimum tangible net worth and maximum leverage ratio requirements.  The Company and the Lender also entered into the Pledge and Security Agreement dated May 12, 2010 under which the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of the Company’s assets in connection with the Company’s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The balance on this facility was


	$0


	 as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and

	10.           PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS




	 




	The Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale based upon historical warranty experience.  The Company’s products carry a lifetime warranty except for the recently launched Striva product line which has a


	90


	 day warranty.  The Company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimated.  The Company’s current and non-current product warranty obligations are included in accrued liabilities and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets.  However, the Company is continuously releasing new and more complex and technologically advanced products. Even though some of these products have a shorter warranty period, it is at least reasonably possible that products could be released with certain unknown quality or design problems resulting in higher than expected warranty and related costs. These costs could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the near term.









	Changes to the product warranty obligations for the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and

	 DEFERRED COMPENSATION




	 




	The Company has deferred compensation agreements with a former and current officer. The related expense is calculated using the net present value of the expected payments and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The net present value was calculated for the former officer using a discount factor of


	2.06%


	 and


	5.60%


	 as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively. The net present value was calculated for the current officer using a discount factor of


	4.85%


	 and


	5.60%


	 at


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.




	 




	The Board of Directors entered into an agreement to continue the Chairman’s 1991 base salary for the remainder of his life.  These payments begin upon the Chairman’s retirement, and since the Chairman has not retired, he is not currently receiving any payments under this arrangement.  The Company has a deferred compensation liability of $


	501,923


	 and $


	622,503


	 recorded as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.  Deferred compensation expense reversal of $


	120,580


	 was recognized under this arrangement in


	2013


	 and deferred compensation expense of $


	46,038


	 was recognized in


	2012


	.




	 






	30















	The Board of Directors has approved a supplemental retirement plan with an officer that calls for annual cash compensation following retirement from the Company in an amount equal to


	2%


	 of base salary, as defined in the agreement, multiplied by the number of years of service to the Company.  The retirement payments are to be paid monthly to the officer until his death and then to his surviving spouse monthly until her death.  The Company has a deferred compensation liability of $


	1,873,627


	 and $


	1,573,817


	 recorded as of


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.  Deferred compensation expense of $


	299,810


	 and $


	171,964


	 was recognized under this arrangement in


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.




	 




	The Company uses life insurance policies to provide funds to meet its deferred compensation obligations.













	12.    INTEREST EXPENSE









	The Company incurs interest expense primarily related to its secured credit facility (see Note 8) and to its liabilities for its tax positions related to the unauthorized transactions. As the tax returns have been settled and statute of limitations have expired, the accrued interest expense on certain items has been reversed. Interest expense detail was as follows for the fiscal years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively:

	13.             INCOME PER COMMON AND COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENT SHARE




	 




	Basic income per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding was


	7,382,706


	 for the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	.  When dilutive, stock options are included in income per share as share equivalents using the treasury stock method.  For the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	 there were no common stock equivalents related to stock option grants that were included in the computation of the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for diluted income per share.  Shares under option of


	1,741,000


	 and


	1,514,308


	 were excluded from the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively, as they would be anti-dilutive.











	14.


	                                      


	 STOCK OPTIONS




	 




	In 2012, pursuant to the recommendation of the Board of Directors, the stockholders ratified the creation of the Company’s 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), which superseded the 1990 Flexible Incentive Plan (the "1990 Plan").  The 2012 Plan is administered by a committee of the Board of Directors and provides for granting of various stock-based awards including stock options to eligible participants, primarily officers and certain key employees.  A total of


	2,000,000


	 shares of common stock were available under the terms of the 2012 Plan plus shares outstanding under the 1990 Plan which expire or are otherwise forfeited, canceled or terminated after July 25, 2012, the Effective Date of the 2012 Plan.  As of


	June 30, 2013


	, there were


	1,773,308


	 options available for future grants.  Options vest over a


	three


	 to


	five


	 year period from the date of grant, with a maximum term of


	five


	 to


	ten


	 years.









	The fair value of each stock option grant was estimated as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model.  The resulting compensation cost for fixed awards with graded vesting schedules is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.  The expected term of awards granted is determined based on historical experience with similar awards, giving consideration to the expected term and vesting schedules.  The expected volatility is determined based on the Company’s historical stock prices over the most recent period commensurate with the expected term of the award.  The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term commensurate with the expected term of the award.  Expected pre-vesting option forfeitures are based on historical data.




	 




	As of


	June 30, 2013


	, there was approximately $


	1,235,324


	 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the 2012 Plan and 1990 Plan.  This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of


	2.71


	 years.  Total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated and actual forfeitures.   The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $


	583,069


	 and $


	480,623


	 in


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, respectively.  These expenses were included in selling, general and administrative expenses.




	 






	31















	There was no cash received from stock option exercises during


	2013


	 or


	2012


	.




	 




	The per share weighted average fair value of the stock options granted during the years ended


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	 were $


	1.67


	 and $


	1.99


	, respectively.  The fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  For the options granted in


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, the Company used the following weighted-average assumptions:

	15.             STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTS




	 




	The Company has an agreement with its Chairman, John C. Koss, in the event of his death, at the request of the executor of his estate, to repurchase his Company common stock from his estate.  The Company does not have the right to require the estate to sell stock to the Company.  As such, this arrangement is accounted for as a written put option with the fair value of the put option recorded as a derivative liability.




	 




	The fair value of the written put option at


	June 30, 2013


	 and


	2012


	 was $


	154,745


	 and $


	135,333


	, respectively.  The repurchase price is


	95%


	 of the fair market value of the common stock on the date that notice to repurchase is provided to the Company.  The total number of shares to be repurchased will be sufficient to provide proceeds which are the lesser of $


	2,500,000


	 or the amount of estate taxes and administrative expenses incurred by the Chairman’s estate.  The Company may elect to pay the purchase price in cash or may elect to pay cash equal to


	25%


	 of the total amount due and to execute a promissory note for the balance, payable over


	four


	 years, at the prime rate of interest.  The Company maintains a $


	1,150,000


	 life insurance policy to fund a substantial portion of this obligation.




	 




	In April 1995, the Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase from time to time up to $


	2,000,000


	 of its common stock for its own account.  Subsequently, the Board of Directors periodically has approved increases in the amount authorized for repurchase under the program.  As of


	June 30, 2013


	, the Board had authorized the repurchase of an aggregate of


	$45,500,000


	 of common stock under the stock repurchase program, of which


	$43,360,247


	 had been expended. No shares were repurchased in


	2013


	 or


	2012


	.

	The Company maintains a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.  This plan covers all employees of the Company who have completed one full fiscal quarter of service.  Matching contributions can be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  For fiscal years


	2013


	 and


	2012


	, the matching contribution was


	100%


	 of employee contributions to the plan.  Vesting of Company contributions occurs immediately.  Company contributions were $


	425,301


	 and $

	20.           LEGAL MATTERS




	 




	As of


	June 30, 2013


	, the Company is party to the matters related to the unauthorized transactions described below:




	 




	 













	•






	On February 18, 2010, the Company filed an action against American Express Company, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc., AMEX Card Services Company, Decision Science, and Pamela S. Hopkins in Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, case no. CV2010-006631, alleging various claims of aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting fraud, conversion, and negligence relating to the unauthorized transactions.  American Express filed a Motion to Dismiss the claims that the Company filed, and the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss.  The Company filed a Motion for New Trial requesting that the Court reconsider its prior ruling that granted the Motion to Dismiss, and the Court denied the Motion for New Trial.  The Company appealed this decision, and the case is currently pending on appeal.







	 













	•






	On June 24, 2010, the Company filed an action against its former independent auditor, Grant Thornton, LLP, and Ms. Sachdeva, in Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleging various claims of accounting malpractice, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud relating to the unauthorized transactions.  In June 2013, the Company executed a settlement agreement that settled this lawsuit and as part of the settlement, the parties provided mutual releases that resolved all claims involved in the litigation between the Company and its Directors against Grant Thornton, LLP. Pursuant to the settlement, in July 2013 the Company received gross proceeds of


	$8,500,000


	, or


	$6,380,000


	 net of associated legal fees. See Notes 2 and 3 for more information relating to this recovery.







	 













	•






	On December 17, 2010, the Company filed an action against Park Bank in Circuit Court of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin alleging claims of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty relating to the unauthorized transactions. 







	 




	The ultimate resolution of these matters is not determinable unless otherwise noted.

Koss Corp. releases new product amid fiscal setbacks
by
							BizTimes Staff September 29, 2014, 12:00 AM

On the heels of Koss Corp.’s announcement that it experienced a drop in sales and is halting production in Mexico, the company has released a new product, the BT540i Wireless Bluetooth headphone.
Featuring state-of-the-art Bluetooth hardware and software integrated with aptX codec technology, the Koss BT540i is said to be the Milwaukee-based company’s most advanced Bluetooth headphone. It features built-in, dual microphones that work in sync to reduce background noise and on-board controls that allow listeners to quickly navigate through songs, play or pause music, volume-up, volume-down and answer incoming calls.
Koss Corp.’s recent fiscal fourth quarter earnings report detailed its setbacks, which included a 12-month net loss of $5.6 million, compared with a net income of $5.4 million a year earlier. In addition, the company’s quarterly sales dipped to $6.2 million from $9.9 million a year earlier.
“The company had extremely disappointing results in the past fiscal year and in the quarter ended June 30, 2014,” said Michael Koss, president and chief executive officer. “We experienced major setbacks in export sales, particularly in Europe. That drop in sales was significant enough for us to suspend operations in Mexico until sales volumes support enough demand for the products being produced there. In addition, with the changes that need to be made to the Striva Wi-Fi headphone technology, we wrote off the capitalized software costs as well as the related tooling and inventory. These three factors resulted in a significant loss in fiscal year 2014.”

“The company had extremely disappointing results in the past fiscal year and in the quarter ended June 30, 2014,” said Michael Koss, president and chief executive officer. “We experienced major setbacks in export sales, particularly in Europe. That drop in sales was significant enough for us to suspend operations in Mexico until sales volumes support enough demand for the products being produced there. In addition, with the changes that need to be made to the Striva Wi-Fi headphone technology, we wrote off the capitalized software costs as well as the related tooling and inventory. These three factors resulted in a significant loss in fiscal year 2014.”

				   Amazing sound but not amazing build quality				








Overall










					First of all, these headphones sound amazing. Much better than the Sennheiser HD650s. I do wish that the were a little tighter on my head though. But they are very light and comfortable. The bottom line is that they sound amazing.

				   The Headphone equivalent of the 'Monolith' from 2001: A Space Odyssey				








Overall










					These Electrostatic headphones are an incredible value, objectively providing broadband linearity and a uniform amplitude response across the key audible spectrum. Orthogonal transducers,especially of the electrostatic variety like this are generally many thousands of dollars as an entry price point in comparison.

The ESP950's transducers have an enormous planar area - one of the largest ever  in a pair of headphones to my  knowledge - they cover the sides of your head from hair to jawline! Despite this, they are very lightweight (the mylar diaphragm is so thin it is transparent!) and are truly an open headphone in a sense that traditional dynamic headphones simply cannot claim to be.

The resulting sound is not only highly accurate, the massive scale and transparent airiness combines to provide a truly breathtaking listening experience. While many headphones claim to reproduce the experience of listening at a concert, these do a better job than most speakers of that scale can claim. . . it's more like listening to your recordings as they sounded in the studio itself. 

Finally, the lifetime warranty on these is excellent peace of mind. I simply couldn't imagine investing this much into a pair of headphones without having Koss' legendary warranty to back it up.

				   Still great after 20 years of use!				








Overall










					I purchased these back in 1994,  other than ear pad replaments, they have been flawless.   These are still the best headphones I have ever owned.   They are very smooth from top to bottom.  Plenty of detail with the as well.  The bass is well extended, not boomy.  The mids are as clean as you can get.  They highs are crystalyn but not bright.   The only drawback I can think of is they can make the our ears sweat after a while.   The construction seems a bit flimsy, but they have held up nice for me.   Better than my ancient Stax electret I still have.

				   Electrostatics, A Pure Sound Source				








Overall










					As a professional recording engineer & audio purist, I've always wanted a pair of ESP950 headphones. Once I purchased a set, I was mesmerized by the sound quality. If you elect to hear crystal clear music without coloration or over-emphasized bass, then these are the headphones of choice. You'll notice subtleties you didn't know existed in your recordings. Other headphones mask what's really there. Dynamic headphones can't mach the sound quality of electrostatic headphones. The are well worth the investment.

Pros: Transparent Sound Quality

Cons: None

				   A true bargain				








Overall










					I actually own 2 pair of these and have one hooked to my 2 channel audio only stereo and one to my a/v system. These headphones provide absolutely unmatched sound reproduction at a price that is very low for the technology involved. The depth of the soundstage is exactly as the recording engineers first intended. They have to be heard to be appreciated.

Pros: Unparalleled sound reproduction

Cons: Unparalleled sound reproduction

				   Outstanding Sound, with Comfort				








Overall










					I have owned these for 10 to 20 years and used the warranty at least once, at which time the drivers were renewed. I felt guilty spending so much on a set of headphones - until I heard them, after which I never regretted the purchase. My speakers include a pair of time-corrected (with digital crossovers) K-horns in a 5.1 system, a pair of Dayton-Wright electrostatics in another 5.1 system, and a pair of Ambience ribbon speakers in a 2.1 system. All excellent, but none better than these headphones.

Pros: Excellent sound, gorgeous midrange, true bass

Cons: Open design with little attenuation of ambient noise					

						Review by SAB						/
					   (Posted on 2/14/2014)					


				   Heavenly				








Overall










					These are some of the best high-end headphones out there. The sound of these phones is full and natural. No heavy bass or bright highs. You can listen all night long. They are very comfortable, and lightweight. Pricey, but there are deals out there. The 950 have a very open sound, which is a bit different from other headphones I have.

Pros: midrange to die for!

Cons: NONE

				   THE BEST THERE IS				








Overall










					I've had these for 20 years now and love them. If you are into private listening with fullness and detail you should have a set of these. I am looking to buy a 2nd pair for my other stereo. They really stand behind the product. I had a problem once and they replaced them no questions asked.

Pros: Everything

Cons: None

				   Koss electrostatic head phones				








Overall










					Awesome head phones if you have the money to buy them. They sound great if you run a tube amp in to them. The high, mids, lows sound great! They have a free lifetime warranty.

Pros: great sound, every things

Cons: Big

				   Been using them since the 1970's				








Overall










					I've been using these stereophones since the 1970's, when Mr. Koss (John, the founder) gave them to me as a gift....my dad and him were friends. I was a young teenage DJ at WOMT 1240 Radio in Manitowoc, WI. I was the envy of the staff. They all used old tinny headsets, and mine sounded great. I eventually I ended up in Dallas, and then LA, then back to WI, and the Pro4AA's have followed me around the country. They're still awesome!

				   Still the gold standard.				








Overall










					I have had a pair of these headphones for fifteen years.  They still sound better than nearly anything on the market, and won't put you back as much as some of the flashier names.  Even if you do have problems with them, the lifetime guarnetee is there to make sure you're covered. These are the only headphones I recommend for any serious work.  Accept no substitute.

				   There is nothing else				








Overall










					I first encountered the Pro4AA's when I first started working in broadcasting as the station I worked at had 12 pairs and was amazed by the accuracy and durability. At that time I was doing some of the longest weekend shifts and would have them on 12 to 14 hours at a time sometimes and and many hours in production and editing as well. The only problem they had back then was the ear cushions were oil filled and the other problem was women and hair products. The cushions would tend to harden and eventually crack because of the hair chemicals and our own natural body hair oil and sweat. Around that time Koss implemented a improvement made with a different grade of polymer to overcome that and they are no longer oil filled. Our engineering department had an open account with them for parts and we did all our own repairs and I have serviced many sets through the years for either damaged cables or cushions or user imposed damages but the drivers and frames were usually never an issue and these would get beat and worked hard every day. In the 80s I owned both a pair of double and triple A's and lost them in a relationship split, suffice to say I miss the headphones :) I still work live sound and I have used dozens of other brands but nothing even comes close to the sound and durability of the AA's and 40 years later I am looking at a set of the Titaniums. The AA's are a bit heavy but that's part of their sound and what keeps them immune to the outside sounds around you and thats what real metal feels like which is why they last. There is nothing better for accurate sound reproduction and detail and day in day out durability. I live 80 miles from where they are made and they have always stood behind every piece of the products they make. This is the definition of legendary, which is why they have stood the test of time. Make no mistake, there is nothing else......other than maybe a different model more suited for your needs but these were the catalyst of it all and all the other manufacturers worldwide have been chasing them ever since.

				   A top-grade classic!				








Overall










					I bought my first pair of Koss Pro 4 AA 'phones back in the middle '70s, while employed selling stereo gear. They were outstanding performers then and a great value for the price, and still are! No wonder the model has lasted this long! My original pair finally gave out in 2013, after A 37-year life span!

				   Best Headphones I've ever used				








Overall










					I have owned and used the Pro4A headphones since I was in the USAF in 1970. They were dutifully repaired one time under warranty and perform extremely well. Much better than other 'phones I've used it garbs the nuances of source and especially the transcribed music from my Linn Sondek turntable.					

						Review by Rick 						/
					   (Posted on 2/24/2016)					


				   Design Classic (great sound but not for mobile devices)				








Overall










					I have two pairs bought approx 10 years apart which have radically different voice coil impedance. The 1974 pair have impedance of 22 ohms and the 1984 pair 220 ohms. I believe current production voice coils are 250 ohms. The 22 ohm pair are easy to drive and give acceptable SPL from iOS devices and mobile phones. The others do not and therefore require a portable headphone amplifier to give adequate SPL on mobile devices.

Regarding the Lifetime Warranty (or should that read Limited Lifetime Warranty?), I have had no response to my request to have both pairs repaired as the plastic guides for the headphone bands have both broken. It is always very disappointing when manufacturer claims are not met. I will update my review if Koss honour their lifetime warranty promise.

				   Pro 4AA				








Overall










					Understand they are 'studio' headphones, extra connection port, etc. I bought my 1st set WAY back in late 1972/early 1973. While in the service, shipped them 3X across country--they were flawless. The oil-filled pads wore out. Bought the 2nd set from Sam Goody's in NYC after 4+ years. Had NO idea about the warranty at the time. NEXT set WILL be, again, PRO4AA's!!!

Pros: BEST quality sound I've had since 1973

Cons: Weight (but I can live with it)

				   This is it!				








Overall










					To this day I won't settle for any other brand than Koss & these headphones are the reason! I bought mine around 1976 in CA but they, along with my entire music collection were stolen in 1979. Recommend, heck Yeah!!

Pros: This is the ideal, the one against all others are judged

Cons: The price (When I bought mine they were about $30)

				   Pro 4AA				








Overall










					Bought these in 1978. Used them until they were worn out at least 20yrs. had them in a cabinet for years then found out they were guaranteed for life .Sent them back to Koss and they sent me a new set. After 38 yrs they still stand behind their phones and they sound incredible couldn't be happier .

Pros: Company stands behind their products

Cons: heavy but built like a tank

				   Years and years of fab service				








Overall










					Bestest headphones ever. I must have had them nearly 40 years and they are as good as new! Once, one of the 'speakers' became loose so I sent them to Koss for repair - they did a full service - everything, new 'speakers', foams and cushions and at a very reasonable cost. That must have been 20 years ago!!! These are absolutely THE BEST!!!

Pros: Wonderful!

Cons: None at all.

				   Koss Pro 4AA				








Overall










					When I order these, shall be my 4th set since about 1971-72. They have traveled with me through my time in the service, been moved a number of times around the country, in boxes/trunks/car-trunks. Only problems I've had is getting the oil-filled ear-pads replaced. Other than that, they REALLY shut out most outside noise, has full/rich bass response, magnificent overall sound.

Pros: Magnificent sound, very full range, massive bass response

Cons: They do weigh a bit more than most may care for.

				   Unequalled				








Overall










					I purchased my "AA's" in '72 and use them almost daily. I have gone through several sets of pads but other than that they are still the set I go to when I want to listen to music in a busy room. Someday I should swap the 1/4" phone plug for the current 1/8" I tried the expensive noise canceling brand but these are more comfortable and just a quiet; maybe more so.

Pros: Audio quality, construction

Cons: A little heavy but weight is well distributed

				   The studio standard...				








Overall










					I used these phones from 1977 till 1987 and beyond. I assume the original owner still has them. They were used to record and mix tracks in our small studio along with some other types. These were the favorites. They isolated you from room noise and they didn't lie. For the money and considering their anvil-like construction it was a fine deal. I hope Koss still uses the same materials and methods...though not the best sounding phones on the planet they are great for laying-down tracks. Use the high-end jobs for mastering.

Pros: Rugged, good sound, neutral, good isolation

Cons: Heavy, sonically flat, can be uncomfortable...

				   Wonderful company, wonderful product!				








Overall










					I grew up with these headphones after my father bought them in the 1970's. They have been used, abused, and continued to perform flawlessly for decades! Over time the ear cups deflated, the foam headband was lost, and they began to collect dust in the basement until I heard about Koss's lifetime warranty. I sent them in 2 weeks ago, and for only the cost of shipping they cleaned them up, repaired the headband, replaced the ear cups, and installed new drivers and wire. I just got them back today, and I am blown away by the sound quality. I would highly recommend not only these headphones, but this company for their help and support, and the obvious pride they take in their products (even the decades-old ones)! I'm not sure that I will need new stereophones for a long time yet, but if I do, my next ones will be Koss.

Pros: High quality, amazing warranty/customer service

Cons: None

				   Phenomenal				








Overall










					I was very excited to use these in conjunction with my Old Sansui receiver and Yamaha CD player, and the first time I plugged in, I was shocked. Not by how good it sounded, though, rather how different it sounded. I've always had to tinker with EQ levels with other headphones (usually around Bass - 10 Treble - 8) and I immediately noticed alack of bass compared to what I was used to. But after a minute or two I realized I didn't need that because these phones play music the way the artist/producer wanted it to be heard. PRO4AA is incredibly balanced; I am very satisfied.

Pros: EXTREMELY Balanced

Cons: Weight, but doesn't really matter to me with this sound quality

				   PRO4AA				








Overall










					I have used PRO4AA for about 15 years. The warranty has replaced the phones several times because the joints that hold the band together comes apart and have so many gluings before I send in for repair. Also the insulation on the cord after several years will crack to the point of needing replacing. As a licensed broadcast engineer, now retired, I need critical headphones that seal out the sound so that I can hear audio. These headphones are excellent for critical listening and to hear problems in audio. But again they are heavy and when I have filled in doing a music shift so that college students can study for term exams, I find them a bit overwhelming after six hours of wearing. I would use these headphones in a top notch recording studio or where critical listening is important.

Pros: Good critical listening

Cons: Heavy, bulky

				   PRO4/AA				








Overall










					I am, admittedly, a KOSS collector - I have an example of every single (full-sized) model of Dynamic and Electrostatic KOSS have ever made! The 4AA is the exception - I have exactly 100 mint, boxed examples from 1974 to 2007 -Anniversary Specials - you name it. Ok, I'm a KOSS nut. I use 5 pairs in my professional studio and these all date from September 1977 - not a single fault in over a half-million hours of monitoring rock music and jazz! So good they're Spooky.

Pros: Everything; they even smell nice

Cons: zilch

					   (Posted on 9/5/2013)					


				   Review update				








Overall










					Glad to see the return of the metal frame around the earpieces. These phones are best for analog listening, though digital sound's amazing as well. You won't find a better headphone for the price, like to see the Pro 4 AAA’s remade as well. For the revival of the vinyl LP, these phones are the best companion to vinyl listening.

Pros: Solid bass,gorgeous midrange

Cons: Earpad foam could be better quaility,known to deteriorate

				   Owned since 1977 - found **NOTHING BETTER**!				








Overall










					I purchased my Pro4-AA headphones in 1977 while I was in college in TX after auditioning many other sets at numerous high-end stereo stores. Honestly, I could have spent a lot more money but nothing sounded better than these for under $200 (1977 dollars). During the short time that Koss discontinued the Pro4-AA I had at least two professional Sound Engineers try to buy my set for a lot more than I originally spent for them. Guess what... its 2013 and I still have my original set. I was ecstatic to find out that Koss will still repair them! I'm sending mine in for a rebuild and eagerly anticipating a reunion with "my old friend". 2nd generation - Just bought a pair for my 18 year old son and he is AMAZED by their sound. I absolutely (without qualification) recommend these headphones to anyone who really wants to hear everything in their music. Just remember to take them off every once in a while because they are a little heavy and slightly tight on the ears.

Pros: Great presence, low bass through high treble. Fantastic isolation!

Cons: Weight

					I bought mine in High School in 1969. They've been with me ever since. Navy usage in barracks, x-country trips, survived 2 kids. went thru 3 pair of pads. They are finally wearing out no treble on Leftside, and the headband is shot so another pair will be gotten for me for Father's day.

Pros: Survivors!!!

Cons: Heavy but you build muscles in yer neck

					SUPERIOR CONSTRUCTION, DURABLE AND BUILT TO LAST (not for the weak of heart weekend warrior) I HAVE PERSONALLY TRIED SEVERAL DIFFERENT SETS OF HEADPHONES, and BELIEVE ME - YOU, THESE "KOSS PRO4AA HEADPHONES" BEAT THE BAND, HANDS DOWN. P.S. - I'VE BEEN USING "KOSS" AUDIO PRODUCTS EVER SINCE I FOUND THEM, THE "NEWER PRODUCTS" PALE BY COMPARISON TO THE FAR SUPERIOR "KOSS" PRODUCT LINE.

Pros: PRO4AA - SUPERB LISTENING FIDELITY

Cons: NONE

				   How I sound in my Head!				








Overall










					I'm a DJ on a Morning Show. The ONLY issue I have is they weigh a ton, and with them on my head for long periods of time, they can cause discomfort. Duh, take them off. It's just a habit you have to get into....but the sound quality is worth the discomfort.

Pros: Isolation, Sound Quality

Cons: Weight

				   Koss Pro-4AA				








Overall










					I first purchased these in 1978, and am already on my 3rd pair. The Pro4AAs are incredible sounding and rival phones twice their price. The bass is tight with no muddyness and delivers the best highs you''ll ever hear. The olive green color that was fab in the 70's may not appeal to everyone, also the padding can be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours use. Don't buy into this headphone ''break in'' nonesense, these sound fantastic right out of the box.

Pros: Superb bass, incredible midrange

Cons: A bit heavy, padding could be improved

Overall










					I remember they had great low end, tremendous midrange. A very popular headphone of the 70's. The Pro 4AA headphones are equal with Sennheiser HD dries and AKG 240M headphones.

Pros: Comfort Midrange and Intelligent imaging

Cons: Bulky not a sleeping headphone!

				   Excellence personified				








Overall










					I have owned three of these headphones over the last forty years and have never found another headphone to come close to their performance. My son and grandson also swear by them (both are professional musicians). I really don't want to use any other headphones - and often prefer listening through my Koss headphones over using my Bose speaker system for music and movies.

Pros: Great isolation, accurate sound reproduction, solid bass, clear highs

Cons: weight

				   Brilliant headphones				








Overall










					I inherited this pair of Pro4AAs from my Great Grandfather who bought them back in the '70s, and they've been working well ever since. They are certainly some of the best sounding headphones that I have ever used, with full response even down to 20 Hz. I lost audio in one of the earpieces, and had to send them in to Koss for repairs, then had to send them back a second time as they broke right after I took them out of the return box. Now for every return from now on, they're asking me to pay for shipping, which isn't really a problem, considering that it's a lifetime warranty.

Pros: Audio quality, frequency range, build quality, cable length, lifetime warranty

Cons: Weight, tightness on ears, wiring

Overall










					I've owned these headphones since their early 70's. The lifetime warranty on these headphones is fantastic. I've replaced them 3 times so far. After about 10 or so years, the internal wiring will somehow come loose and I start to lose sound in one of the ear cups unless I wiggle the outside wire. The sound is so incredible and fantastic. Very accurate sounding notes.

Pros: Sound Quality

Cons: Internal wiring

				   4A & 4AA				








Overall











Pros: Good isolation, great freq. response, nice ear cushions

Cons: strain relief could do better on the long haulI have both the 4 A and 4AA both are simply a great easy to live with headset. The 4A I have had since about 1971 and the 4AA since about 1980. I have not heard any that sound that much better or are as easy to have on for extended periods. The 4A is now used with a boom mine for amateur radio and the 4AA for music.

Koss History
Koss Corporation founder John Koss shares his behind-the-scenes story of inventing the  world's first SP/3 Stereophone in 1958, and the emotional thrill of being "enclosed in the music" thanks to his innovation.

Founded 1958
World's First SP/3 Stereophone
In 1958, John C. Koss teamed up with engineer Martin Lange, Jr. to develop a portable stereo phonograph player with side-wing speakers. The pair demonstrated their new stereo record player at a Wisconsin audio show. One of the product's unique features was a privacy switch, which allowed listeners to hear music by plugging in the world's first SP/3 Stereophone. The stereophones were intended to be an accessory to demonstrate the high-fidelity stereo sound that the portable phonograph player delivered.
The revolutionary sound of the Koss SP/3 Stereophone became the hit of the show.









1958
SP/3
The World's First Koss Stereophone
In 1958, John C. Koss invented personal listening with the world’s first SP/3 Stereophone. Koss sought to replicate the excitement of a live musical performance. The original SP/3 Stereophone allowed listeners to experience sound as they had never before, bringing them closer to the music they love.

ESP/6
In 1968, Koss released the ESP/6, the world’s first self-energizing electrostatic headphone. To achieve its unprecedented sound profile, the ESP/6 employed the principle of a currentless, or electrostatic charge. The charge was applied to push-pull condenser plates, and caused movement of an ultra lightweight conductive diaphragm.




 
1969
Air Force One Outfitted With Koss Stereophones.
In 1969, passengers aboard Air Force One were treated to the Sound of Koss. The Presidential Plane’s state-of-the-art entertainment system featured Koss headphones at every seat - including the staff, press, and presidential quarters. About 50 Pro/4 units in total lined the aircraft.

In 1976, Koss introduced the Pro/4AAA. Building off the Pro/4AA’s iconic sound, the Pro/4AAA incorporated a number of new design features. The most notable of these features were the headphone’s Direct Contour Pneumalite ear cushions. The shape of the cushions mirrored an ear’s natural “D” shape. This advancement in design informed the very pronounced “D” Profile found in many Koss headphones today.

Each diaphragm moves uniformly thanks to an electron deposited proprietary semi-conductive coating.

Introduction into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame
In 1958, John C. Koss team up with engineer Martin Lange, Jr. to develop a portable stereo phonograph player with side-wing speakers. The pair demonstrated their new stereo record player at a Wisconsin audio show. One of the product's unique features was a privacy switch, which allowed listeners to hear music by plugging in the world's first Koss SP/3 Stereophone. The stereo-phones were intended to be an accessory to demonstrate the high-fidelity stereo sound that the portable phonograph player delivered.
John C. Koss Sr. is inducted into the inaugural class of the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame. At the dawn of the transistor era, John Koss St. designed a set of commercial headphones using World War II military headphones. It was 1958 and the stereo business was taking off with the advent of rock'n'roll music. The headphones were called "private listening units".
This award is in recognition of John Koss Sr. contribution and pioneering spirit that have laid the foundation of consumer electronics.

				   great sounds but needs to be more sturdy				








Overall










					i love the sound quality i get with these headphones. they can be a little uncomfortable when you try wearing them while lying down but otherwise they fit well. the biggest issue is it breaks easily. the limited lifetime warranty saves me but considering it breaks so easily, $9 each time starts to add up

				   I love these headphones but they keep falling apart				








Overall










					I love Koss and their products especially porta pro's.  I wish they would make a pair of headphones with the Porta Pro sound and  noise cancellation. (hint)  The sp 330 ear piece keeps falling off and I do not know why.  I take care of them like a baby but for some reason the ear piece becomes loose, other than that I like and would recommend them!

				   Been using them since the 1970's				








Overall










					I've been using these stereophones since the 1970's, when Mr. Koss (John, the founder) gave them to me as a gift....my dad and him were friends. I was a young teenage DJ at WOMT 1240 Radio in Manitowoc, WI. I was the envy of the staff. They all used old tinny headsets, and mine sounded great. I eventually I ended up in Dallas, and then LA, then back to WI, and the Pro4AA's have followed me around the country. They're still awesome!

					Bought my PRO4AA in the summer of 1974. Still perform perfectly, only changes have been one or two sets of ear cushions. Very few things I own have lasted over 40 years, these headphones are an enduring value!

					These are incredible with a Xonar Essence sound card  The normal built in sound card in a computer doesn't have enough power for 250 ohm Headphones But with the add in card these  Head phones ROCK Just make sure you are listening to high bit-rate music.......

				   Still the gold standard.				








Overall










					I have had a pair of these headphones for fifteen years.  They still sound better than nearly anything on the market, and won't put you back as much as some of the flashier names.  Even if you do have problems with them, the lifetime guarnetee is there to make sure you're covered. These are the only headphones I recommend for any serious work.  Accept no substitute.

				   There is nothing else				








Overall










					I first encountered the Pro4AA's when I first started working in broadcasting as the station I worked at had 12 pairs and was amazed by the accuracy and durability. At that time I was doing some of the longest weekend shifts and would have them on 12 to 14 hours at a time sometimes and and many hours in production and editing as well. The only problem they had back then was the ear cushions were oil filled and the other problem was women and hair products. The cushions would tend to harden and eventually crack because of the hair chemicals and our own natural body hair oil and sweat. Around that time Koss implemented a improvement made with a different grade of polymer to overcome that and they are no longer oil filled. Our engineering department had an open account with them for parts and we did all our own repairs and I have serviced many sets through the years for either damaged cables or cushions or user imposed damages but the drivers and frames were usually never an issue and these would get beat and worked hard every day. In the 80s I owned both a pair of double and triple A's and lost them in a relationship split, suffice to say I miss the headphones :) I still work live sound and I have used dozens of other brands but nothing even comes close to the sound and durability of the AA's and 40 years later I am looking at a set of the Titaniums. The AA's are a bit heavy but that's part of their sound and what keeps them immune to the outside sounds around you and thats what real metal feels like which is why they last. There is nothing better for accurate sound reproduction and detail and day in day out durability. I live 80 miles from where they are made and they have always stood behind every piece of the products they make. This is the definition of legendary, which is why they have stood the test of time. Make no mistake, there is nothing else......other than maybe a different model more suited for your needs but these were the catalyst of it all and all the other manufacturers worldwide have been chasing them ever since.

				   A top-grade classic!				








Overall










					I bought my first pair of Koss Pro 4 AA 'phones back in the middle '70s, while employed selling stereo gear. They were outstanding performers then and a great value for the price, and still are! No wonder the model has lasted this long! My original pair finally gave out in 2013, after A 37-year life span!

				   Best Headphones I've ever used				








Overall










					I have owned and used the Pro4A headphones since I was in the USAF in 1970. They were dutifully repaired one time under warranty and perform extremely well. Much better than other 'phones I've used it garbs the nuances of source and especially the transcribed music from my Linn Sondek turntable.					

						Review by Rick 						/

				   Design Classic (great sound but not for mobile devices)				








Overall










					I have two pairs bought approx 10 years apart which have radically different voice coil impedance. The 1974 pair have impedance of 22 ohms and the 1984 pair 220 ohms. I believe current production voice coils are 250 ohms. The 22 ohm pair are easy to drive and give acceptable SPL from iOS devices and mobile phones. The others do not and therefore require a portable headphone amplifier to give adequate SPL on mobile devices.

Regarding the Lifetime Warranty (or should that read Limited Lifetime Warranty?), I have had no response to my request to have both pairs repaired as the plastic guides for the headphone bands have both broken. It is always very disappointing when manufacturer claims are not met. I will update my review if Koss honour their lifetime warranty promise.

				   Pro 4AA				








Overall










					Understand they are 'studio' headphones, extra connection port, etc. I bought my 1st set WAY back in late 1972/early 1973. While in the service, shipped them 3X across country--they were flawless. The oil-filled pads wore out. Bought the 2nd set from Sam Goody's in NYC after 4+ years. Had NO idea about the warranty at the time. NEXT set WILL be, again, PRO4AA's!!!

Pros: BEST quality sound I've had since 1973

Cons: Weight (but I can live with it)

				   This is it!				








Overall










					To this day I won't settle for any other brand than Koss & these headphones are the reason! I bought mine around 1976 in CA but they, along with my entire music collection were stolen in 1979. Recommend, heck Yeah!!

Pros: This is the ideal, the one against all others are judged

Cons: The price (When I bought mine they were about $30)

				   Pro 4AA				








Overall










					Bought these in 1978. Used them until they were worn out at least 20yrs. had them in a cabinet for years then found out they were guaranteed for life .Sent them back to Koss and they sent me a new set. After 38 yrs they still stand behind their phones and they sound incredible couldn't be happier .

Pros: Company stands behind their products

Cons: heavy but built like a tank

				   Years and years of fab service				








Overall










					Bestest headphones ever. I must have had them nearly 40 years and they are as good as new! Once, one of the 'speakers' became loose so I sent them to Koss for repair - they did a full service - everything, new 'speakers', foams and cushions and at a very reasonable cost. That must have been 20 years ago!!! These are absolutely THE BEST!!!

Pros: Wonderful!

Cons: None at all.

				   Koss Pro 4AA				








Overall










					When I order these, shall be my 4th set since about 1971-72. They have traveled with me through my time in the service, been moved a number of times around the country, in boxes/trunks/car-trunks. Only problems I've had is getting the oil-filled ear-pads replaced. Other than that, they REALLY shut out most outside noise, has full/rich bass response, magnificent overall sound.

Pros: Magnificent sound, very full range, massive bass response

Cons: They do weigh a bit more than most may care for.

				   Unequalled				








Overall










					I purchased my "AA's" in '72 and use them almost daily. I have gone through several sets of pads but other than that they are still the set I go to when I want to listen to music in a busy room. Someday I should swap the 1/4" phone plug for the current 1/8" I tried the expensive noise canceling brand but these are more comfortable and just a quiet; maybe more so.

Pros: Audio quality, construction

Cons: A little heavy but weight is well distributed

				   The studio standard...				








Overall










					I used these phones from 1977 till 1987 and beyond. I assume the original owner still has them. They were used to record and mix tracks in our small studio along with some other types. These were the favorites. They isolated you from room noise and they didn't lie. For the money and considering their anvil-like construction it was a fine deal. I hope Koss still uses the same materials and methods...though not the best sounding phones on the planet they are great for laying-down tracks. Use the high-end jobs for mastering.

Pros: Rugged, good sound, neutral, good isolation

Cons: Heavy, sonically flat, can be uncomfortable...

				   Wonderful company, wonderful product!				








Overall










					I grew up with these headphones after my father bought them in the 1970's. They have been used, abused, and continued to perform flawlessly for decades! Over time the ear cups deflated, the foam headband was lost, and they began to collect dust in the basement until I heard about Koss's lifetime warranty. I sent them in 2 weeks ago, and for only the cost of shipping they cleaned them up, repaired the headband, replaced the ear cups, and installed new drivers and wire. I just got them back today, and I am blown away by the sound quality. I would highly recommend not only these headphones, but this company for their help and support, and the obvious pride they take in their products (even the decades-old ones)! I'm not sure that I will need new stereophones for a long time yet, but if I do, my next ones will be Koss.

Pros: High quality, amazing warranty/customer service

Cons: None

				   Phenomenal				








Overall










					I was very excited to use these in conjunction with my Old Sansui receiver and Yamaha CD player, and the first time I plugged in, I was shocked. Not by how good it sounded, though, rather how different it sounded. I've always had to tinker with EQ levels with other headphones (usually around Bass - 10 Treble - 8) and I immediately noticed alack of bass compared to what I was used to. But after a minute or two I realized I didn't need that because these phones play music the way the artist/producer wanted it to be heard. PRO4AA is incredibly balanced; I am very satisfied.

Pros: EXTREMELY Balanced

Cons: Weight, but doesn't really matter to me with this sound quality

				   PRO4AA				








Overall










					I have used PRO4AA for about 15 years. The warranty has replaced the phones several times because the joints that hold the band together comes apart and have so many gluings before I send in for repair. Also the insulation on the cord after several years will crack to the point of needing replacing. As a licensed broadcast engineer, now retired, I need critical headphones that seal out the sound so that I can hear audio. These headphones are excellent for critical listening and to hear problems in audio. But again they are heavy and when I have filled in doing a music shift so that college students can study for term exams, I find them a bit overwhelming after six hours of wearing. I would use these headphones in a top notch recording studio or where critical listening is important.

Pros: Good critical listening

Cons: Heavy, bulky

				   PRO4/AA				








Overall










					I am, admittedly, a KOSS collector - I have an example of every single (full-sized) model of Dynamic and Electrostatic KOSS have ever made! The 4AA is the exception - I have exactly 100 mint, boxed examples from 1974 to 2007 -Anniversary Specials - you name it. Ok, I'm a KOSS nut. I use 5 pairs in my professional studio and these all date from September 1977 - not a single fault in over a half-million hours of monitoring rock music and jazz! So good they're Spooky.

Pros: Everything; they even smell nice

Cons: zilch

				   Review update				








Overall










					Glad to see the return of the metal frame around the earpieces. These phones are best for analog listening, though digital sound's amazing as well. You won't find a better headphone for the price, like to see the Pro 4 AAA’s remade as well. For the revival of the vinyl LP, these phones are the best companion to vinyl listening.

Pros: Solid bass,gorgeous midrange

Cons: Earpad foam could be better quaility,known to deteriorate

				   Owned since 1977 - found **NOTHING BETTER**!				








Overall










					I purchased my Pro4-AA headphones in 1977 while I was in college in TX after auditioning many other sets at numerous high-end stereo stores. Honestly, I could have spent a lot more money but nothing sounded better than these for under $200 (1977 dollars). During the short time that Koss discontinued the Pro4-AA I had at least two professional Sound Engineers try to buy my set for a lot more than I originally spent for them. Guess what... its 2013 and I still have my original set. I was ecstatic to find out that Koss will still repair them! I'm sending mine in for a rebuild and eagerly anticipating a reunion with "my old friend". 2nd generation - Just bought a pair for my 18 year old son and he is AMAZED by their sound. I absolutely (without qualification) recommend these headphones to anyone who really wants to hear everything in their music. Just remember to take them off every once in a while because they are a little heavy and slightly tight on the ears.

Pros: Great presence, low bass through high treble. Fantastic isolation!

Cons: Weight

					I bought mine in High School in 1969. They've been with me ever since. Navy usage in barracks, x-country trips, survived 2 kids. went thru 3 pair of pads. They are finally wearing out no treble on Leftside, and the headband is shot so another pair will be gotten for me for Father's day.

Pros: Survivors!!!

Overall










					I'm a DJ on a Morning Show. The ONLY issue I have is they weigh a ton, and with them on my head for long periods of time, they can cause discomfort. Duh, take them off. It's just a habit you have to get into....but the sound quality is worth the discomfort.

Pros: Isolation, Sound Quality

Cons: Weight

				   Koss Pro-4AA				








Overall










					I first purchased these in 1978, and am already on my 3rd pair. The Pro4AAs are incredible sounding and rival phones twice their price. The bass is tight with no muddyness and delivers the best highs you''ll ever hear. The olive green color that was fab in the 70's may not appeal to everyone, also the padding can be a bit uncomfortable after a few hours use. Don't buy into this headphone ''break in'' nonesense, these sound fantastic right out of the box.

Pros: Superb bass, incredible midrange

Cons: A bit heavy, padding could be improved

Overall










					I have owned three of these headphones over the last forty years and have never found another headphone to come close to their performance. My son and grandson also swear by them (both are professional musicians). I really don't want to use any other headphones - and often prefer listening through my Koss headphones over using my Bose speaker system for music and movies.

Pros: Great isolation, accurate sound reproduction, solid bass, clear highs

Cons: weight

				   Brilliant headphones				








Overall










					I inherited this pair of Pro4AAs from my Great Grandfather who bought them back in the '70s, and they've been working well ever since. They are certainly some of the best sounding headphones that I have ever used, with full response even down to 20 Hz. I lost audio in one of the earpieces, and had to send them in to Koss for repairs, then had to send them back a second time as they broke right after I took them out of the return box. Now for every return from now on, they're asking me to pay for shipping, which isn't really a problem, considering that it's a lifetime warranty.

Pros: Audio quality, frequency range, build quality, cable length, lifetime warranty

Cons: Weight, tightness on ears, wiring

				   PRO4AA				








Overall










					I've owned these headphones since their early 70's. The lifetime warranty on these headphones is fantastic. I've replaced them 3 times so far. After about 10 or so years, the internal wiring will somehow come loose and I start to lose sound in one of the ear cups unless I wiggle the outside wire. The sound is so incredible and fantastic. Very accurate sounding notes.

Pros: Sound Quality

Cons: Internal wiring

Overall











Pros: Good isolation, great freq. response, nice ear cushions

Cons: strain relief could do better on the long haulI have both the 4 A and 4AA both are simply a great easy to live with headset. The 4A I have had since about 1971 and the 4AA since about 1980. I have not heard any that sound that much better or are as easy to have on for extended periods. The 4A is now used with a boom mine for amateur radio and the 4AA for music.

				   Comfortably and stay put!!				








Overall










					Of all the headphones I've tried for use at the gym, biking, and running, these are the ONLY pair that comfortably stay around my ears and deliver fantastic sound.  I've got particularly small ears so I've always had difficulty finding a pair that don't hurt and that don't fall off.  These are perfect, just ordered a second pair!

				   Good Sound, but...				








Overall










					This headset sounds good for a pair of earbuds/earclips. They block out external sound and allow me to hear only what I want. They fit well, but after long periods of use (over 30 minutes), I get an ache at the top of the earlobe, and have to take them off. There is no adjustment or forming.
My biggest complaint is the microphone (which is not my primary use), but I've used this head to head with a set of OEM Samsung earbuds and the microphone response is much,much better on the OEM buds. The microphone has very poor voice response, and little (if any) noise cancellation.
I was also disappointed with the lack of a volume control. There is a call answer button, but it is very difficult to press.
When push comes to shove, I would end up choosing my OEM buds over these for comfort, function, and microphone clarity. These do have the benefit of not falling out while I'm exercising, but end up being uncomfortable after a mere half hour.

				   One of the best headphones I have ever owned.				








Overall










					I was in the market for a pair of inexpensive headphones for when I'm at the gym working out or out running, so I picked these up online. They're sleek and attractive, very soft and lightweight, and so comfortable that you forget they're on. They sit well and secure on your ears that they don't move or fall out even during the most active of workouts.

I bought these expecting so-so sound that's just good enough for the gym, but I soon learned the sound quality, however, is absolutely outstanding. These headphones render the entire spectrum with incredible clarity; from deep, rumbling bass that never drowns out the sound, pronounced yet crystal clear mids, and crisp highs with no hint of distortion. I hear details in some of my favorite songs that would otherwise be drowned out and muddied by other headphones of lesser quality. The soft earpieces are made to sit just on the outside of the ear canal, and do an impressive job of sealing out ambient noise. That being said, you can enjoy the amazing sound quality of these headphones even at lower volumes.

I'm an hobbyist recording mixer, drummer, and an audiophile, and I am so impressed that I may very well buy several pairs of these for general music listening and for recording purposes. I have used many headphones over the years, including noise-cancelling Bose, reference AKGs, and studio IEMs, and quite frankly I personally find it hard to hear the difference between these and more expensive models. If you’re looking for an amazing pair of headphones at an unbeatable price, these are the ones for you.

					Customer Reviews					3 item(s)




				   Comfortably and stay put!!				








Overall










					Of all the headphones I've tried for use at the gym, biking, and running, these are the ONLY pair that comfortably stay around my ears and deliver fantastic sound.  I've got particularly small ears so I've always had difficulty finding a pair that don't hurt and that don't fall off.  These are perfect, just ordered a second pair!  					

						Review by Xtinabellina						/

				   Good Sound, but...				








Overall










					This headset sounds good for a pair of earbuds/earclips. They block out external sound and allow me to hear only what I want. They fit well, but after long periods of use (over 30 minutes), I get an ache at the top of the earlobe, and have to take them off. There is no adjustment or forming.
My biggest complaint is the microphone (which is not my primary use), but I've used this head to head with a set of OEM Samsung earbuds and the microphone response is much,much better on the OEM buds. The microphone has very poor voice response, and little (if any) noise cancellation.
I was also disappointed with the lack of a volume control. There is a call answer button, but it is very difficult to press.
When push comes to shove, I would end up choosing my OEM buds over these for comfort, function, and microphone clarity. These do have the benefit of not falling out while I'm exercising, but end up being uncomfortable after a mere half hour.

				   One of the best headphones I have ever owned.				








Overall










					I was in the market for a pair of inexpensive headphones for when I'm at the gym working out or out running, so I picked these up online. They're sleek and attractive, very soft and lightweight, and so comfortable that you forget they're on. They sit well and secure on your ears that they don't move or fall out even during the most active of workouts.

I bought these expecting so-so sound that's just good enough for the gym, but I soon learned the sound quality, however, is absolutely outstanding. These headphones render the entire spectrum with incredible clarity; from deep, rumbling bass that never drowns out the sound, pronounced yet crystal clear mids, and crisp highs with no hint of distortion. I hear details in some of my favorite songs that would otherwise be drowned out and muddied by other headphones of lesser quality. The soft earpieces are made to sit just on the outside of the ear canal, and do an impressive job of sealing out ambient noise. That being said, you can enjoy the amazing sound quality of these headphones even at lower volumes.

I'm an hobbyist recording mixer, drummer, and an audiophile, and I am so impressed that I may very well buy several pairs of these for general music listening and for recording purposes. I have used many headphones over the years, including noise-cancelling Bose, reference AKGs, and studio IEMs, and quite frankly I personally find it hard to hear the difference between these and more expensive models. If you’re looking for an amazing pair of headphones at an unbeatable price, these are the ones for you.

				   It could be better, or cheaper...!!				








Overall










					Very well made, small enough to go in a jacket pocket, excellent midrange, not so good on the highs and lows, could be the size, but a little overpriced for that reason. I'm a musician and would like to hear the cymbals from the drum set and the bass and with this price i should be able to define them..!!!

Frequently Asked Questions

How can I contact Koss Corporation? You can reach Koss Corporation's US headquarters from the US by calling 1-800-USA-KOSS, by writing: Koss Corporation 4129 N. Port Washington Ave. Milwaukee, WI 53212, or fill in our contact form and a Koss representative will get in touch with you.Where is Koss Corporation located?The Koss International Headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (4129 N. Port Washington Ave. Milwaukee, WI 53212).How long has Koss Corporation been around?Koss Corporation was founded by John C. Koss in 1953 as a television rental company. In 1958, John Koss, along with his partner Martin Lange JR., developed the world’s first stereophones, the SP/3. Today, Koss offers a complete selection of over 40 different models of stereophones, ranging from our top-of-the-line electrostatic stereophones, noise reduction systems, and infrared and radio frequency stereophones to our line of lightweight portables. Within the past several years, Koss has branched into the field of multimedia with a complete line of computer speakers, microphones, accessories, and boom microphone stereophones.What is Koss Electronics?The entity Koss Electronics no longer exists. Koss Electronics manufactured consumer electronics products such as: home theaters, DVD players, portable media players (MP3), table top stereo systems and boom boxes.
 
REPAIRS
Can I get my older Koss stereophones/speakers fixed?In most cases, if we have the parts still available, we can repair your old Koss product. Please call us at 1-800-USA-KOSS and talk to a customer service representative for part availability and pricing.
SECIALTY STEREOPHONES
What is Active Noise Reduction (ANR) Technology?Active noise reduction technology in stereophones creates an invisible shield between the listener and the droning sounds of the world by stopping low frequency noise before it reaches the ears. Tiny microphones are embedded in the stereophone ear cups. These microphones read the surrounding low frequency noise and transmit information about those undesirable sounds to a processor in a pocket sized control case. The processor, in turn, generates mirror image anti-waves that are 180 degrees out of phase and relays those anti-waves back to the stereophones. When the offending sound waves encounter the waves generated by noise reduction technology, the two counteract each other at the wearer’s ear. The offending hum and buzz is reduced and a peaceful listening environment is created where once there was only noise. Lawn mowers, jet engines, crowded environments, vacuum cleaners, computer fans or any other low frequency noise below 1000 Hz can be reduced by an average of 10dB by Koss’ Noise Reduction Stereophone the Quiet Zone 2000. Quiet Zone noise reduction is even greater for noise below 200 Hz, offering at least 15dB of protection against low frequency noise.
SPECIFICATIONS
What does frequency response mean?The range of sound reproduced by the stereophone or speaker from the lowest bass to the highest frequency. The broader the frequency response range of a product, the greater highs and lows it can reproduce.What does it mean when a product is amplified?An amplified product is one that operates on its own power supply (AC or batteries). This applies to certain computer, portable, and home speakers and stereo systems. Conversely, unamplified products must be connected to an amplified sound source in order to operate.Why is it important that a stereophone or pair of speakers be magnetically shielded?If the magnets that power a pair of stereophones or speakers were not shielded, they could cause interference, a distorted picture or even data loss when used with a TV, VCR or computer. All Koss Stereophones and Speakers are magnetically shielded.
STEREOPHONE SPEAKERS
Are Koss stereophones and computer speakers compatible with different types of computers?Yes. Koss stereophones and computer speakers will work with any computer that has a 3.5 mm headphone/speaker jack attached to its sound card or CD-ROM, regardless of whether it's a MAC or a PC.How can I order replacement ear cushions for my Stereophones?Yes, replacement earcushions are available for most models.Please select the "find replacement ear cushions" link on the left navigation bar to find your model. For pricing and availability of discontinued products, please contact our Consumer Sales department at 1-800-USA-KOSS.How is a dual volume control different from a balance control?A dual volume control incorporates volume control and balance control into one control. It allows the listener to adjust the sound level in either stereophone ear cup independently of each other. A balance control works in conjunction with a volume control to limit or increase the amount of sound that reaches a listener’s ear. A dual volume control is also a great feature for people with partial hearing loss in one or both ears.What's a dual entry cord versus a single entry cord?A dual entry cord splits into a Y with each end attaching to an ear cup. A single entry cord attaches to the stereophone at one ear cup only for greater freedom of movement.What are the advantages of a metal headband over a plastic one, or vice versa?It is mostly a matter of opinion. Each has their own benefits. A metal headband is more durable over the long run while a plastic one offers greater comfort during extended listening. The preference is a personal one.What does side-firing mean?Side-firing is a term used to describe ear-buds that go into the ear sideways, directing sound into the ear canal for improved bass response.What is the benefit of a dual volume control?A dual volume control enables the listener to adjust the volume on each stereophone cup individually. This is a great feature for those listeners who are hearing impaired in one or both ears.What is the difference between an open and a closed ear cup?An open ear cup provides a more hear-through, airy sound while a closed one delivers deeper bass response. Most commonly, a closed ear cup is paired with a closed (circumaural) vinyl or leatherette ear cushion for maximum isolation while listening and an open ear cup is paired with a foam ear cushion for greater sound transparency.What is the difference between infrared and radio frequency (RF) cordless technology?Infrared is cordless technology that operates on a beam of infrared light transmitted from a transmitter connected to the sound source to the stereophone. Listeners must remain within the line of sight from the transmitter to the stereophones or the signal is broken. A remote control for a TV operates on infrared technology. Radio frequency, on the other hand, operates on a radio signal transmitted from a transmitter connected to the sound source to the stereophone. Listeners may move freely, in any direction out of sight of the transmitter, up to a designated amount of space. Neither technology is necessarily better than the other. It is mostly a matter of personal choice. Infrared is generally less susceptible to interference than RF, while RF allows the listener to roam more freely throughout their home. When considering a cordless purchase, think about how you would use it. If you are more inclined to listen in one room only, the infrared unit offers a stronger signal with less interference. If you prefer greater freedom of movement, an RF unit will enable you to move about freely from room to room. Just as sound is subjective, so is how you choose to listen.Who uses a balance control?Anyone who has partial hearing loss in one or both ears can use a balance control to adjust the balance of sound to either stereophone ear cup, customizing how the sound reaches their ears.

				   Surprise				








Overall










					I bought them 1985 mostly for bicycling also for winter. They just do not break up after years of heavy use. I had many years of non use because could not get the replacement cushions in my country. Years went by, almost all of my music is converted to apple lossless and going for a walk with these I have say there rock and sound better with classic too than most of the modern in ear plugs. Much more comfortable than any in ear that I have tried, Koss being near. Very durable.

				   2 years Pro				








Overall










					Hi, 

I have been using them for two years now and they are exceptional now more than ever. 

I compare them to newer models from work colleagues at similar price tags (event sennheisers) and can't find anything better. 

I want to congratulate you on your professional product and will recommend them to anyone.

				   Hearing Your Music for the First Time				








Overall










					There is a reason these headphones have been around forever; Its simple, they work.
They work so well in fact that when I put them on it was like I was listening to my music for the first time, and no I wasn't listening to Madonna. I have heard things I had never noticed before, everything is so clear and balanced. I have bought numerous headphones in this price range but these are definitely the best.

				   They BANG Hardcore Rap and Headbanger Metal!!!				








Overall










					Had these for many years and they sound great! Bass good mids and crystal-clear highs!!! They BANG hardcore rap & metal, and Classical & Jazz sound nice and clean. Best hp (for the price of course) I had in many years. In my opinion they blow BEATS by Dre  out the water!!! Sound good on iPod, PC and home receiver.

					I own my first Porta sind 31 years!! Bought anno 1985, it is still working. Although, i've purchased an newer one for 3 years ago, to preserve to older one. Really a good thing to listen music without limitations. And i will never use phones with noise cancelling. Never!

					I've been using these earphones for ages. There are solid. The 60 ohms bandwidth is the key. It makes these earphones the best. You get for what you pay for.

				   Just WOW!!!				








Overall










					So I gotta say that a little research went a long way with these. Just look at the specs and you'll notice the range, the sensitivity is the norm so no special gear other than your smartphone and iDevices needed, and the Lifetime Warranty- really a lifetime warranty if shit happens to them. I am utterly pleased with these headphones for about 5years now. And if you are into the retro look I guess these work. Only con is that these bleed sound so others will hear what you are listening to, so please remember to listen within reason master blaster and to play good music lol. Enjoy!!!

				   Great sound, very comfortable				








Overall










					I have had these headphones for about four months. The Porta Pros sound great with all kinds of music. They have an "open," realistic sound which is well-balanced. They are very lightweight and comfortable, as well as extremely portable. The quality of construction seems very good, and they come with a warranty. I don't think I could be happier with these, especially considering the very reasonable price.

				   Porta Pro Headphones.				








Overall










					I have owned my pair of Porta Pro for 6 years ,just had to order the new ear pads for them which is normal for 6 years of use ,and the pads are inexpensive.  The sound after 6 years is still impeccable,and I am a bass hound and a lover of Trance & Blues ,also Classic Rock.   These headphones fulfill excellent sound in all the different music categories.  There durable and nothing has broken on them,as for them pulling a hair from time to time no big deal ,I figure by having a small piece of my hair in them proves there mine per my DNA if ever stolen,Laugh!  Long story short : I LOVE THEM!!!

				   Excellent for the price, great bass/EQ, lightweight and durable				








Overall










					I've been through them all - From some of the most expensive phones to the lesser priced and settled on the PortaPros for just about everything I do. I HATE earbuds and far prefer the response and quality from over-the-ears but they're usually too bulky. Enter the Koss PortaPro - they're the perfect balance of earbud comfort and over-the-ear performance. 

They are EQ'ed very well. No overpowering bass or compressed, over-compensation for the audio spectrum like the "B" phones (2 "B" brand names - You'll have to figure them out).

I use the PortaPros primarily as lightweight studio monitor phones as they're so comfortable and are EQ'ed so naturally.

The metal band is durable but as some others comment, it can get stuck in your hair when you remove them but to me this is part of the 'charm' of the PortaPros. Plus my hair is short, so I'm not too concerned.

Great warranty and support from Koss. All in all, the best band-for-buck headphone out there in my opinion.

					I had a 15 year old pair of porta pro's that broke. Koss replaced under their lifetime warranty. Brand new pair, same old beautifully balanced sound. 

Only suggestion is that Koss offer a version with a microphone.

				   Great sounding headphones for the price / metal headband needs to be redone				








Overall










					As everyone says, these headphones don't cease to amaze. I compare them to other brands at 3x, 4x, 10x the price and they are holding their own. They are so good that I can comfortably say they could be used to produce/write music on your laptop while you travel. You will hear all the lows, mids, and highs with these headphones. Their sonic signature is slightly mid-forward and warm in the treble section (rolls off a bit). Bass is solid and extends quite low.

BUT, the metal headband catches my hair from time-to-time and pulls a root out if I am not extremely careful! Ouch! This needs a re-work.

Koss, you have a winner with these headphones. Make a v2 of this which is still portable and compact but with a headband that is hair/scalp friendly please!

If it weren't for this gripe, I would have given it 5 stars.

				   Great for glasses-wearers				








Overall










					I end up wearing these for about 95% of my day, at home and for work. They're so lightweight that I forget that I have them around my neck. These also play nice with glasses! My glasses and the headphones never rub or clack together. 
I've had mine for half a year and listening to other small headphones now, the Porta Pro set has noticeably better sound quality. 
I firmly believe that humans will never create a more comfortable pair of headphones than these.

				   You won't believe your ears				








Overall










					Take what other reviewers have said about these headphones, believe them, and then multiply it by 100.I found them here in review http://topchoice.best/main-review/best-headphones . I received a pair of Koss UR-20s as a gift years ago and loved them so naturally I looked to Koss again when replacing my portable/on-the-go headphones. I figured they were good, especially considering that the design seems unchanged since the 1980s (which has to mean something), but I also figured that this was one of those things that was just too good to be true. However, these are bar-none the most amazing headphones I have ever put on my head. Listening to some of my favorite songs for the first time was one of those 'wow' moments where you realize you have found something that changes your expectations completely. The bar will be raised the instant you hear the bass response and incredible acoustic qualities of these light, comfortable headphones.
I don't know what I'm impressed with the most: the amazing bass, the excellent stereo division, or how loud they can get! These things are just as amazing as most of the reviews show them to be and then a lot more... I was worried about the eighties styling, but in person they don't look bad at all. I hate headphones that scream for attention, but these don't look like that when you have them on and I have already been wearing them in public (something I didn't think I would do after only seeing the picture of them online). And even if they're a bit outdated in appearance, the design is so functional you won't even give looks a second thought after you put them on.
One thing is for sure: these things have plenty of bass! Not too much (not "boomy"), but they seem properly tuned for listening to things without "bass booster" turned on, which I like. Even with the bass settings adjusted high, the bass remains clear and crisp. I'm not sure how much power these can handle without damaging them, but I listen to them very loud and they do not sound distorted or stressed at all. 
I can't say enough good things about these PortaPros! They're simply amazing. These are the first headphones (or speakers) I've had that sound absolutely awesome without adjusting the equalizer or pumping up the bass. They sound good on everything from R&B to Country and everything in-between. I've been especially impressed that they pull the bass and highs out of a song without getting that shrill, tinny treble that plagues so many headphones. If there ever was a question about the quality of Koss stereophones in my mind, these PortaPros have put it to rest and made me into a lifetime customer!

				   Koss Porta Pro				








Overall










					I had 4 pairs in about 5 years (only 1 actually broke). It doesn't matter what other headphones I own, I keep coming back for these, each and every time. I have yet to find a pair of headphone at this price range of 50$ and even more, that can give me a sound like these little ones do. I listened headphones that were priced at 200-300$ and they are still not as good as Koss Porta Pro. The more expensive headphones, yeah, they have more clarity on all ranges, but their sound isn't full enough, it doesn't have that oomph (not speaking about bass here) that Koss does. Probably the best thing about them is that, even if they have 60ohm impedance rating, they are very easy to drive. I am listening them with an old iRiver T10 (you won't believe how good this player sounds) without any kind of amp. I own their direct rival also, the Sennheiser PX100 II, but I cannot say which of them I like more. They are quite different in sound signature and they complete each other very well, so if you have the possibility, go and buy both of them as you will not regret it. Bottom line: one of the best headphones I have ever. heard

Pros: sound quality, very comfy, unique retro style

Cons: cable quality

				   Not Best in Price Range.... Simply the Best!				








Overall










					I have used $250 headphones that didn't sound as good as my Koss PortaPro headphones. They are crystal clear in the upper and mid ranges and give amazing quality of sound in the bass ranges. Headphones are not supposed to be good if you want to hear full bass. But these are. Forget the latest fadphones and get these. Unless you are wearing headphones just to show off the latest fad brand name. Then go ahead and spend your money on junk. The PortPros are the best, not just for the money, but for 5 times the money, at least.

Pros: the perfect sound in all ranges, especially bass

Cons: wire to each earphone instead of one, with connection to other within the set

				   Best sound				








Overall










					I just did a side-by-side comparison of this with the compomprable Bose headphones (SoundTrue on-ear). The Koss sound is so good it's difficult to review, because it's flawless. The Koss bass was more warm, while the Bose treble sounded chintzy and unreal.

Pros: light, small, prefect sound

Cons: disign looks funny to me

					These on-ear phones are as good as any over-the-ear phones I've ever heard. Got my first pair 30 years ago, but they got stepped-on and broken. Got these as a gift, and am once again in stereo heaven. No fatigue at all from wearing these for hours on end!

Pros: Ultra-light, wide dynamic range, excellent bass and highs!

Cons: Volume control removed from earlier version

Overall










					I've been using these since 90 when I was in the military. I bought them because of how they looked not knowing it would have the quality of sound. Every time I buy something else I always come back to these. Special!!!

Pros: light, easy to wear, compact, great bass

Cons: none

				   Beats...Dre's BEATS!				








Overall










					I have owned Porta Pros for many years. The sound quality is amazing and the clarity rivals that of a Bose product. They fold up nicely for storage in the included pouch. If anything goes wrong with them from normal use, you can return them for a warranty repair. Save your money from the big flashy headphones; these are the last set you will ever need!

Pros: Quality Durability Warranty

Cons: May be a bit tight during break in period

				   A gift that really keeps on giving				








Overall










					Received these headphones as a gift to replace old and broken Koss 35A phones. I was taken aback by their retro design but one listen to my ipod with these surprised the heck outa me. Perhaps the folks giving these knew about their reputation. I mostly use these with an ipod and my tablet, but they sound super with my stereo too. I really have no complaints as there really is nothing to complain about. Some have commented about catching in your hair, so I've fitted them for me and taped the bands with Gaffers tape. Now there is no issue and the phones are already sized for me each time I pick them up. All I can say is Thanks Koss for continuing to produce these wonderful headphones. BTW, I am a musician playing bass for 36+ years and love the bass response.

Pros: Amazing sound and comfort, durable, retro.

Cons: Pretty much none.

				   Throwback Gold				








Overall










					Koss has been producing these headphones since I have been alive and they are still the best dollar for dollar headphones in existence. These make $400 headphones sound like subsonic garbage. Buy these or you will regret it for the rest of your life.

Pros: Amazing Clarity, Unstoppable Bass, Built To Last

Cons: Not made out of platinum and diamonds

					clunky old structure, hair always get caught in the head band, the comfort zone won’t stay in a place where you slide them. but.... extraordinary sound performance. Clear and bass rich I'm so happy to have this piece of history. I bought my Porta as a gift for my friend, but after I tested the piece, I changed my mind and I’m giving him another gift instead ;) I have it along with Sony MDR-V6 , I can't use them both and I can't get rid of one neither

Pros: Great sound , unexpected bass

				   You cannot beat the price and the service!				








Overall










					The Koss Porta Pro is the best headphone at its price range, period. Clean and crisp sound across all frequencies, not to mention the charming bass. I bought my first pair in 2004 and a 25 anniversary version in 2009. The frame of the latter broke in 2009, so I kept them in storage. Not until recently did I found out that they have a limited life time warranty. I sent my 25th anniversary version back for repair and received a brand new frame within three weeks with no questions asked. Not many brands stand behind their products as Koss does, especially considering these are budget headphones comparing with many other hi-end products.

Pros: Clear sound, deep bass, solid build.

Cons: Can feel a bit tight after wearing it for a long time

				   Best in its class!!!				








Overall










					Although I have seen these headphones many years ago, I only got my 1st pair in 2011. Today, I got my 2nd pair (my 1st pair is still fully working). They are the best phones in its price class, beating the competitors that might cost 2-3 times more. My favourite Hi-Fi phones comes from another manufacturer, which costs 5 times more than the PortaPro. but the PortaPro sounds very close to it and it is my "allround" phones.

Pros: Clear sound, good bass and high frequency.

Cons: Feels a bit flimsy.

				   Just But It				








Overall










					The band was catching my hair occasionally due to the design, so I shaved my head, I really do like these, I guess!? Due to the open back / ventalated design of the speakers, everyone can here what you are listening to, its a really cool feature when you want the attention and have people to ask you "What kind of phones are those, I can here them all the way over here", just so you can show them off. Not so cool when they get attention from my Prof or the Librarian. These have a well balanced sound, almost a flat line on a Parametric EQ Test.

Pros: Servicable

Cons: Has a cord like all others.

				   5 Years and Still Great!				








Overall










					I got these 5 years ago as a christmas present and they still sound brand new even when I use them for hours and hours every week. I've used them for everything from listening to music, video games, and working on studio recordings. A simple design and really great sound. If any of my friends ask me about headsets this is always my first recommendation. For the price it's unbeatable.

Pros: Clarity

Cons: Occasional Hair is pulled

				   PortaPro is KING...				








Overall










					without doubt the best sounding earphones you'll ever hear for the price. I am a bass player and have fairly high demands when it comes to the bottom end, and it has always been the portapro I turn to when I really want to listen to a track in sweet hi-fidelity. Crystal clear highs from the 20K tops. But the real cream here for me is the bass response - down to 15K without any hint of boominess or "floppiness" - just tight, well-rounded, bass. You will find the odd track or two that might need a bottom end boost, but I can guarantee this will be the source file and not the headphones. Try not to listen to anything less than 320kbps in these beauties, otherwise you will hear the limitations of compressed file formats.

Pros: Sound, Weight, Small Form Factor

Cons: Foam Ear Covers, Cord Length

				   Heaven on the Ears				








Overall










					Once you get by the body and the simplicity of the construction, these are the best ever over the ear headphones I have ever purchased. I wore them to work out and they were a trooper, except the sweat caused the sleeve to rust and then the ear piece broke. I had them for three years and I used them constantly. When they broke I sent $9 to Koss for handling and shipping and they replaced them. They are, by far, the best sounding, and most comfortable headphones I have ever owned. If there were some way to add noise cancelling to these they would rival the expensive brands.

Pros: Lightweight-comfortable-great sound

Cons: Looks - Not Noise Cancelling

				   Small size, big sound.				








Overall










					Just got my Koss PortaPro headphones in, and I thought this has to be a joke. These are dinky. The website and youTube reviews were good, but for a moment there, when I pulled them out of the package, I thought I had made a major mistake. A plain metal ribbon headband, with small speakers, that fold up into a size not much larger than a tennis ball, and a thread like cord that looks like it would be more appropriate for ear buds than headphones. Then I listened to them. I've had more expensive headphones that didn't come close to the PortaPro. Hearing is believing. Only my 40 year old Koss Pro4AA has a broader sound spectrum, at twice the price, and much more than twice the weight. Because of the weight, I wouldn't wear the heavy Pro4AA for anywhere near as long as the PortaPro. I can see why reviews online rate these as high as other brands (nameless here) that sell for three times as much...or more. Apologies for the blurb, but I'm impressed. I'm sorry now I waited so long to try them out.

Pros: lightweight, compact size, broad spectrum sound

Cons: looks flimsy, cord looks vulnerably thin. cord is occasionally too short.

I'm really surprised with Portapro for quality and strength of design and sound quality and precision! the depth of the bass and treble detail produce a three-dimensional sound which compares reality with recorded playback! These are awesome! are also so comfortable and lighter in a few minutes you forget you have them on and allows you to listen to natural sound.

Pros: Portable, comfortable, perfect sound, beautiful design and amazing price!

Cons: None

				   Incredible				








Overall










					I got these for their portability. Initially I expected these to have tin-can sound, but it turns out to sound even better than my over-ear headphones! The mid-bass and mid-range sounded incredibly smooth and vocals feel so real. The highs are pretty good too, but the bass drowns it out a bit, but is easily remedied by using an equalizer to tone down the bass. These cans also have a large vertical soundstage. The only negative with the PortaPros is the massive sound leakage. Overall, I'll definitely buy these again!

Pros: Clear, Good Soundstage, Bassy, Portapro, Durable

Cons: Slightly warm

				   Excellent choice				








Overall










					am glad to see Koss still makes these headphones. I've had mine for 10 years or more and still love them. Excellent sound quality, light weight, minimal bulk. Koss stands behind them solidly as I did have them repaired once. All other light weight phones seems to be junk, but these Koss Porta Pro are wonderful - you can't get audio this good unless you go to full enclosure type phones.

Pros: Incredible sound quality

Cons: none

					I've typically gravitated towards headphones in the $300-$500 range in an effort to find that "perfect" sound. This is the first time I've had this much fun with my music collection. Seriously Koss... great job! :)

				   Awesome 'Phones!				








Overall










					I have been using a pair of Koss TNT/88 for 25 years and went to check on replacement pads for them. I was surprised to see the PortaPros were still being sold. I almost picked them up in 1989 but got the TNT/88 instead. After reading the reviews I figured I should try them out. Turns out the choice was correct! They are one of the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, they are lighter and smaller than they appear online. Sound quality is fantastic. Bass is awesome and not boomy, highs are crisp but not grating like on some other headphones. I have many pairs of headphones from over the ear Sennheisers, on the ear JVC's and in-ear Panasonics that I alternated depending on the music and environment, the Porta Pros have pretty much relegated them to the drawer. I love the retro look, no one around me has phones that look like mine and I think that is great!

Pros: Solid bass, comfortable

Cons: None

				   An Evergreen Model				








Overall










					There's a reason why these have been around since the 80's - performance sells. Very small footprint when folded up, very convenient to carry. A key advantage to these headphones is the fit - the metal headband acts to clamp the 'phones just right onto the ears (although there is a switch to even lesser the clamping), which gives optimal bass from such a good ear-speaker seal. At the $50 price point, they are a good value, considering their build quality and sonic performance. Also, Koss is the best with a warranty - should they become damaged they will make them good again. I've had mine for many years.

Pros: Great fit, good bass, clear mid- and treble performance.

Cons: Cushions disintegrate over time.

					I was looking for new headphones once I grew tired of my various collection of ear buds. I also have a couple headphones like Bose and AKG, I thought I was fully satisfied with these headphones but I wanted something more. I looked online and the Koss Porta Pros seemed to have good reviews so I decided to give them a go. Once I bought them and tried them on I was astonished. The fullness of the sound and the clarity of instruments was unbeatable to my standards. The Porta Pros are definitely a bang for the buck and I definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a more fulfilling listening experience.

Pros: The 80-esque design, the comfort levels, the low price and of course the amazing sound

Cons:  From time to time the headband snags my hair

				   Porta Pro has the best sound				








Overall










					I bought my first pair about 6 years ago. Since that time, there have been several headphone manufactures that have developed better sounding headphones, but only if you are willing to spend 4X more. These are by far the best sounding headphones for the cost. They have this feature where you can adjust the pressure of the earpads on your ears. While this feature is not that important to me, I can see where this would be of benefit to some. The dynamic range of these headphones are wide enough to allow the listener to hear ALL of the music. The dynamic range of the human ear is about 8Hz to 20KHz. The range of these headphones is 15Hz-25KHz, more than adequate to cover the audible wavelength and any inaudible harmonics which add richness to sounds.

Pros: Great sound for price

Cons: none

					First impression: Wow. Second Impression: Wow. These are great phones! Full-bodied bass, thorough mids, and mellow trebs. For under $50 what more could you ask for? Their lightweight design appears cheap at first, but upon listening I am completely blown away. They're easily powered by a portable MP3 player and still provide a great sense of depth and separation instead of muddy or "heady" sounds. Thanks Koss, you have one more converted believer!

Pros: Lightweight, inexpensive, powerful, retro look, depth of sound.

Cons: Retro look for some.

I foolishly stood up once while plugged into a computer and one of the cords snapped, but the warranty had it fixed within a couple weeks. Do yourself a favour and buy these headphones!

Pros: Rugged and compact design, astounding sound quality with clear highs and deep lows, comfortable, open ear design makes them ideal for running/biking.

Cons: Visually a little out of style, but you don't mess with success.

					So basically my Bose OE died on me, thinking that I am not worthy of spending expensive headphones, I bought these. I never looked back since. These are the most awesome headphones that I have ever bought. Light, great sound, great highs and low’s, even base! 2 cons, it’s leaking pretty bad. but if your seatmate does not mind, you’re good to go. The second one is the build quality isn't that +A. Plastic feels gonna snap. Best PROs.... LIFETIME WARRANTY! Enough said.

				   One of my favorites products				








Overall










					I bought my first set of Porta Pros in the late 80's. I kept them until I accidentally shredded the cable when it got caught on my leg while on the stationary bike. I was shocked to find that they were still being made. I went out and bought 2 pairs. Since then I have owned other more expensive (cooler) headphones, but none that have sounded as good or was more comfortable than my Porta Pros. I still use them in the gym 3 to 4 times per week so I tend to wear them out every 3 or so years. The great sound and comfortable design make working out way more pleasant. Thanks for maintaining such a great product for a fair price over such a long time span.

Pros: Consistancy

					I cannot go out with listening to music, and I've gone through a lot of on-ear-headphones that have superb sound quality, good build, but what has always ticked me off is how they hurt my ears after hours of having them on. I just bought these this morning and I've had them on for about 4 hours now and my ears still feel nothing. I absolutely love it! Good build quality, excellent sound, excellent feel! I am now a fan of Koss!

				   FANTASTIC sound, mechanically weaker				








Overall










					The Porta Pros acoustic quality is proverbial. For instance, anytime when somebody tries to argue with me, that you "cannot" hear "any" difference between, let's say, 160 and 320kbs mp3, I use Porta Pro to easily prove them wrong and to let them experience the real difference in sound quality by themselves. Before I voice here my concerns about mechanical sturdiness, I must say that I do abuse my gear a lot coz I mostly use it when running or travelling. My first Porta Pro I bought in early 90's. They cost me a small fortune and lasted 10+ years. Even long after all ear cushions and the supportive pads were gone, I still used them for the fantastic sound they offered, which beats any open and most of closed earphones with unimaginable ease. I was pleasantly surprised to see in early 2000s how much the price dropped. Then I was quite disappointed to see they also don’t last what they had used to. The "25th Anniversary" black edition lasted less than a year, and the replacement too. I find the firmness regulation mechanism the weakest point even with the first pair I bought in 90s. This hasn’t changed - that is still the first thing that breaks down in few weeks' time and from that moment on, the earphones are in "firm" mode. Since usually you have shorter time to listen available than the time which it takes before your ears to start hurt, I don’t find this as a big problem. What I do abhor, however, is the poor quality of cable which leads to 3.5mm jack. The 90's model lasted 10+ years. The cable was soft and had rubbery feel. The two pcs which I bought a year or two ago had a cable which had a more plastic touch and which also is stiffer. Both broke in the connection between the jack and the cable, and as a result the sound only went into one speaker. This happened only after few months of use. Of course, the earphones are very affordable but still. If you buy somewhere where the so-called "life-time warranty" is applicable, do keep the receipt. It might come handy sooner than you might expect. Also, what I m going to do w my next pair is to wrap an inch of cable above jack with black duct tape to move tear and wear from the connector part to more flexible part of the cable. Professionally I have been involved with companies who outsource their production from developed countries elsewhere. Sometimes locally sourced components do not have such good quality, or, in order to save a cent or two, a marketing decision is made to use "very slightly" lower quality parts for the not-so-critical components. I know that 1990's are gone and it will never be back. But if you ask me, I would MORE THAN happily pay 50% more and get the overall mechanical sturdiness to which I got used to 20 years ago. However, all this is "rich men's problems". Like complaining that the seats in new Ferrari are slightly less durable than the seats in the older one. It is still Ferrari! :-) If you have never listened to these earphones, try them and you will hear by yourself.

Pros: Sound (especially basses), lightweight, foldable

Cons: Regulation of firmness, jack cable

					What a throw back. I originally picked up a pair in 1990 while in the military. I thought they sounded good at that time. I had one of the first portable CD players and enjoyed listening. I really used this pair to death and I purchased another and then moved on to ear bud headphones. So I was online and found these again and said, let’s try them out again and see if I still like them. I gotta tell you, this is one of the best deals on the internet. These sound better than any ear bud and most over the ear phones. You gotta try them. If you don’t like them, then just return them. In the end you will keep them.

I was not happy with my Aviator SkullCandy's ($140) so I was looking for a new headset for X-Mas.I purchased the Koss at K-Mart of all places because they carry them in stock.

				   Mind-Blowing				








Overall










					I've had these headphones for several years now, and my brother owned them for about a year or so before he gave them to me. My family is a bit on the audiophile side, so I've had many different headphones to compare these to--notably Koss DJ100 and Sennheiser HD555. In all honesty, I may actually prefer my Koss Porta-Pros over either pair. Being someone that tries to achieve the best listening experience (on a budget, of course), I have listened to many, many headphones. These headphones have always seemed to conquer even the high-end $150+ headphones, and, needless to say, they crush every headphone in its price range. All of my friends are skeptical of them because of their classic (and kind of cheap) appearance, but their face says it all when I have them put them on. It's pretty funny watching people's reactions when they realize that $50 headphones are miles ahead of their $200 headphones in terms of sound. My only complaint is that they start to make the tops of my ears sore after wearing them for several hours on end; however, that's to be expected with most headphones. Their light weight also means they're kind of flimsy, so be careful handling them. I would go throwing them in your book bag or letting them fall onto the floor. They break very easily. However, if you care for your headphones as you should, they can easily last you an upwards of 5 - 10 years. If you're looking for headphones with high-end sound, but not the high-end price, these headphones are perfect. They sound amazing, feel great on your head, and your wallet will appreciate the price.

Pros: Incredible sound quality, Affordability, Lightweight

Cons: They tend to become uncomfortable after 2 - 3 hours of constant wear.

My kids have managed to snap one of my Porta Pros twice by mis-handling them and I have managed to damage the cord on my other set when I snagged it on a chair, but on all 3 occasions my Porta Pros were repaired under warranty within 2 days (at my local reseller here in Sydney Australia). If I ever lose these I would head straight to my Koss dealer and replace them with the same model.

					There are 3 pairs in my household. Put these headphones on and you feel as if you are right in the party or in the studio monitoring the recordings. You will hear sounds in the music that you didn't know were there. It has one of the best bass response of any headphone phone in its class, and headphones that cost $199 and $299 plus. Friends with the fashion statement headphones are always impressed with the KOSS Prota Pro when I let them have a listen. Some of them even feel ripped off. Monster will do to headphones what they did to copper cables. Remember those $100 HDMI cables, oh yeah, same crooks make beats. Keep you the good work KOSS.

Though they are delicate and can break easily if not properly handled. I would say that after owning them for 6 months, they did lose sound in one ear at one time and I had sent the back for repairs. Koss sent me a new pair super fast. And you can't beat their Lifetime Warranty on all their products with a no question ask. Really a great product and great company to do business with. Seriously.

Pros: Lightweight, compact, portable, great accurate sound.

Cons: Delicate

				   Best of the Rest				








Overall










					I bought these about three years ago from B&H back East and the price included shipping. They are better than I ever expected for the cost. I use them while working out or just relaxing. My mother (86) bought a pair at my suggestion and she loves them. She uses them to listen to music and books on tape. They are the best of the rest and save you $$$.

Pros: Great Sound - Terrific Range - Lightweight - Comfortable - Well made

Cons: Don't block out outside sounds

Overall










					I've had my pair since 1996 - that's 16 YEARS, and they still sound amazing. I've tossed them around, I've replaced the foam around the ear pads -- they dry out like any foam after 10 years, I've had my little girl yank on the cord -- and they still work flawlessly. BEST HEADPHONES I'VE EVER BOUGHT. HANDS DOWN. The only thing I can say negative is that the foam pads on the head strap (I’m sure that's not what you call it) came off after several years, but they don't really serve much of a purpose and still fit great without them. I'm sure Koss would replace them if I sent them in since they have a lifetime guarantee, too. They also are a little "old school" looking as they're open ear, but for some this is actual style points and not a negative. All in all, there is no way to understand just how rich and clear these things are until you put them on your head. I've worn $100 over the ear professional headphones that don't touch how amazing these things are. I'm constantly putting them on heads of my skeptical friends and watching their eyes light up with amazement when I hit play on my iPhone. BUY A PAIR. YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

Pros: Rich bass, comfortable, durability, lifetime guarantee

Cons: Design looks dated, foam pads on head strap fell out after several years of use

				   Perfect Headphones				








Overall










					I own one pair since five years and I still love the great sound. The only con is that the headphones come off when you do not put them in a box for transport and then you cannot tell which is the right and which is the left one. I have tested them against some 25 other headphones like Sennheiser and Monster but these are to my ears the ones with the most realistic sound. You can spend 5 times more money but don´t get better sound. Only my In-ear Shure SE535 produces even better sound but is less comfortable and cost 10 times as much. And you cannot compare closed to open headphones. Highly recommended.

Pros: Natural, distinct sound, comfortable fit.

Cons: none

				   Five Stars +				








Overall










					This headset has the best sound reproduction of any headset that I have owned, including much more expensive, full-sized ones. The frequency response is excellent up and down, but the bass fidelity is superb. Some other headsets emphasize bass response and end up with a very muddy sound, but Porta Pros reproduce the bass clearly and naturally. The fact that it is portable is just a big plus. I have taken these everywhere. I use these on my home stereo, my tablet device while watching or listening to streaming media, my portable radio, my iPod, and for in-flight entertainment instead of the cheesy headsets that the airlines sell you. In all cases, I have been 100% satisfied; it is no wonder that they have been around since 1984. If Koss ever announces that they will stop making these, I will buy half a dozen so that I will always have a pair.

Pros: excellent fidelity; portable

Cons: None

					I bought these yesterday in Berlin-great sounding, doesn’t tire the listener out...even with other genres. The Perfect buy for me. And I tested it against AKG, Beyer Dynamics, Sony etc.

Pros: Price, Comfort & Sound

				   Amazing				








Overall










					Ignore the way these look, unless you like 80s style gear that is primarily plastic. Despite the way these look, they are amazing headphones. I have some Bose on the ear phones that are blown away by these Porta Pros. The sound is comparable to phones that cost three times more. In addition to this, they are under warranty for life. So, forget about the plastic frame. Koss will stand behind it. However, it the many years I have used these, for working out, riding my bike, and just listening, I have never had a problem. Trust me. You will be amazed by the sound quality of these headphones.

Pros: Sound, Lightweight, Comfort

Cons: 80s Style

				   Quite simply the best !!				








Overall










					These headphones have to be experienced to be believed. I listen to jazz, exotica, vocalist and electronica. The first time I used these I knew my other phones were going to be second in line. I even tried them with phones costing much more...the winner every time was the PortaPros. On many Internet short lists of best headphones of all time these are there. Look for yourself. PortaPros are a classic that has not changed over the decades (thank goodness)

Pros: Full natural sound, very comfortable, collapse

Cons: My expensive headphones are gathering dust

				   Koss PortaPro				








Overall










					They produce a lot of bass (nothing major, although I do like my AKG's for the fact that they are flat and can be tweaked with the computer settings. Bass isn't so bad though. Great buy!

Pros: Very powerful, great sound quality, very comfortable (don't even notice they're on)

Overall










					I'm not an expert, but I enjoy hear music, in a variety of styles. I did not have knowledge of terms like hi end or audiophile, until try a friend's Porta Pro. The word, at that moment, that I exclaimed using those phones for the first time was "funny sound", I could experience a new level of entertainment at listening music.

Pros: Amazing sound, easy to use.

Cons: Price in Brazil

				   Definitely the best headphones under $100				








Overall










					See Pros and Cons.

Pros: Still one of the best sounding headphones after all these days. Extremely balanced-sounding with full and extended lows, warm and natural mids, detailed and smooth highs. Very well-built even though it looks flimsy.

Cons: NONE... Well, the price went up a bit in the last few years.

				   Best Headphone value out there				








Overall










					I bought a set of these at Ft. Carson back in 1990 before shipping out for Desert Storm. I was blown away by the deep base and crystal clear high's. For the next 22 years they delivered incredible sound until I accidently stepped on them and broke them the other day. There was no doubt about what I would buy to replace them. And after 22 years, they still cost the same price I paid for them back in 1990. That's amazing!! KOSS ROCKS!!

Pros: Everything

Cons: None

				   Porta Pro On-Ear				








Overall










					Excellent headphones for the price. Nice fold-up design. Produces very accurate tones. I've had mine since 2007. Still working perfectly. Unfortunately, the design and construction is pretty delicate. You just have to be careful with it. I did lose sound in on ear about 3 months after I purchased them. KOSS replaced them really quick. So far no problems. I should have purchased the other model that I think they discontinued that had a noise cancelling device attached to it or was it an amplifier with volume control. Can't remember. It too got good ratings. Anyway, extremely satisfied with these light headphones. They produce some incredible bass. Also love the life time warranty on this phone too. With the lifetime warranty options, I'm set for the rest of my life.

Pros: Sound Quality

Cons: Delicate construction

				   The Best Portable Headphones Ever				








Overall










					I have owned Koss Porta Pros for over 20 years. The sound was amazing then and I haven't heard any phones that will touch them in all around sound. The Bass is strong and TIGHT, not boomy. You can hear every instrument including voices. Every time I let a friend listen to them they are blown away. I own 5 pairs. One each for my spouse and I's MP3 player and one for the computer. I use them ALL the time so I have 2 spares in case of any breakage. I then send them back to Koss with $7 for a new or repaired set. They are very durable so that doesn't happen often.

Pros: Amazing Natural Sound through the whole sound spectrum.

Cons: None

				   Best headphones in price range				








Overall










					These on ear headphones are the best and most comfortable I've listened to for under 150$. The warm, deep and detailed tones are fantastic. The lightweight design and cushy pads don't cause any strain on my head. Listening to them is easy and recommended for long periods of time. The one thing that keeps them from being a perfect product is the thin cord is easy to tear at the jack; the cord is not very durable overall. If you have an MP3 player or listen to music through your phone these are a must have.

Pros: Very comfortable, Great sound quality, good price

Cons: Small cord easy to break

					I have been a proud owner of this headphone for over 15 years and still have the same super sound I got the first time I used it. Base, middle tone, high tone, everything super. Excellent product. Price also is ok. I can only recommend

Pros: Everything! Best sound, Comfortable, Lightweight, Quality

Cons: none

				   Super Sound, Low Price				








Overall










					I love these headphones and use them every day. Got mad when the second pair was broken, but I got a new cord from Koss themselves. THANK YOU KOSS FOR MAKING BEST HEADSETS EVER (LOVE ALL OF THEM)

Pros: Comfortable, easy to travel with, low price and good sound (the bass can go really low) and of course really good service if you call Koss. (Warranty for the rest of my life)

Cons: Had two of them and both have broken, but I got new cord on the second one.

				   The One and Only...				








Overall










					What can be said about these headphones that has not already been said in the 25+ years they have been in production? Well, my girlfriend thinks they look silly... And that for some odd reason makes me love them more. Out of few phones I currently own, I always find myself reaching for these. With the wonderful bass and full bodied sound comes the whole "Porta Pro Experience". - First you try and squeeze them out of the tiny bag that Koss has provided. - Then you unroll, unhook and unfold them. - Next comes the pain of adjusting them on your head as they rip hairs out (surprisingly gratifying). - The plug, that Tiny little plug now gets placed into whatever devise you have waiting for them. - Finally, the sound, you forget just how wonderful it is almost every time as it hits your ears. Heaven. Thank you Koss for this gem.

Pros: Comfort (Once On), Warm Sound

Cons: Hair Ripping, Short Cord

				   Sound, battery life, comfort all great!				








Overall










					My 9th pair of Koss headphones (since my first set of Pro 4's in the late 70's) and very pleased with the sound, controls, battery life, and ease of paring. Have different styles for different purposes and environments and this latest addition was a result of wanting to cut the cord while travelling and/or walking / biking. Setup worked flawlessly, battery life is excellent and the sound, while not equal to my studio models is better than expected. Love the onboard controls too! Bluetooth range and connection stability / quality are also excellent. Another great product from the folks who invented the stereo phone!

				   Great for the price point				








Overall










					Well, first I would like to say that these are a great pair of headphones for the price. I tend to listen to a lot of game and movie soundtracks as well as some European metal music, and I'm noticing sounds with these that I didn't hear at all with my Logitech gaming headset (I forgot the model) or my Koss UR22i headset. For only $200, I'm loving the sound quality that these deliver.

PROS: Great sound quality, well balanced lows mids and highs, comfortable on my head and ears (for the most part, see CONS below), seems to be a sturdy design, cord fits in tightly and doesn't move around in the connector

CONS: The ear pads make me sweat and then they get sticky, cord could have been longer

FINAL THOUGHTS: For the most part, I love them. I just wish they would have made the ear pads out of something that didn't fit quite so snugly so I wouldn't sweat against them. The cord could have been longer... However, no matter whether I have them wired or connected via Bluetooth, they sound amazing for the price. I highly recommend these to anybody else looking for a great pair of high quality budget headphones.

				   Excellent Sound, Excellent Battery, Smart Design				








Overall










					I have owned these headphones pretty much since they launched late last year. Although the cost may seem a bit hefty, the value of these headphones are worth far more than the retail value. Firstly, these are the only Bluetooth stereo headphones I've found that can last more than 8 hours on a single charge. To make matters better, is they are extremely lightweight. I'm almost certain that it's not possible for a battery to exist in the device, but sure enough it works. Also, charging through a standard 2.1 amp 5 volt charger takes about 1 hour. Also, the sound is absolutely amazing. If you own, or heard, a pair of ProDJ100, or ProDJ200 (of which I own both) then you'll know what these sound like. Pretty much identical to clean, crisp, sound they provide. Another plus, since it has it's own power source through Bluetooth, no need to carry around an amp for your mobile device. They are plenty loud! I also fell in love with the design of the device. No only is it just as comfortable as the ProDJ200, the buttons for the Bluetooth controls are placed very well. They're easy to find, and the added textures to them make it easy to identify as well. Also, the idea to have a line in for the headphones is great too. It will always work, even when the battery is dead! Now the Bluetooth is excellent, but it does have its quirks. Interference is common when moving around in these. I go through a lot of public transportation, and I've gotten used to the few hiccups every now and then. However, minor interruptions are exactly that; minor. Bluetooth always reconnects seamlessly and the music keeps on playing. NFC is a nice touch for devices that support it. Great way to connect and disconnect your Bluetooth without have to change any settings. Also, if you have a device with the aptx codec, get them. Quality loss on these while playing lossless FLAC is near to none. I don't hear any distortion when I use a supported device. And if there is some distortion, it probably isn't audible to begin with. The regular Bluetooth compression isn't very bad either. MP3s being the most unaffected due to the bandwidth being similar. However, the convenience of having the Bluetooth feature outweighs the negatives. Mainly because call clarity is excellent. Not only can the person on the other end hear me well, I can hear them with no problems at all. Now, if you're looking to see what version of bluetooth these use, my best guess would be 4.0. However, there isn't a great way to test that. So it's pretty much on Koss to give that information. For obvious reasons, these also have a 1 year warranty. It sucks, but it's understandable. Bluetooth technology changes periodically and batteries don't last forever. Depending on the type of battery used in these, these headphones can probably have a life of 5-10 years before the battery becomes useless. Now if only they designed the line in to be on the left ear cup, and not on the right. All in all, these are probably the best headphones to get on the Bluetooth market within this price range. They're solidly built, and definitely worth having.

Pros: Battery Life, Sound, Design

Cons: Bluetooth Interference, Warranty

Earbuds & In-Ear Headphones
If you prefer a style of headphone that is more compact in size, Koss earbuds and in-ear headphones are perfect choices. The size of Koss' earbuds and in-ears don't take away from the advanced technology: they feature noise-isolating capabilities that give acoustic reproduction found in high-end closed-style headphones. Compatible with your iPhone, Koss' featured earbuds, the KEB25i, include an in-line microphone and button that allow you to access your phone's functions. With your choice of color and design, you can still have stylish, high-performing sound with Koss earbuds.

 









The Original American Stereophone Company
Ever since I invented the world's first SP/3 Stereophone back in 1958, Koss Stereophones have been bringing back the excitement of a live performance. Music lovers around the world recognize that dedication to accuracy in sound reproduction as The Sound of Koss.John C. Koss, Founder
