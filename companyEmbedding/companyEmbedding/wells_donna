In fact, in many cases, Wells engineers apply the latest technologies to address known design issues associated with some OE products.In short, by choosing Wells, you’re doing more than fixing a problem; you’re often preventing other, unforeseen issues down the road.Learn more about why Wells Vehicle Electronics is the right choice.Featured Category BulletinsDifferent products highlighted monthly, providing information regarding the function of the product, repair tips, product improvements, features and benefits of purchasing the Wells brand of automotive electronic needs.Learn more about Featured Category ProductsIgnitionCoils, Coil-on-Plug Coils, Ignition Control Modules, Distributor Caps & Rotors, Pick-up CoilsLearn more about Wells Ignition Products.Fuel SystemsFuel Pressure Regulators, Fuel Injectors, Carburetor Repair KitsLearn more about Wells Fuel System Products.EmissionsEGR Valves, Idle Air Control Valves, Throttle Air Bypass Valves, EGR Vacuum Solenoids, PCV ValvesLearn more about Wells Emission Products.SwitchesCombination & Multi-Function, Headlight, Ignition Starting, Stoplight, Oil Pressure Sending Unit, Cruise Control, Power Door Lock, Turn SignalLearn more about Wells Switches.SensorsThrottle Position Sensors, Camshaft Position Sensors, Crankshaft Position Sensors, Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensors, Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensors, Knock Sensors, Oxygen Sensors, ABS Wheel Speed SensorsLearn more about Wells Sensors.Starting/ChargingSolenoids, Regulators, Diodes, Rectifiers, Starter DrivesLearn more about Wells Starting/Charging Products.RelaysAC Blower Relays, Battery Relays, ECM Relays, Fuel Pump Relays, Idle Speed Control Relays, Power Seat Relays, Turn Signal Relays, Starter Relays, Blower Motor RelaysLearn more about Wells Relays.Tire Pressure Monitoring SystemLearn more about Wells Tire Pressure Monitoring System
