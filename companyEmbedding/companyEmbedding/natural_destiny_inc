This prospectus relates to shares of our Common Stock that may be offered and
sold from time to time by the selling stockholders named herein. There will be
no proceeds to us from the sale of shares of Common Stock in this offering.


The food and beverage industry is extremely competitive. The principal areas of
competition include pricing, packaging, development of new products and flavors,
and marketing campaigns. The products we sell will be competing directly with a
wide range of food and drinks produced by a relatively large number of
manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad, well-established
national recognition for years, through well-funded ad and other marketing
campaigns. In addition, companies manufacturing these products generally have
far greater financial, marketing, and distribution resources than we have.

Important factors that will affect our ability to compete successfully include
the continued public perception of the benefits of the products, taste and
flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, the development of new,
unique and cutting edge products, attractive and unique packaging, branded
product advertising, pricing, and the success of our distribution network.

We will be competing to secure retail outlets who will agree to sell our
products over those of our competitors. The extremely competitive pressures
could result in our products never even being introduced beyond what they can
market locally themselves.

The product we will be focusing on promoting is cherry plum drink which will
compete generally with all liquid refreshments, including similar cherry plum
based beverages. We will compete directly with Shandong Qianbo Biological
Technology Co., Ltd., a company engaged in the production and sale of cherry
plum based products, including juice blend, enzyme, wine and health supplements.


Company Description
Natural Destiny Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 21, 2015
as a holding company. Through our subsidiaries in China, we are engaged in the
business of distributing foods and beverages in China. Our executive offices are
located in Jiande City, Zhejiang Province, China. 

We do


 not grow, produce or manufacture any products. Instead, we act as a
distributor for our products primarily based on client or market demands. Our
principal distributed products include fruits, juices, wine and nutritional
supplement products such as tablets and condensed drinks made out of traditional
Chinese herbs such as ginseng and edible bird’s nest. At the present time, our
principal supplier and principal customer are controlled by a related party, Mr.
Jianrong Xia, our sole officer and director. Over time, we hope to expand to
work with other suppliers and service other customers.

For our current fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, we are focusing our
resources on the marketing and sale of the XinshuiTM cherry plum drink and other
cherry plum based products including cherry plum wine. The XinshuiTM cherry plum
drink is a concentrated drink that contains mainly cherry plum extract,
supplemented by a variety of natural foods and herbs and is a natural anti-aging
drink.

Due to the health benefits of cherry plum, our current consumers for the cherry
plum based products will be primarily mid-aged and elderly people. We plan to
market and sell the cherry plum based products initially through our
distribution channels and network in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces.

Our executive office is located at Room 902, Unit 1, Pearl Business Building,
Jiande City, Zhejiang Province, PRC. Our telephone number is +86 571-64197788
