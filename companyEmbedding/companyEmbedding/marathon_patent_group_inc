ACT NOW. PATENTS MATTER. | Save the Inventor

Save the Inventor


 



 


 
 






Act Now. Patents Matter.

What’s The Problem?
The movement to overhaul the patent system is nominally aimed at stopping abusive litigation, but the architects of sweeping legislative changes to patent law haven’t considered all the risks. Any efforts to address problems with patent litigation should be narrowly crafted to target only abusers and not inventors. There are far fewer abusers of the system than legitimate inventors whose innovation promotes job creation and economic growth.

          ACT NOW. PATENTS MATTER.        









Why Does This Matter?
For more than 200 years, our patent system has fueled America as a leader in innovation. We need to protect inventors, universities, innovators, start-ups, research institutions, incubators and small businesses whose incentive to keep innovating would disappear if they can’t prevent large companies or foreign competitors from stealing their ideas. Inventions are often the results of years of hard work and expensive research and development. Inventors rely on strong patents to protect their ideas and their livelihood.
Weakening our patent system will…Undermine job creation in the U.S.
Weaken our competitive edge in the global marketplace
Reduce investor confidence – thus weakening our economy

Who Does This Affect?
We need to protect inventors, universities, innovators, start-ups, research institutions, incubators and small businesses who often find themselves infringed on by large companies.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

A



Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Save the Inventor


 



 


 
 






Act Now. Patents Matter.

What’s The Problem?
The movement to overhaul the patent system is nominally aimed at stopping abusive litigation, but the architects of sweeping legislative changes to patent law haven’t considered all the risks. Any efforts to address problems with patent litigation should be narrowly crafted to target only abusers and not inventors. There are far fewer abusers of the system than legitimate inventors whose innovation promotes job creation and economic growth.

          ACT NOW. PATENTS MATTER.        









Why Does This Matter?
For more than 200 years, our patent system has fueled America as a leader in innovation. We need to protect inventors, universities, innovators, start-ups, research institutions, incubators and small businesses whose incentive to keep innovating would disappear if they can’t prevent large companies or foreign competitors from stealing their ideas. Inventions are often the results of years of hard work and expensive research and development. Inventors rely on strong patents to protect their ideas and their livelihood.
Weakening our patent system will…Undermine job creation in the U.S.
Weaken our competitive edge in the global marketplace
Reduce investor confidence – thus weakening our economy

Who Does This Affect?
We need to protect inventors, universities, innovators, start-ups, research institutions, incubators and small businesses who often find themselves infringed on by large companies.
