As you can see from our portfolio, we??™ve produced a tremendous amount of copy-intensive magalogs and direct mail packages (24, 48, even 80 pages long). Our clients tend to be super-successful entrepreneurs who sell products for between $2,500 and $10,000.
We all are firm believers in the Big Idea. As a result, we??™ve specialized in niches that require a lot of thought and tend to be idea-driven ??” including financial services, investments, health, personal development, travel and Internet marketing services.

What Clients Say:“Robert Henderson brings game changing ideas to the table and opportunities to work with him always result in my walking away with some brand new strategy or technique that I hadn’t thought of before.” – Amy Long, Senior Vice President, InvestorPlace Media
“More than half of the viewers who watched Robert’s Video Sales Letter bought our $995 product. With just a small list, we brought in a tremendous amount of money. I highly recommend Robert for any investment related product launch or promotion.” – Lee Campbell, Senior Vice President, Investors Alley
“Robert Henderson is one of our most reliable 'go to' copywriters and marketing strategists. He and his team consistently provide top-quality sales promotions, video scripts and email marketing campaigns on time and on budget.”  – Wayne Ellis, Eagle Financial Publications
“We hired Robert Henderson’s financial marketing company and couldn’t be happier with the results he’s given us. His first promotion for us resulted in a 43% increase in revenue/sent and a 30% increase in response over our most successful promo (for one particular product) this year.” -- Shannon Slattery, Schaeffer’s Options
“We came to Robert Henderson to help us increase sales in a hurry – and that is what he did. His talented team took tired, old promotions for products that weren’t selling very well and, in a matter of weeks, gave us sizzling direct mail packages that increased sales 225% over the results we were getting before.” – William Hudlow, Hampshire Labs

Publisher's Description▼▲
Begin Your Supernatural Journey into the Courts of Heaven  What does it mean to make your case in the "courts of Heaven?"  In recent years, God has raised up Robert Henderson as a prophetic voice, calling Christians to pursue breakthrough by using the courts of Heaven prayer blueprint.   God is more willing to answer our prayers than we will ever know! The problem is that we face a legalistic accuser and adversarythe devilwho wants to prevent these prayers from coming to pass. Your victory against him is not fought on a battlefield; its won in the courtroom.  When your prayers are answered, Gods purposes are fulfilled on the Earth.   In this all-new message, Henderson gives you practical keys that will enable you to boldly access the courts of Heaven and state your prayer cases with confidence.    You will:Understand the three dimensions of prayerDiscover the 3 keys to unlocking your breakthrough in the courts of HeavenLearn the 6 prophetic declarations that Jesus blood makes on your behalfCancel the devils accusations by releasing the supernatural power of your testimonyLearn how to access the courts of Heaven, make your case, and watch as prayers are answered, miracles are released, and long awaited breakthroughs come to fruition!

Product DescriptionWhy do some people pray in agreement with God s will, heart and timing, yet the desired answers do not come? Why would God not respond when we pray from the earnestness of our hearts? What is the problem, or better yet, what is the solution?Robert Henderson believes the answer is found in where your prayer actually takes place. We must direct our prayer towards the Courts of Heaven and not only the battlefield. Robert shows that it is in the courtrooms of Heaven where our breakthroughs can be found. When you learn to operate there you will see your answers unlocked and released.This book will teach you the legal processes of Heaven and how to operate in its courts. When you get off the battlefield and into the courtroom you can grant God the legal clearance to fulfill His passion and answer your prayers."More Product InformationPublisher: Robert Henderson Ministries
