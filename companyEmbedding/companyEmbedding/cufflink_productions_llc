Kickboxing Classes In Chelsea
by Jolyn L. July 27



I brought a Groupon to give the class a  try, 10 classes and a pair of free gloves and 1 training session - what do I have to loss.

Place is clean, smells good (no stinky feet).  Staff is friendly and helpful.  I didn't feel judged or out of place.  Other members are also friendly; which helps during partner work.

Not to mention the music and vibe, I find myself singing and dancing.  I highly recommend
