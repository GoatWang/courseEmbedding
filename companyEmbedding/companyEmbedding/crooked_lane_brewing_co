About Us — Crooked Lane Brewing Company



























































About Us

What is the Crooked Lane philosophy and why "local" is important







About Crooked Lane Brewing Company
PhilosophyOurs is a philosophy of community; of sharing and supporting one another; of families and neighbors joining together. Because we’re stronger, more inspired, and just plain happier when we’re together. Though our community consists of neighborhood friends for now, we’re ramping it up—applying its core principles to Crooked Lane Brewing Company. And we’re saving a stool for you.Our neighborhood farming efforts illustrate the Crooked Lane community ideology in practice. In winter, each household lays claim to a crop, and by summer we share our harvests. Spent grains from the brewing process then feed the community’s egg-producing chickens, or the poultry raised for meat. This approach to farming increases our production, and allows us to specialize while vastly diversifying our fresh produce. More importantly, it brings us together, culminating in backyard tasting gatherings where we enjoy the harvest while exploring brews, new and old.  The essence of Crooked Lane is being there for each other, and making things happen. We gather to share laughs and life. To expand that philosophy, we open our tavern and invite you into our community.







 LocalCrooked Lane Brewing Company believes in "local," and we execute this principle in a number of ways. Wherever possible, we buy from within our community, and plan to tap well-loved nearby restaurants to complement our beer with their cuisine at the tavern. Our Mandarin IPA fruit comes from Colwell Thundering Herd Ranch in Penryn and we procure our honey for our Honey Wheat Beer from Miller Honey Farms in Newcastle. Once they’re available, we’ll prioritize locally grown hops. In fact, we’re in conversation with area farmers planning to grow hops in the region. By supporting nearby businesses, we’re also able to produce beers that represent our region all the more.  Crooked Lane so values the “local” principle that you’ll find it comes up in every conversation we have. So let’s move on....







LocationYou’ll see local flair in our venue, as well. Though built only in 1982, it’s something of a local landmark, having, over the years, served as a movie theater, a car dealership, and, more recently, a martial arts center. The torso-shaped punching bags are now long gone, and taproom/brewery conversion is underway. We’re setting up an inviting outdoor seating space where showroom cars once gleamed on patio display, and in place of theater seating, you’ll find our 15-bbl stainless steel brew house cooking up your favorite beers. This you can enjoy out in the community beer garden on the building’s north side. High visibility, easy access, and distinctive architecture make our building stand out.We’re designing spaces that offer variety to suit your mood on any given day. Relax outside on the covered patio, meet up with friends in the community beer garden, or join us indoors in a setting flanked by sunset-facing windows on one side, and, on the other, the massive stainless steel vats brewing your beer. Inside we’ll offer traditional table seating, couches and coffee tables, or seats at the bar, which will, of course, be crooked.







The stainless equipment is now on order and under construction, folks. We’re calming the building’s five massive entryway columns with climbing fig and movable stone planters. It’s all coming together, and Crooked Lane is shooting to have its distinctive taproom and brewery ready for you in Q2 2016. Until then, keep checking back. We’ll keep you posted on its progress.

Maybe this is what would've happened if the lead character in "Breaking Bad" focused on something a little more, um, legal.
Two of an upcoming Auburn brewery's founders, Kirt Braun and Adrian Psuty, are scientists who work for a biotechnology company. Braun has a background in molecular and cellular biology. Psuty has a background in chemistry.

Then, there's the third founder: Paul Schilling, the "marketing dude" who acknowledges the way science has influenced brewing. "It's everywhere, from the cleanliness of the process to following it to the letter," he said.




If you think the founders' background stories are interesting, wait until you hear about the space Crooked Lane Brewing Co. will occupy. Located at 536 Grass Valley Highway, it's expected to open in the first half of 2016.
It fills a prominent building that has housed a movie theater, a car dealership and even a martial-arts dojo. The site has been empty for about two years, Schilling said. The brewery's operators will keep the columns located at what's currently the building's front entrance. They'll add greenery to the exterior. Fans can follow the brewery's progress on its Facebook page.
Don't expect a cramped tasting room. The building covers about 5,000 square feet, plus a 1,200-square-foot patio. In addition, the brewery's founders plan to have a beer garden with at least 2,500 square feet of space. They expect the taproom will host trivia nights and include TVs. The beer garden will feature special events with live music. There are no immediate plans to serve food at Crooked Lane, but the brewery will use food trucks.




 


"It's going to be very family-focused," Schilling said. Creating a sense of community is a priority for the brewery's founders. That includes using locally grown ingredients, such as fruit and honey, that are consistent with a farm-to-fork philosophy.
The founders will begin by offering at least six taps, a number they say will eventually increase substantially. Schilling said the beer selection will offer "an infusion of traditional European styles" with a lower alcohol percentage than you might expect. The brewery will also offer non-alcoholic craft root beer.

Standard beer talk is fine. But if you want to take things up a notch, the scientists are game.
Braun, the brewery president with a background in biology, will talk to you about yeast strains. Psuty, the head of brewing operations with a background in chemistry, will discuss the way a beer's water profile impacts its quality and taste.
Confused? Fortunately, the story behind the brewery's name isn't as technical. Two of the founders live on Crooked Lane in Newcastle.
There might not be a scientific formula to surviving in the increasingly crowded craft beer scene, but they're ready to take a chance. A lone trophy remains in the space from its martial arts days. The founders are thinking about incorporating it into the brewery as a piece of "building lore."
Or, better yet, a subtle suggestion that the venture will be a knockout.
