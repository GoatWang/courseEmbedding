FAQ





 

FAQclocktower2017-04-07T18:53:48+00:00 


How would you describe your typical client and their needs?
Our Vision statement says:
We are an independent investment boutique providing advice that is appreciated and trusted by experienced investors in the Pacific Northwest.
Reviews of our relationships reveal that;

Most clients either live in the Pacific Northwest or have ties here. We serve clients in various locations throughout the US such as Vermont, New Jersey, Phoenix and Palm Springs to name a few.
We are trusted and capable enough to be the primary or sole advisor for the vast majority of our clients.
We have two major groups clients

The larger group either already utilizes their portfolios to support their lifestyles or are close to that phase.
The smaller group is in various phases of the accumulation process where “retirement” is 5-20 years down the road.


The age profile of those utilizing their portfolios to support their lifestyle tends to be over 55. We tend to attract the “experienced” investor and not to work with the “35 year old retiree.”

Our client’s needs often include:

A high level of trust, collaboration and service.
A strategy and comfort level that they will not run out of money.
A desire to minimize taxes.
The planning for legacy issues.

We typically serve clients who have $2 to $10 million of investable assets and a total net worth from $3 to $15 million.  We are willing to establish relationships with those who have less investable assets if we can create value and all parties are committed to growing the relationship.  We often work with multiple generations of the same family.
I am concerned about running out of money.  How can we address this?
We believe the best approach is to have a realistic assessment of your current financial condition, a handle on your living expenses and then create a sustainable strategy.
Future expected returns may not provide a cushion for poor planning and execution.  Therefore, it is imperative to establish both realistic expectations and a sound strategy from the beginning.
The “How We Work” tab above discusses how we work with you to develop this strategy.
I do not like paying more taxes than I have to.  How can we address this?
We are sensitive to the fact that taxes are often the single largest expense in maintaining your lifestyle.  Therefore, we are thoughtful when it comes to the ways we can minimize your tax burden.
We collaborate with you, your Certified Public Accountant, Trustee and business partners as needed.
We plan with you and your other advisors regarding asset sales, IRA distributions, gifting, etc.  Simple steps can help minimize your tax liability.
We are careful about correctly holding your assets.  If you have both retirement and taxable accounts, where a particular investment or asset class is held has a material tax difference.  The tax ramifications are very different between family partnerships, trusts and retirement plans.
I currently get my advice from a big bank/brokerage.   How are you different?
Our high service model is different because our typical relationship is much larger than what is typical at a bank or brokerage firm.  Our desire for long term, in depth relationships allows us to have different incentives and focus than most firms.
Mike, Rich and David take the lead in working with you to manage and coordinate your financial affairs.  They have over 25 years of business experience and complementary skill sets.  We are geared solely to meet the significant needs of our clients that a typical bank or brokerage client simply doesn’t need.
We believe our client focus and this comprehensive, high touch, long term approach is different from other choices you have.
I have significant real estate holdings.  Can you help me here?
Yes.  Mike has an extensive real estate background.  Many portfolios include real estate investments made by, or coordinate by, Mike.
Mike can apply his experience and knowledge to your holdings.  The work could be done on a project or hourly basis.  The type of work could include;

Analyzing an offer you have for a current holding,
Helping you work through financing or refinancing options,
Working with you to get a property ready to be put on the market soon or in the medium term,
Calculating your current ROI, opportunity cost, etc., to determine if a current holding is worth retaining.

Throughout the process the focus is on maximizing the value of your real estate holding while building a lasting relationship.
What type of returns can I expect in the future?
Future returns are likely to be modest with many portfolios returning 6% to 7% in an environment where inflation is 2.5%.  We wrote a monthly newsletter on this topic in March 2012.  To read it, Click Here.
This has significant implications for planning and execution purposes.  No longer can one expect to retire, spend and experience a material real return increase in the value of their portfolio.  More likely, whatever lifestyle you can afford when you stop working for money, is the lifestyle you should become accustomed to.  Improving upon the initial staring point in a low return environment is either not realistic or would require more risk than most can absorb.
Your thinking should be that future returns can help you maintain a lifestyle, but will not allow you to make up for poor planning or irresponsible spending.
One final point is that staring points make a huge difference.  Some retire at the end of a multi-year bull markets.  Past returns were above trend.  However, they extrapolate those returns into the future when the most likely case is for lower future returns simply because of the past bull market.
Can you help me with my taxes and estate planning?
No and Yes.  We are not accountants, financial planners or attorneys.  However, we have deep backgrounds in these areas and we do know and work with professionals in these areas who we trust.
We can collaborate and coordinate any process with these professionals.  We do this at least on a yearly basis with many accountants.  We can do this on an ad hoc or regular basis with your attorney.
Our goal, as with other services we provide clients, is to provide you, the client, with a comprehensive approach to your unique situation and a collaborative process is how we can help you get great advice in areas that are outside our core competencies.
Do you offer insurance products?
We do not offer insurance products.  However, as with taxes and estate planning issues, we do know insurance professionals who can help you.
We avoid the conflicts of interest that are common with insurance products due to their often high commission compensation.
Where do you custody assets and how safe are they?
Private Asset does not take custody of your exchange traded securities such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. We custody these assets at Charles Schwab. You can always “get at” these assets. The third party custodian provides you with statements so you can verify account balances and activity.
We do custody a limited amount of assets due to Michael Thayer’s affiliation with PAM Real Estate Group, PAM Real Estate Group II LLC and single purpose real estate LLC’s.
How do you charge for your services?
The objective of our pricing structure is to be fair and to create value.
Most clients are charged on a percentage of asset bases.  This varies by asset size and type of asset.  We strongly urge clients to utilize us for more than asset management so they do not view the fee or relationship as only an asset management fee or relationship.
Some portfolios are charged a fixed fee.  A percentage of assets fee is implied.  These accounts usually have liquidity, tax or other constraints that limit the account’s strategy and, therefore, the potential to add value for the client.  Again, our objective is to be fair.
Hourly work is done when appropriate.  This usually entails work on client assets not under our direct supervision like personal real estate holdings.
We are happy to discuss our alternatives with you.Call for an appointment now and experience the difference.Contact us today!Contact us today!

Client Centered Approach
 Our Investment Process
 Personalized Service

 

Explore Private Asset Management at  T. Rowe Price


 Each portfolio should have an investment program tailor-made to fit the objectives of the individual
			investor, based on requirements for safety of principal, spendable income, or capital growth.
— Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.



T.  Rowe Price offers an approach to investment management that has been consistently applied over generations. 
			Whatever your objective—building and	preserving wealth, growing your income, creating a legacy, or meeting your 
			philanthropic target—the Private Asset Management Group brings investment management expertise and world-class 
			service to help you achieve your goals.






Focusing on our Client's Objectives is Our Foremost Priority



Our portfolio management process begins with you, the client. Through personal meetings and consultations, we 
					gain a full understanding of your investment objectives, return needs, risk tolerance, time horizon, liquidity 
					needs, tax considerations, and other critical factors that define your investment guidelines.

With a  clear mutual understanding of your investment objectives and guidelines, we will implement an asset 
					allocation strategy tailored to meet your goals. Our next step is to carefully construct a well-diversified portfolio 
					of securities that combines multiple asset classes and investment styles.





Our Process is Grounded in Comprehensive Research



 If you want to have an understanding of any business, 
						it is important to know the background of the people who started it and directed its past, and the hopes and 
						ambitions of those who are planning its future.
— Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.




T. Rowe Price emphasizes proprietary, fundamental research as the cornerstone of  our investment process. We offer 
					broad investment expertise in a wide array of U.S. and global equities and fixed income securities.

Our equity analysts conduct intensive research including meetings with company managements. These meetings can 
					take a variety of forms, including on-site visits, face-to-face discussions, attendance at industry and investment 
					conferences, as well as hosting companies in our offices. Security selection is driven by fundamental analysis to 
					identify companies that are expected to generate strong long-term returns.



Our fixed income analysts apply rigorous independent credit analysis for both tax-exempt and taxable securities. 
					We believe that superior long-term fixed income performance can be achieved by managing portfolio risk through fundamental 
					research and analysis, active duration management, and sector allocation management.

In today's global economy, we believe it is imperative to understand industry and company fundamentals from a worldwide 
					perspective. Research is conducted in our investment offices in Baltimore, as well as our offices in London, Hong Kong, 
					Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo.





We are Committed to Delivering Personalized Service



 A philosophy, a distinct point of view, and a deep 
						respect for the individual client's needs and wishes.
— Thomas Rowe Price, Jr.




T. Rowe Price believes that our clients are our most important asset. We work closely with our clients and provide 
					direct access to a dedicated portfolio manager who is responsible for actively managing the portfolio's assets.

We also work closely with our client's advisers, including legal and accounting professionals, family offices, 
					and investment consultants, to design investment portfolios that integrate with each client's overall financial strategy.



Finally, we believe in the importance of ongoing, detailed communications with our clients. We conduct regular face-to-face 
					meetings to measure progress toward goals or to adjust investment guidelines relative to changing needs. Clients receive 
					quarterly investment summaries, performance data, and investment letters.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

TORONTO, Jul 21, 2017 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- Changes made across its mutual funds and private pools to enhance investor offering, including new suite of lower-cost passive portfolios  CIBC (CM)

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    CM, -0.56%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         -- To improve value and accessibility for Canadian investors, CIBC Asset Management Inc. (CAM) is introducing a suite of new, lower-cost CIBC Passive Portfolios. CAM is also making changes to its investment lineup that include management fee reductions, lower investment minimums and a simplified product offering across its mutual funds lineup.  "Canadians are looking for value and choice when it comes to investment solutions, which is why we made a number of enhancements to our product lineup to improve cost and accessibility," says David Scandiffio, President and CEO, CIBC Asset Management. "The changes announced today are driven by our clients' changing needs."  CIBC Passive Portfolios  As part of its commitment to offer diversified solutions to Canadian investors, CAM is launching CIBC Passive Portfolios on July 31, 2017. This new suite of portfolios is competitively priced and has been designed to meet a range of investor risk profiles. These portfolios will be available to regular and fee-based investment accounts, and to self-directed investors with accounts at CIBC Investor's Edge, a division of CIBC Investor Services Inc.  Management fee reductions  To provide additional value to Canadian investors, CAM is implementing management fee reductions of up to 40 basis points (bps) on 18 funds across its mutual fund and private pool lineup effective September 1, 2017. These changes follow management fee reductions implemented in September 2016.  In addition, CAM will waive a portion of its management fee or absorb certain expenses, or both, on an additional 48 funds (ranging from 5--40 bps) beginning September 1, 2017. The decision to continue to waive management fees or absorb operating expenses is at the discretion of CAM.  Lower initial investment minimums  CAM is reducing the minimum initial investment on certain investment solutions.   -- The Renaissance Private Investment Program (RPIP) will have a new minimum requirement of $100,000, lowered from $150,000. -- Families with at least $250,000, previously $500,000, in one or more Renaissance Private Pools will be exempted from the minimum requirement of $100,000 per pool. -- The minimum initial investment for Axiom Portfolios will be reduced significantly from $25,000 to $500. There are eight Axiom Portfolios, and each managed solution provides diversification by asset class, geographical region, investment style and market capitalization.  The full details of the management fee reductions, and the minimum investment and RPIP changes effective September 1, 2017, can be found here.  Termination of several mutual fund classes  To simplify its product offer, CAM is terminating several mutual fund classes with relatively small asset size and a limited number of unitholders.   -- Effective end of business day today, classes designated for termination will be closed to new purchases, including purchases through regular investment plans. These classes will subsequently be terminated on or about October 13, 2017. -- All investors of the terminating classes will be sent a written notice of the termination at least 60 days prior to October 13, 2017. -- Investors have the right to redeem or switch out of an affected mutual fund class up to the close of business prior to the effective date of termination and will not be required to pay any redemption fees, sales charges or other fees associated with the class termination.  CAM is also capping several mutual fund classes, which will be closed to new purchases, including through regular investment plans, effective September 1, 2017.  The full details of all mutual fund classes to be terminated and capped can be found here.

Our Latest Thinking











Identifying the main drivers of long-term change is key to investment success in the 21st century. We believe we are at the beginning of a secular growth phase for the U.S. economy driven largely by the rebalancing of global growth from the developed to the developing world. We focus on the long-term drivers, the macro forces and investment themes at play across industries that are taking us into the next growth cycle.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.

                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        BuyerZone.com, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 7 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
