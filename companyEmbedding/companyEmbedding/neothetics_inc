			LIPO-202 is a proprietary, first-in-class injectable formulation of the well-known long-acting ß2-adrenergic receptor agonist, salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved inhaled products such as SEREVENT DISKUS®, ADVAIR HFA® and ADVAIR DISKUS®. Our studies suggest that salmeterol xinafoate activates ß2 -adrenergic receptors on fat cells, triggering the body’s natural process of metabolizing stored triglycerides (fat) resulting in a reduction in size and volume of the fat cells in the treatment area without damage of nearby tissues. LIPO-202 has an extremely favorable safety profile, with little to no adverse post treatment effects.  LIPO-202 is currently being evaluated for the reduction of submental fat commonly referred to as a double-chin.

Neothetics stock plummets 66% on news of negative results for fat-reduction drug
Neothetics Inc.  shares dropped 66% in premarket trade Monday on news of negative results for its fat-reduction drug. The drug, LIPO-202-CL-31, is intended to reduce fat beneath the chin that is due to belly fat. But in a phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, the drug "did not demonstrate improvement on any efficacy measurements or separation from placebo," the company said, calling the results "unambiguous." Neothetics is considering "the path forward for the company," and will share next steps "shortly," said Kim Kamdar, a member of Neothetics' operating committee and board of directors. Neothetics shares have surged 65.7% to $2.32 over the last three months, compared with a 4% rise in the S&P 500 .

About Us


Pipeline
» LIPO-202


Investors


Contact






			LIPO-202 is a proprietary, first-in-class injectable formulation of the well-known long-acting ß2-adrenergic receptor agonist, salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved inhaled products such as SEREVENT DISKUS®, ADVAIR HFA® and ADVAIR DISKUS®. Our studies suggest that salmeterol xinafoate activates ß2 -adrenergic receptors on fat cells, triggering the body’s natural process of metabolizing stored triglycerides (fat) resulting in a reduction in size and volume of the fat cells in the treatment area without damage of nearby tissues. LIPO-202 has an extremely favorable safety profile, with little to no adverse post treatment effects.  LIPO-202 is currently being evaluated for the reduction of submental fat commonly referred to as a double-chin.

					Full Description



Neothetics, Inc., incorporated on February 1, 2007, is a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company develops therapeutics. The Company focuses on localized fat reduction and body contouring. It focuses on the development of LIPO-202 for the reduction of central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat in non-obese patients. The Company has completed Phase II development of LIPO-202. LIPO-202 is administered in a subcutaneous injection procedure that activates a natural metabolic process to shrink fat cells, without killing them, resulting in localized fat reduction, measurable results within four weeks and minimal risk with no downtime. The Company is also developing another product candidate, LIPO-102, an injectable form of a combination of salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate. LIPO-102 is indicated for the treatment of the orphan indication of symptomatic exophthalmos, or protrusion of the eye from the orbit, associated with thyroid-related eye disease caused by the expansion of fat and muscle behind the eye.LIPO-202The LIPO-202 is an injectable formulation of the long-acting Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist receptor agonist and salmeterol xinafoate, which is an active ingredient of FDA-approved inhaled products such as SEREVENT DISKUS, ADVAIR HFA and ADVAIR DISKUS. LIPO-202 can be administered by a physician or clinician in approximately five minutes in a specified number and defined placement of subcutaneous injections across the abdominal treatment area through a 30-gauge needle. Administering LIPO-202 evenly across the abdomen shrinks fat cells reduces central abdominal bulging due to subcutaneous fat. The Company completed a 513-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase II dose-ranging clinical trial, known as the RESET study, of LIPO-202. LIPO-102-CL-01 study is a single and multiple-dose Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics study. LIPO-102-CL-03 study provides information on the safety and efficacy of a range of doses of LIPO-102 administered through subcutaneous injection once or twice per week for four weeks to non-obese patients with measureable abdominal bulging. The Company focuses on LIPO-102-CL-04 and LIPO-102-CL-09 studies.The VAL-CL-13 study is an exploratory study that compares magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with external three-dimensional (3-D) digital stereophotogrammetry and a laser-guided manual tape measure procedure as objective physical measures of abdominal circumference. VAL-CL-24 study is a non-drug study, which includes approximately 40 subjects and explores two dimensional (2-D) ultrasound as a tool to measure subcutaneous fat thickness in the anterior abdomen, and determines the intra- and inter-rater reliability and retest reliability of 2-D ultrasound at its investigative clinical sites.LIPO-102The Company's product candidate, LIPO-102, is indicated for the treatment of the orphan indication of symptomatic exophthalmos, or protrusion of the eye from the orbit, associated with thyroid-related eye disease caused by the expansion of fat and muscle behind the eye. The Company's preclinical studies demonstrate that the injection of salmeterol xinafoate into the back fat of minipigs reduces subcutaneous fat thickness as determined by 2-D ultrasound.The Company competes with ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc., Erchonia Corporation, SculpSure, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc., Cutera, Inc. and Allergan plc.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
