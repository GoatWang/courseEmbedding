City - North Las Vegas








North Las Vegas






Considerably quieter than Las Vegas proper, North Las Vegas is a large, mostly suburban community that serves as home base for many of the region’s professionals. With Nellis Air Force Base right next door, North Las Vegas is the hometown for numerous armed service members and civilian military employees.  Las Vegas Motor Speedway regularly hosts NASCAR and other auto races on the east side of town.

Craig Ranch Regional Park at the center of town is a popular spot for folks to stretch their legs and enjoy the scenic views of the city, with the mountains and The Strip on the horizon; it’s also home to a gigantic skate park and a major community sports complex. For weekend excursions into the rugged natural surroundings, Red Rock Canyon is under thirty minutes away and Lake Mead can be reached in about an hour.

Renters Insurance


Renters Insurance: Why Every Resident Needs It
If disaster strikes, you want to ensure your valuables are protected and your personal liability is insured. For that reason, all residents of our market-rate communities are required to have renters insurance with a $100,000 minimum liability policy. If the contents of your apartment are damaged, renters insurance will help recover the cost of your loss.
 
You may purchase renters insurance from any insurance company you choose.  For your benefit and convenience, Echelon Property Group has partnered with ePremium, a national provider of renters insurance. To take advantage of special rates on renters insurance follow the enrollment instructions below:
 
• Visit www.epremiuminsurance.com and enter the zip code of your apartment community
 
• Select your community from the list, select the effective date and coverage amounts to receive your quote
 
• Review the policy and pricing and follow the easy prompts to bind coverage
 
• Monthly or Annual Payment Plans are offered
 
• Pay by credit card or echeck
 
• To purchase by phone, call ePremium Customer Service Center toll-free at 1.800.319.1390 (Monday – Friday from 6 am to 6 pm MST and Saturday from 7 am to 2 pm MST).
 
Before you move in, you will need to provide proof of renters insurance, including liability. Please note if proof of insurance isn't provided to the community staff or your insurance policy lapses during your lease, you will be enrolled on a Forced Placed Renter's Insurance Policy through ePremium and will be charge the appropriate fees in accordance with your lease agreement.

Apartments for rent in Pennsylvania
Rent an apartment in Pennsylvania and see why the state's motto is "Virtue, Liberty and Independence". Pennsylvania has some of our nation's richest history. But it is also has some of the most modern, forward-thinking cities in the nation. 

How would you like to rent a Pennsylvania apartment in Philadelphia? The city of Philadelphia is positioning itself to become one of the "greenest" cities in the nation. Led by the mayor, the Greenworks Philadelphia project has set lofty goals and put a detailed plan into action that aims to lower city government energy consumption, increase the use of alternative energy sources, lower greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs in green industries, among many other things. There is a combined effort on the part of the city government, local businesses and even the residents to make Philadelphia a greener city and continue to improve its livability.

If you crave the outdoors, Pennsylvania is a great place to rent an apartment. The Allegheny Mountains in the Laurel Highland region have become recognized as a vacation destination, particularly by western Pennsylvania locals and people from the Mid-Atlantic States. Outdoor recreation choices include white-water rafting, lift-served mountain biking, and snow skiing. Of course, The Pocono Mountains is famous for its resorts, natural scenic beauty, 150 lakes, and the quaint, historical towns in the four county area. Pennsylvania has much to offer to the adventurous at heart. 
Consider Pennsylvania apartments in Easton's downtown area if you want to live in a pedestrian-friendly, historic district. Stroll through downtown's historic Centre Square, which was where one of only three readings of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776 took place. From July through October, you can purchase fresh produce and other local goods at the Easton Farmer's Market, which has been held in the Centre Square since 1752. You can also feed your appetite at a local cafe and then browse unique shops and antique stores.

City - North Las Vegas








North Las Vegas






Considerably quieter than Las Vegas proper, North Las Vegas is a large, mostly suburban community that serves as home base for many of the region’s professionals. With Nellis Air Force Base right next door, North Las Vegas is the hometown for numerous armed service members and civilian military employees.  Las Vegas Motor Speedway regularly hosts NASCAR and other auto races on the east side of town.

Craig Ranch Regional Park at the center of town is a popular spot for folks to stretch their legs and enjoy the scenic views of the city, with the mountains and The Strip on the horizon; it’s also home to a gigantic skate park and a major community sports complex. For weekend excursions into the rugged natural surroundings, Red Rock Canyon is under thirty minutes away and Lake Mead can be reached in about an hour.
