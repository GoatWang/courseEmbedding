Nationwide Homeowners Insurance in Whitehall, Pennsylvania From William Huck Agency Inc





                        Protect your house and personal property by choosing the right insurance coverage from
                        Nationwide.

Homeowners insurance is a crucial part of owning and protecting a home. That’s why the William Huck Agency Inc has worked so diligently to understand the insurance priorities of 18052-6618 homeowners and their residential properties. In fact, the exact location of your home may mean your home’s risk profile is slightly different from that of your Whitehall neighbors' right down the street. No matter the specifics, Nationwide has coverage that’s right for your Whitehall home, and our agents can help further personalize your homeowner’s policy.  How so? Beyond the location, the property itself often has very different kinds of assets that can be protected through home insurance coverage. The structure and dwelling coverage are the backbone of most policies, but William Huck Agency Inc offers plenty of additional coverage options through Nationwide. These options cover things like a detached garage or other buildings, contents and valuables, or even a number of exclusive coverage programs like Better Roof Replacement®. Plus, if the time ever comes when one or more of our homeowners need to return a home to its former glory, the Nationwide On Your Side® Claims Service offers extra peace of mind.   Our office is located at 779 3rd St, Whitehall, Pennsylvania, 18052-6618. But our home insurance expertise extends throughout the greater Whitehall area. Call the William Huck Agency Inc at (610) 266-2996 to get our take on the best way to protect against potential homeowner damages.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                                Report abuseTranscript of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. By: William Colon, Blake Reyes, Enoch Johnson, Ben M.A theme in the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is racism and slavery. Though the book was written after the end of the civil war the southern states in America was still struggling with racism and the effects of slavery. By the early 1800s there was a plan to put the United States back together and integrate the freed slaves into society. This plan was called Reconstruction. Although at the time it was not working but it hadn’t failed outright. Mark Twain set the novel a couple of decades in the past when slavery was still a common fact of life. In huckleberry Finn Twain exposes the hypocrisy of slavery. He demonstrates how racism affects the oppressors as much as it affects those who are oppressed. ThemeAnother theme of Huckleberry Finn is the hypocrisy of a “civilized” society. When Huck plans to head west at the end of the story he says he is leaving to avoid further “sivilizing”.  During the story Twain expresses the society around Huck as a collection of degraded rules and concepts that defy logical thinking. The non-logical type of thinking comes into the story when the judge allows Pap’s “rights” to his own son. But yet at the same time to me this is just another way of having a system that puts a white man’s rights to his property or his slaves. Literary AnalysisPlotThroughout the twentieth century, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has become famous not only as one of Twain's greatest achievements, but also as a highly controversial piece of literature. In certain Southern states, the novel was banned due to its extensive criticism of the hypocrisy of slavery. Others have argued that the novel is racist due to the many appearances of the word "nigger." Unfortunately, the connotations of this word tend to override the novel's deeper antislavery themes, and prevent readers from understanding Twain's true perspective. In Twain's time, this word was used often and did not carry as powerful a racist connotation as it does currently. Therefore, in using the word, Twain was simply projecting a realistic portrayal of Southern society. Undoubtedly, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is highly significant due to its deep exploration of issues surrounding racism and morality, and continues to provide controversy and debate to this day, evidencing the continued relevance of these concepts.Background of the BookMark TwainThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnQuotationsThe Widow Douglas she took me for her sonand allowed she would civilize me but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when Icouldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again,and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyerhe hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I join if I would go back to the widow. So I went back.I hadn't had a bite to eat since yesterday, soJim he got out some corn-doggers and buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens-there ain't nothing in the world so good when it's cooked right - and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time....We said there warn't no home like a raft, after all.Other places do seem so cramped up and smoothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.It was a close place. I took... up [theletter written from Watson] , and heldit in my hand. I was trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knew it. Istudied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself "All right then, I'll go to hell" - and tore it up. It was awful words, but theywas said. And I let them stay said and never thought no more about reforming.Quotation #3Quotation #2Quotation #1Born in 11/30/1835, Florida Missouri 6 of 7 kidsAge 4, moved to Hannibal,MissouriAge 12, father died of pneumoniaJobs: Printer apprentice, editorial assistant, training as a riverboat pilot, assisted brother (territorial secretary of Nevada), silver/gold miner, reporter, writer, lecturerMark Twain means "two fathoms deep" a river termWife: Olivia Langdon Married: 1870Children: 4 girls (Susy, Clara, Jean) and 1 boy ( Langdon)The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, 1876The adventures of Huckleberry Finn, 1884Death: April 21, 1910Geography and Life on the River-1800 Collision of various people and cultures Native Americans and early white settlers created the norms for the region 1820 Mississippi River valley was sold as part of the Louisiana PurchaseLand exhaustion in east forced people west and miss river valley seemed like a good place to settleCrowded caused a forceful removal of Native Americans from the land1850Lower Mississippi: slave country, wealth and powerNorthern Mississippi: no slave country, opportunity, respectabilityConfederates controlled the Mississippi river between 1816-1863 Many slaves crossed river by way of underground railroadThe first bridge built across the Mississippi River was in 1855The first railroad bridge finished in 1856Another theme of Huckleberry Finn is the hypocrisy of a “civilized” society. When Huck plans to head west at the end of the story he says he is leaving to avoid further “sivilizing”.  During the story Twain expresses the society around Huck as a collection of degraded rules and concepts that defy logical thinking. The non-logical type of thinking comes into the story when the judge allows Pap’s “rights” to his own son. But yet at the same time to me this is just another way of having a system that puts a white man’s rights to his property or his slaves. Example# 2There are also symbols throughout the story. To me the biggest symbol in the story was the Mississippi River. For Huck and Jim the Mississippi River is a symbol of freedom. They don’t have to answer to anyone while they are on their raft floating on the river. And for both Huck and Jim freedom is something different. For Jim freedom is going towards the free states, and for Huck freedom is getting away from his abusive father and the “sivilizing” of his town. But further on in the story the river becomes more and more dangerous as they run into evils and even the influences of towns on the banks of the river. Although the river offers a refuge from trouble it also is leading from one bad situation to another. And with each of their escapes they continue on a continual drift southward, towards the Deep South and entrenched slavery. As Huck and Jim continue down the river thee once thought paradise and source of freedom turns into a short term means of escape that continuously takes them further towards danger. Full title -  The Adventures of Huckleberry FinnAuthor - Mark Twain (pseudonym for Samuel Clemens)type of work · Novel genre - Picaresque novel (episodic, colorful story often in the form of a quest or journey); satire of popular adventure and romance novels; bildungsroman (novel of education or moral development)Publisher - Charles L. Webster & Co.Narrator - Huckleberry Finn's Point of view  · Huck’s point of view, although Twain occasionally indulges in digressions in which he shows off his own ironic wittone  · Frequently ironic or mocking, particularly concerning adventure novels and romances; also contemplative, as Huck seeks to decipher the world around him; sometimes boyish and exuberanttense · Immediate past setting (time) - Before the Civil War; roughly 1835–1845; Twain said the novel was set forty to fifty years before the time of its publicationSetting (place)  - The Mississippi River town of St. Petersburg, Missouri; various locations along the river through ArkansasProtagonist  - Huck FinnMajor conflict - At the beginning of the novel, Huck struggles against society and its attempts to civilize him, represented by the Widow Douglas, Miss Watson, and other adults. Later, this conflict gains greater focus in Huck’s dealings with Jim, as Huck must decide whether toturn Jim in, as society demands, or to protect and help his friend instead.rising action · Miss Watson and the Widow Douglas attempt to civilize Huck until Pap reappears in town, demands Huck’s money, and kidnaps Huck. Huck escapes society by faking his own death and retreating to Jackson’s Island, where he meets Jim and sets out on the river with him. Huck gradually begins to question the rules society has taught him, as when, in order to protect Jim, he lies and makes up a story to scare off some men searching for escaped slaves. Although Huck and Jim live a relatively peaceful life on the raft, they are ultimately unable to escape the evils and hypocrisies of the outside world. The most notable representatives of these outside evils are the con men the duke and the dauphin, who engage in a series of increasingly serious scams that culminate in their sale of Jim, who ends up at the Phelps farm.ContinuationSamuel Clemens, also known as Mark Twain, was born in Florida, Missouri, in 1835. He moved to Hannibal, Missouri when he was four. At age 11, the young Clemens went to work to help support his family when his father died. He began working as a printer's apprentice for his brother Orion at 13. Later on as a young man, he worked as a printer in multiple towns and cities which includes New York, Philadelphia, and St. Lois. Samuel wrote and published funny stories and tall tales about life in America for years. It was about 1857, on a trip to Mississippi, when he abandoned his writing to pursue a lifelong dream. After 18 months, he earned his pilot's license to become a riverboat pilot. Clemens spent about four years steaming up and down Mississippi. During the Civil War, Twain spent a few weeks in the Confederate army befor resigning and heading to Nevada, where his brother Orion had been appointed territorial secretary. While in Nevada, Clemens started writing again. This is when he adopted the pen name "Mark Twain." A term used in river navigation, "mark twain" means water that is two fathoms (or about 12 feet) deep.Twain used experiences in the first three decades of his life for ideas for the stories he would later write. An example of this is a famous Civil War incident which Twain later recounted Roughing It. In 1864, a Nevada man named Reul Gridley received a 50- pound sack of flour as a payment for a wager. He decided to auction it off with the proceeds going to the newly- formed United States Sanitary Commission. The winner put the flour for auction again and so did the next winner. The sack traveled from town to town changing hands over and over but remained on the auction block as Gridley raised $150,000 for wounded Union soldiers and sailors.In 1865, Twain earned national attention when he published "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County". His best-selling book, " Innocents Abroad" was published in 1869. This story is about a trip Twain took to Europe and the Middle East.Twain married a woman named Olivia Langdon in 1870. He wrote the novels "Roughing It" (1872)," Tom Sawyer" (1876), and "Huckleberry Finn" (1864) in their home in Hartford, Connecticut. The books sold well but he struggled financially. He invested much of his earning in worthless inventions. In desperate need of cash, Twain teamed up with Ulysses S. Grant. Grant, which was the ex-president and Civil War hero, was interested in publishing his memoirs. Twain proposed a deal to Grant to let him publish his memoirs. Like Twain, Grant had financial issues so he agreed.In 1885, Grants Memoirs was published shortly after Grant's death. Grant's royalties went to his widow Julia. Twain continued to struggle after the project so his co-owned company Webster & Company went backrupt. He was forced to write lectures to pay off his debts. Finally, his debts was all paid off. Unfortunately the deaths of his wife and two daughters contributed to the deep sadness that Twain experienced in his later years. He died in Redding, Connecticut, in 1910, with his autobiography unfinished.Full transcriptMore presentations by

Product Description▼▲
Huckleberry Finn, rebel against school and church, casual inheritor of gold treasure, rafter of the Mississippi, and savior of Jim the runaway slave, is the archetypal American maverick.  Fleeing the respectable society that wants to "sivilize" him, Huck Finn shoves off with Jim on a rhapsodic raft journey down the Mississippi River. The two bind themselves to one another, becoming intimate friends and agreeing "there warn't no home like a raft, after all. Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don't. You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft."  As Huck learns about love, responsibility, and morality, the trip becomes a metaphoric voyage through his own soul, culminating in the glorious moment when he decides to "go to hell" rather than return Jim to slavery. Unabridged. 10 hours. 8 CDs. Read by William Dufris.

Publisher's Weekly▼▲
Considered the first great American novel, part of Finns charm is the wisdom and sobering social criticism deftly lurking amongst the seemingly innocent observations of the uneducated Huck and the even-less-educated escaped slave, Jim. William Dufriss voice, unpretentious and disarming, like the books main characters, seems the perfect armature on which to hang this literary strategy. Although he does an expert job with the entire cast, Dufriss delivery of Jims dialogue is his crowning achievement. Out of context, Dufriss Jim might sound mocking and racist, due to his expert delivery of Twains regional vernacular. Ignorance and intelligence, however, are not mutually exclusive, and taken as a whole, Jims mind and heart come shining through, allowing the listener to reflect on their own assumptions. Tantor Media includes the entire text as a digital e-book on the final CD, a wise and thoughtful move in a market with swift and changing currents. (Mar.)Copyright 2008 Reed Business Information.
