He was a Kid at Heart and made us laugh our asses off with some of the Pranks he pulled on us! I still remember when he took Billy's Cigarettes and filled the Pack up with water and stuck them back in his Jacket. As we were all chuckling at the Bus Stop, he was standing in the Dining Room Window Laughing his ass off that brought him to tears!
I'm sure that by this time he and your Mom are having one laugh after another as he catches her up on the Latest Pranks, Memories, Grand Children and News.
