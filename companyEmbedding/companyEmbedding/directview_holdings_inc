    DirectView Holdings, Inc    Share Structure  Outstanding Shares: 4,988,971 Million as of May 22, 2017   https://DirectView.com/   Acquired 2 Companies 4/27/17:  http://www.apexcctv.com/   http://vs-us.com/      DirectView Completes Acquisition of Two Privately Held Texas-Based Security and Surveillance Companies with Combined Fiscal 2016 Revenue of Approximately $5.3 Million   Company assumes full legal ownership of Video Surveillance, LLC and ApexCCTV, LLC   NEW YORK, NY -- April 27, 2017 -- InvestorsHub NewsWire --  DirectView Holdings, Inc. (DIRV) ("DirectView" or the "Company"), a company focused on ownership and management of leading video and security technology companies, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Video Surveillance, LLC and ApexCCTV, LLC (the "Acquisition Companies"), two Texas-based video security and surveillance companies operated and solely owned by Mark D. Harris. Based on the unaudited financial statements for fiscal 2016 the combined revenue of the Acquisition Companies is approximately $5.3 million.   Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement (the"SPA"), Directview acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each of the Acquisition Companies for a minimum of approximately $1.9 million in cash to be paid approximately six months from the date of acquisition. Upon the successful completion of a two year audit of the Acquisition Companies, in accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting standards for the fiscal years ended 2016 and 2015, DirectView will be obligated to pay an additional amount ranging from $2,000 up to $500,000 based on the positive average annual cash flow achieved in those two years. DirectView has received a non-binding term sheet to finance the payments as well as to fuel future growth of the combined companies. The Company also intends to explore a number of potential financing sources to achieve the best long term results for the Company and its shareholders. For a more detailed description of the SPA, please review our current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2017.   As part of the transaction, Mark D. Harris has entered into a three year employment agreement with DirectView where he will serve as President of the Acquisition Companies. Mr. Harris is a technology services veteran with over 25 years experience and a proven track record of building profitable revenue growth. He served for 19 years at Intervoice (formerly traded as NASDAQ: INTV), a world leader in delivering natural, intuitive ways for people to interact, transact, and communicate through technology. As Senior Vice President of Americas Operations and Global Services at Intervoice, he led a team which was responsible for pioneering the execution of a new Enterprise Hosted Solutions business to support advanced self service applications and intelligent transactions. Beginning in 2008, upon the acquisition of Intervoice by Convergys Corporation (NYSE: CVG), he served as Senior Vice President of Global Technology Services at Convergys Corporation through 2014. He brings a wealth of experience in M&A integration, business development and strategic planning to the Directview management team.   Roger Ralston, CEO and Chairman of DirectView, stated, "The acquisition of these companies is a very exciting transformational event for DirectvVew as we position for current and future growth. Mr. Harris has built two businesses that in less than three years, are generating substantial revenue and, more importantly, positive cash flow. He also has a wealth of technology management experience that will be invaluable for DirectView as we execute our strategic growth plan. With his expertise in establishing a nationwide market presence through direct and online sales and our ability to tailor customized solutions in the marketplace, I believe we have set the stage to achieve significant organic sales growth in the coming years. Additionally, this acquisition gives us the critical mass to opportunistically roll-up other security and surveillance companies in order to further accelerate the growth of our business and build significant long term value for our shareholders."   Mark D. Harris added, I am excited to now be a part of the DirectView team as we work to become a force in our industry by creating a very attractive roll-up platform. Through this combination, all of our companies will benefit from increased bandwidth, greater expertise and more wide ranging sales opportunities.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Premium - The only way to fully access the Zacks Rank


The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
