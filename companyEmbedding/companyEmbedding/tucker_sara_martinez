Early life[edit]
A native of Laredo, Texas, Tucker received her undergraduate degree in journalism, graduating with honors from the University of Texas at Austin (UT). She was a general-assignments reporter for the San Antonio Express before returning to UT, where she received a master of business administration degree with high honors.
AT&T[edit]
Before joining HSF in 1997, Tucker spent 16 years at AT&T, becoming the first Latina to reach the company’s executive level. In her last assignment at the company, she served as a regional vice president for AT&T’s Global Business Communications Systems, where she led a $400 million division to its highest profit levels.[5] Prior to this, Tucker was vice president for Consumer Operations, a $370 million operation with 6,500 employees serving AT&T’s 80 million consumers. Under her leadership, this group contributed to the division’s receipt of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
Hispanic Scholarship Fund[edit]
Prior to joining the Department, Tucker worked for nine years as the CEO and president of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she aimed to double the rate of Hispanics earning college degrees. In her time at the helm of HSF, Tucker raised $280 million for scholarships, growing annual scholarships from $3 million to over $25 million, and launched community outreach programs to raise college expectations in Latino families and communities.[6] She also increased the organization’s annual budget from $3.5 million to more than $40 million, raised a landmark $50 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc,[7] and stewarded the Hispanic portion of the $1 billion Gates Millennium Scholars Program.[8]
U.S. Under Secretary of Education[edit]
Tucker was nominated for the position of U.S. Under Secretary of Education by President George W. Bush on September 5, 2006,[9] and was confirmed by the Senate on December 9, 2006. As Under Secretary, she oversaw all policies, programs and activities related to postsecondary education, vocational and adult education, and federal student aid.
During her tenure, she developed and implemented two programs to increase access to college: a joint initiative with the U.S. Treasury Department to make nearly $70 billion in 2008-09 federal student loans available during the nation’s financial crisis, an effort described by the Wall Street Journal as “one bright spot in a season of crises and bailouts,”[10] and the website, college.gov (now StudentAide.gov), which helps students and families prepare for college.
In addition to the oversight of over $32 billion in disbursed appropriations and almost 5,600 discretionary awards, Tucker provided expert testimony before Congressional committees and special hearings, led policy discussions within the Administration and with trade associations, and led or represented the United States in international delegations.
The National Math and Science Initiative[edit]
In 2013, Tucker was elected as the Chief Executive Officer of The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI),[11] a Dallas-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the improvement of student performance in the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
Recognition and philanthropy[edit]
In 2005, TIME Magazine named her one of the 25 most influential Hispanics in America;[12] Town & Country ranked her among the young, new breed of philanthropists.[13] Tucker has also been named as an Outstanding Young Texas Ex[14] and a Distinguished Alumna at The University of Texas at Austin,[15] and she has received honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[16] Boston College[17] and the University of Maryland University College.[18]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Sara Martinez Tucker


Sara Martinez Tucker serves as guest lecturur at Notre Dame

 “I have 46.7 million kids who can’t wait  for [the education] debate to get settled.  They need help today.”
March 17, 2014


			By			Michelle Markelz






When Sara Martinez Tucker arrived at her San Francisco home and her husband opened the door, she could tell he had been crying. When he told her she needed to call her parents in Laredo, Texas, she assumed the worst. Her father answered but was too close to tears to speak. Waiting on the other end of the line, Tucker’s fear grew. She heard her father choke out, “Mijito,” calling for her younger brother to take the phone. Bracing herself, she waited for the news no one seemed willing to break. “I think dad wants you to know,” her brother began, “that I just got my college degree.” At 37 years old, Tucker’s sibling became the last of three to finish college. Before the call could end, their father left Tucker with a final thought: “All my children are college graduates. I can die in peace now.”
Even if it were common for people from Tucker’s hometown to graduate from college, her father still may have cried at her brother’s accomplishment. Like all parents, he brought up his children with the hope that they would reach their potential. But unlike many parents—especially those who themselves never benefited from higher education—he refused to compromise on his children’s education. When he hung up the phone on the day his middle child fulfilled that commitment, Tucker realized just how exceptional her childhood was, and just how much she wanted to change that fact.
“I recognized how lucky I was to have parents that valued education,” Tucker says. “They sacrificed to send me to Catholic schools, which had better education, and supported my decision to leave Laredo. Too many people don’t have all those things lined up for them. I don’t want our kids to have to depend on luck to have success in life.”
Despite growing up in a low-income household and an environment where white-collar professionals were scarce, Tucker, who is CEO of the National Math + Science Initiative (NMSI), made the most of her parents’ sacrifices and more than “made it” professionally. Not many people can look back midway through their career and say they were the CEO of anything, or that they left such a high calling to pursue even greater things—like a presidential appointment. But, after nine years of funding college dreams as CEO of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and then serving as under secretary of the Department of Education, Tucker decided to tackle the issue from another front.
“I went to Washington because one policy change can have implications for thousands of children,” she says. “But, unfortunately, education has become politicized. I have 46.7 million kids who can’t wait for that debate to get settled. They need help today.”
At NMSI, Tucker is taking the same no-compromises approach her father did. “We can’t rest while kids are in classrooms today without rigorous standards and high-quality teachers,” she says. “What gets me out of bed in the morning is getting kids the education they need to create the lives they want for themselves.”

The challenge NMSI faces is daunting, which makes the fight all the more urgent. “[Twenty] years ago, the US led the world in high school and college graduation rates,” states NMSI’s website. “Today, the US has dropped to ninth and seventh.” Two-thirds of American students are being taught math today by a teacher who didn’t study it. The figure is nearly 9 out of 10 for science. In some of the worst cases Tucker has seen, a school’s interpretation of a high school math class is teaching students to balance a checkbook. All these circumstances, under the guise of an equitable public education system, are particularly destructive for children of parents who, coming from countries where a high school education is the exception, assume the minimum education for a job with benefits is good enough. And that danger isn’t just a possibility; it’s already apparent in the lack of students studying science, technology, engineering, and/or math (STEM), let alone earning degrees in the fields.
Tucker refuses to be intimidated or adopt a defeatist attitude. NMSI’s programs are already in 28 states, and its college readiness program is in more than 550 high schools, up from 67 schools in 2009. In just one year of implementation, the NMSI program produces dramatic results: the average one-year increase in passing scores for AP math, science, and English exams in NMSI schools is 72 percent, 10 times the national average. Before the NMSI intervention, these schools had 16,481 passing exams; after just one year with NMSI, these schools had 28,274 passing exams. And after three years, the average increase in passing exams skyrockets to 144 percent.
NMSI achieves these results by removing barriers for teachers and schools and by implementing the following key elements of the program: more time on task for students, expert mentors for AP teachers, incentives for teachers and students based on success, and rigorous training for teachers—including the teachers in the middle schools that send students to these high schools. The program also supplies necessary equipment for the schools to teach AP classes and subsidizes half the cost of AP exams.
Participating schools are selected by NMSI based on factors such as demonstrated need, availability of funding—sometimes provided by a local company or an institution such as the Department of Defense—and above all, the administrators’ and teachers’ belief that “every student can learn and compete for rigorous education,” Tucker says.
Through its UTeach replication program, NMSI is expected to produce 18,000 new STEM teachers by 2025. Because UTeach teachers stay in the classroom longer—80 percent are still teaching after five years, compared to a national average of 54 percent—these 18,000 teachers will impact five million students.
The program represents a partnership within universities—35 to date across the country, with 10 more to be added in the next two years—between the colleges of natural sciences and colleges of education to transform the process of creating teachers and to emphasize content understanding. These universities recruit STEM teachers from top math and science majors early in their academic careers. To see if teaching is right for them, freshmen students are given the opportunity to experience public school teaching in well-supported environments.
The program’s graduates combine extensive content knowledge with research-based teaching strategies and project-based learning methods to ensure greater content mastery among their students. During their student-teaching experiences, the program’s participants receive personal attention and guidance from highly experienced K-12 master teachers.
When Tucker left the government sector, she decided to take a more proactive, direct approach to improving education. But she realizes NMSI cannot reform the entire system alone. Through the corporate boards she sits on, she is privy to the changing needs in the workforce of the “knowledge economy,” as she calls it. And she also knows the importance of corporate partnerships, which is why NMSI submitted its two programs to the Business Roundtable’s call for identifying the country’s top K-12 programs. Both NMSI programs were named among the 10 finalists, and the UTeach program was one of the top five.
“Government funds many programs, and some aren’t producing outcomes,” Tucker says. “Absolutely NMSI needs help and partners, but not just anyone. We’ve got to focus on the programs that are making sustainable differences. I’m going to be rooting for all 10 of the Roundtable’s finalists to get funded and be successful.”

Early life[edit]
A native of Laredo, Texas, Tucker received her undergraduate degree in journalism, graduating with honors from the University of Texas at Austin (UT). She was a general-assignments reporter for the San Antonio Express before returning to UT, where she received a master of business administration degree with high honors.
AT&T[edit]
Before joining HSF in 1997, Tucker spent 16 years at AT&T, becoming the first Latina to reach the company’s executive level. In her last assignment at the company, she served as a regional vice president for AT&T’s Global Business Communications Systems, where she led a $400 million division to its highest profit levels.[5] Prior to this, Tucker was vice president for Consumer Operations, a $370 million operation with 6,500 employees serving AT&T’s 80 million consumers. Under her leadership, this group contributed to the division’s receipt of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
Hispanic Scholarship Fund[edit]
Prior to joining the Department, Tucker worked for nine years as the CEO and president of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she aimed to double the rate of Hispanics earning college degrees. In her time at the helm of HSF, Tucker raised $280 million for scholarships, growing annual scholarships from $3 million to over $25 million, and launched community outreach programs to raise college expectations in Latino families and communities.[6] She also increased the organization’s annual budget from $3.5 million to more than $40 million, raised a landmark $50 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc,[7] and stewarded the Hispanic portion of the $1 billion Gates Millennium Scholars Program.[8]
U.S. Under Secretary of Education[edit]
Tucker was nominated for the position of U.S. Under Secretary of Education by President George W. Bush on September 5, 2006,[9] and was confirmed by the Senate on December 9, 2006. As Under Secretary, she oversaw all policies, programs and activities related to postsecondary education, vocational and adult education, and federal student aid.
During her tenure, she developed and implemented two programs to increase access to college: a joint initiative with the U.S. Treasury Department to make nearly $70 billion in 2008-09 federal student loans available during the nation’s financial crisis, an effort described by the Wall Street Journal as “one bright spot in a season of crises and bailouts,”[10] and the website, college.gov (now StudentAide.gov), which helps students and families prepare for college.
In addition to the oversight of over $32 billion in disbursed appropriations and almost 5,600 discretionary awards, Tucker provided expert testimony before Congressional committees and special hearings, led policy discussions within the Administration and with trade associations, and led or represented the United States in international delegations.
The National Math and Science Initiative[edit]
In 2013, Tucker was elected as the Chief Executive Officer of The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI),[11] a Dallas-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the improvement of student performance in the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
Recognition and philanthropy[edit]
In 2005, TIME Magazine named her one of the 25 most influential Hispanics in America;[12] Town & Country ranked her among the young, new breed of philanthropists.[13] Tucker has also been named as an Outstanding Young Texas Ex[14] and a Distinguished Alumna at The University of Texas at Austin,[15] and she has received honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[16] Boston College[17] and the University of Maryland University College.[18]

Early life[edit]
A native of Laredo, Texas, Tucker received her undergraduate degree in journalism, graduating with honors from the University of Texas at Austin (UT). She was a general-assignments reporter for the San Antonio Express before returning to UT, where she received a master of business administration degree with high honors.
AT&T[edit]
Before joining HSF in 1997, Tucker spent 16 years at AT&T, becoming the first Latina to reach the company’s executive level. In her last assignment at the company, she served as a regional vice president for AT&T’s Global Business Communications Systems, where she led a $400 million division to its highest profit levels.[5] Prior to this, Tucker was vice president for Consumer Operations, a $370 million operation with 6,500 employees serving AT&T’s 80 million consumers. Under her leadership, this group contributed to the division’s receipt of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.
Hispanic Scholarship Fund[edit]
Prior to joining the Department, Tucker worked for nine years as the CEO and president of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she aimed to double the rate of Hispanics earning college degrees. In her time at the helm of HSF, Tucker raised $280 million for scholarships, growing annual scholarships from $3 million to over $25 million, and launched community outreach programs to raise college expectations in Latino families and communities.[6] She also increased the organization’s annual budget from $3.5 million to more than $40 million, raised a landmark $50 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc,[7] and stewarded the Hispanic portion of the $1 billion Gates Millennium Scholars Program.[8]
U.S. Under Secretary of Education[edit]
Tucker was nominated for the position of U.S. Under Secretary of Education by President George W. Bush on September 5, 2006,[9] and was confirmed by the Senate on December 9, 2006. As Under Secretary, she oversaw all policies, programs and activities related to postsecondary education, vocational and adult education, and federal student aid.
During her tenure, she developed and implemented two programs to increase access to college: a joint initiative with the U.S. Treasury Department to make nearly $70 billion in 2008-09 federal student loans available during the nation’s financial crisis, an effort described by the Wall Street Journal as “one bright spot in a season of crises and bailouts,”[10] and the website, college.gov (now StudentAide.gov), which helps students and families prepare for college.
In addition to the oversight of over $32 billion in disbursed appropriations and almost 5,600 discretionary awards, Tucker provided expert testimony before Congressional committees and special hearings, led policy discussions within the Administration and with trade associations, and led or represented the United States in international delegations.
The National Math and Science Initiative[edit]
In 2013, Tucker was elected as the Chief Executive Officer of The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI),[11] a Dallas-based nonprofit organization dedicated to the improvement of student performance in the subjects of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).
Recognition and philanthropy[edit]
In 2005, TIME Magazine named her one of the 25 most influential Hispanics in America;[12] Town & Country ranked her among the young, new breed of philanthropists.[13] Tucker has also been named as an Outstanding Young Texas Ex[14] and a Distinguished Alumna at The University of Texas at Austin,[15] and she has received honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame,[16] Boston College[17] and the University of Maryland University College.[18]

Sara Martinez Tucker
By Chris TaylorMonday, Aug. 22, 2005 




WILLIAM MERCER MCLEOD FOR TIME





 



Ten years ago, Sara Martinez Tucker was the first and only Hispanic female executive at AT&T. But the job wasn't fulfilling. "I hit 40 and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life," she recalls. So she took early retirement and tried her hand at half a dozen nonprofit projects. One was the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (hsf), which back then handed out $3 million a year to 1,000 needy Latino students. As Martinez Tucker discovered, it wasn't nearly enough to cope with a growing education crisis. By 2010, 1 in 5 high school students will be Hispanic  but if the dropout rate stays the same, only 11% of them will finish college, way below the national average of 27%. "Our kids just don't see that college is possible," Martinez Tucker says. 
Martinez Tucker, 49, now the president of the fund and its CEO, threw all her business smarts into expanding its operations. She reached students  she calls them customers  by conducting town-hall meetings in 51 key markets. Meanwhile, corporate donors like Ford and Coca-Cola praised her for speaking a language they understood: return on investment. The Lilly Endowment, a private philanthropic foundation, was impressed enough to write a $50 million check. Celebrities like Jeff Garcia and Cheech Marin joined the HSF board. 


Result: 7,500 students get a share of nearly $30 million in scholarships yearly. But that, as far as Martinez Tucker is concerned, is only a start. She wants to increase the proportion of Hispanics holding college degrees to 18% by 2010 and believes that will take another $260 million a year. "I'd rather be in the business of creating role models than be a role model," she says. That is exactly what makes her one.

Former Under Secretary of Education has served as a National Education Leader 
DALLAS, Jan. 31, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI) announced Thursday that nationally recognized educator and leader Sara Martinez Tucker has been selected to lead the highly-successful education non-profit as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Tucker will join NMSI on March 1st.
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130131/DC51970-a) 
(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130131/DC51970LOGO-b) 
Tucker previously served as Under Secretary of Education in the U.S. Department of Education from 2006-2008.  Prior to that leadership role, she was CEO and President for nine years of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she raised $280 million for scholarship and community outreach programs to increase Hispanic college participation.  She also previously enjoyed a 16-year career with AT&T, last serving as regional vice president for AT&T's Global Business Communications Systems.
"NMSI will benefit immensely from the leadership skills that Sara Martinez Tucker will bring from her experience as a key official in Education Department and in the private sector.  She is well-prepared to take math and science education to new levels of achievement in the United States," said Tom Luce, chairman of the NMSI board of directors. 
As Under Secretary, Tucker oversaw all policies and programs related to postsecondary education, vocation, and adult education, as well as federal student aid.  Tucker's accomplishments included development and implementation of two signature programs to increase access to college:  a joint initiative with the U.S. Treasury Department to make nearly $70 billion in 2008-09 federal student loans available during the nation's financial crisis, and an innovative website, college.gov, to help students and families prepare for college.  
"I am most appreciative of all that NMSI has accomplished since its founding," said Tucker.  "What the staff and board have done to increase the number of students who are prepared to take rigorous college courses in mathematics and science in a relatively short period is most impressive.  I am honored to have been selected and look forward to working with the team to strengthen NMSI's impact."
Among her many honors, in 2005, TIME magazine named Tucker one of the 25 most influential  Hispanics in the U.S.  She currently serves on the board of directors of American Electric Power Company, Xerox Corporation and Teach for America. She also serves on the University of Notre Dame's Board of Trustees and Wal-Mart's External Advisory Council.
Born and raised in Laredo, Texas, Tucker earned a bachelor's degree in journalism and a master's degree in business administration from The University of Texas at Austin.  
NMSI, a non-profit organization, was launched in 2007 by top leaders in business, education, and science to transform math and science education in the United States. NMSI has trained over 60,000 K-12 teachers to inspire students to succeed in math, science and English and was selected in 2012 to establish an Educator Leader Cadre for Common Core State Standard implementation across the country.  NMSI also has gained national recognition for recruiting more college students to become dedicated math and science teachers through the UTeach program, which is transforming teacher preparation in 34 universities in 16 states.  NMSI's Advanced Placement program is increasing achievement in 462 schools in 18 states.
NMSI has received major funding support for its groundbreaking national initiatives from Exxon Mobil Corporation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, with additional support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.  For more information, please visit www.nationalmathandscience.org.

Sara Martinez Tucker












Sara Martinez TuckerSARA MARTINEZ TUCKER, Dallas, Texas, was appointed to a six-year term on The University of Texas System Board of Regents by Governor Greg Abbott in January 2015 and was confirmed by the Texas Senate on March 11, 2015.
Regent Tucker is Chairman of the Academic Affairs Committee, and serves on the Audit, Compliance, and Risk Management Committee; the Finance and Planning Committee; and the Health Affairs Committee. She also serves on the Board for Lease of University Lands and the Special Advisory Committee on the Brackenridge Tract.
She was Under Secretary at the U.S. Department of Education, nominated as the nation's top higher education official by President George W. Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. As Under Secretary, she oversaw all policies, programs, and activities related to postsecondary education, vocational and adult education, and federal student aid.
In addition to the successful oversight of over $32 billion in disbursed appropriations and more than 5,500 discretionary awards, Tucker provided expert testimony before Congressional committees and special hearings, led policy discussions within the Administration and with trade associations, and led or represented the United States in international delegations.
Tucker led the development and implementation of two signature programs to increase access to college: a joint initiative with the U.S. Treasury Department to make nearly $70 billion in 2008-09 federal student loans available during the nation’s financial crisis, an effort described by the Wall Street Journal as “one bright spot in a season of crises and bailouts,” and an innovative new website, college.gov, which helps students and families prepare for college. College.gov received Computerworld’s Laureate Medal for exceptional use of technology to better society.
Prior to joining the Department, Tucker worked for nine years as the CEO and president of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she pursued an aggressive goal to double the rate of Hispanics earning college degrees. In her time at the helm of HSF, Tucker raised $280 million for scholarships, growing annual scholarships from $3 million to over $25 million, and launching community outreach programs to raise college expectations in Latino families and communities.
Prior to joining HSF, Tucker spent 16 years at AT&T. In her last assignment at the company, she served as a regional vice president for AT&T's Global Business Communications Systems. She also served as Vice President for Consumer Operations, leading its 6,500 employees in serving AT&T's 80 million consumers. Under her leadership, this group helped its division earn the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award.
Born and raised in Laredo, Texas, she earned her bachelor's degree in journalism at The University of Texas at Austin. She worked as a reporter for the San Antonio Express News before returning to U. T. Austin to earn her master's in business administration. Tucker has been named as an Outstanding Young Texas Ex and a Distinguished Alumna at U. T. Austin and has received honorary doctorates from the University of Notre Dame, Boston College, and the University of Maryland University College.
She serves on the Boards of Directors of American Electric Power, Sprint, and Xerox. Tucker also serves on the University of Notre Dame’s Board of Trustees.
Tucker and her husband, Greg, a management consultant, live in Dallas.

Sara Martinez Tucker, Under Secretary


Print photo

Sara Martinez Tucker is the under secretary of education, the Department's top higher education official.  She was nominated to her post by President George W. Bush on Sept. 5, 2006, and confirmed by the Senate on Dec. 9, 2006.  As under secretary, she oversees all policies, programs and activities related to postsecondary education, vocational and adult education, and federal student aid.  She also is leading efforts to carry out the recommendations from Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings' Commission on the Future of Higher Education, which called for expanding the accessibility, affordability, and accountability of postsecondary education for all Americans.
Prior to joining the Department, Tucker worked for nine years as the CEO and president of the Hispanic Scholarship Fund (HSF), where she pursued an aggressive goal to double the rate of Hispanics earning college degrees by 2010. In her time at the helm of HSF, Tucker raised $280 million for scholarships and community outreach programs to raise college expectations in Latino families and communities. In 2005, she also agreed to serve on the Secretary's Higher Ed Commissionthe group whose recommendations she is now tasked with implementing.  
Born and raised in Laredo, Texas, she enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, where she earned her bachelor's degree with honors in journalism in 1976.  She worked for two years as a general assignments reporter for the San Antonio Express before returning to the University of Texas to earn her master's in business administration with high honors in 1979.  
Prior to joining HSF in 1997, Tucker spent 16 years at AT&T, becoming the first Latina to reach the company's executive level. In her last assignment at the company, she served as a regional vice president for AT&T's Global Business Communications Systems, where she led a $400 million division to its highest profit levels. Prior to this, she was vice president for Consumer Operations, a $370 million operation with 6,500 employees serving AT&T's 80 million consumers. Under her leadership, this group contributed to the division's receipt of the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Award.
Throughout her career, Tucker has served on many boards and committees, including Toyota's Diversity Advisory Board, the National Center for Educational Accountability and the National Scholarship Providers Association.  
Among her many awards and honors, Tucker was named Hispanic of the Year in 2000 by Hispanic magazine, and, in 2005, Time magazine named her one of the 25 most influential Hispanics in the United States.  
Tucker's husband, Greg, has a management consulting practice in San Francisco.
