	Attention: Caitlin Jeffs






	Dear Caitlin,






	Re:




	Acquisition of a 100% interest in the Farellon, Perth and Mateo Properties (the Properties) from Red Metal Resources Corp. (the Vendor)






	This letter of intent (

	Letter of Intent

	) is intended to set out our mutual understanding of the basic terms and conditions upon which Power Americas Minerals Corp. (

	Power Americas

	) will acquire a 100% interest in Red Metals Farellon Property as defined in Schedule A (the 

	First Option

	), a 100% interest in Red Metals Perth Property, as defined in Schedule B (the

	Second Option

	), and a 100% interest in  Red Metals Mateo Property as defined in Schedule C (the 

	Third Option

	) in exchange for an aggregate consideration of i) 25,000,000 common shares in the capital of Power Americas; and ii) a one-time payment of US$250,000. The First, Second and Third Option are hereinafter collectively referred to as the 

	Option

	.





	Two of the Farellon mining claims are under option from a third party. Power Americas intends to assume the third-party option and make two final payments of US$75,000 each to the third party vendor to complete the 100% acquisition of the two claims. The option agreements for these two claims can be found in Schedule D. There is currently registered a total of 2.5% net smelter royalties (NSRs) on the properties to four different parties. A total of 1.5% of the NSR can be purchased for cash payments to the four parties totaling US$3,850,000. The Perth Property will have a 2.5% NSR on it with a buy back of 1.5% of the NSR for US$1,000,000. The Mateo Property has various underlying NSRs with buy backs of the NSRs which will be defined in the Definitive Agreement.






	1.



	Power Americas may exercise the First Option and earn an undivided 100% interest in the Farellon Property by:





	(i)


	issuing Ten Million (10,000,000) common shares at a price of $0.145 per share in the capital of Power Americas and paying the Vendor a one-time sum of US$250,000 within 5 business days of receiving the acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange (the TSXV) to the Transaction;















	2.



	Within a period of six months from the date of exercise of the First Option, Power Americas may exercise the Second Option and earn an undivided 100% interest in the Perth Property by issuing to Red Metal either:





	(i)


	Ten Million (10,000,000) common shares at a price of $0.145 per share; or





	(ii)


	Ten Million (10,000,000) Special Warrants at a price of $0.145 per Special Warrant. Each Special Warrant is exercisable without further consideration into one common share in the capital of Power Americas.  Red Metal shall provide its undertaking that it shall not, for a period of six months from the date of TSX Venture Approval acceptance to this Transaction, acquire upon exercise of the Special Warrants, such number of common shares in the capital of Power Americas which could result in Red Metal owning greater than 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Power Americas.






	3.



	Within a period of 12 months from the date of exercise of the Second Option, Power Americas may exercise the Third Option and earn an undivided 100% interest in the Mateo Property by issuing to Red Metal either:





	(i)


	Five Million (5,000,000) common shares at a price of $0.145 per share; or





	(ii)


	Five Million (5,000,000) Special Warrants at a price of $0.145 per Special Warrant. Each Special Warrant is exercisable without further consideration into one common share in the capital of Power Americas.  Red Metal shall provide its undertaking that it shall not, for a period of 12 months from the date of TSX Venture Approval acceptance to this Transaction, acquire upon exercise of the Special Warrants, such number of common shares in the capital of Power Americas which could result in Red Metal owning greater than 10% of the issued and outstanding shares of Power Americas.






	4.




	Exclusivity






	From the date hereof until the termination of this Letter of Intent in accordance with Section 7 hereof (the 

	Exclusivity Period

	), Red Metal agrees to deal exclusively with Power Americas in connection with the Transaction. During the Exclusivity Period, neither Red Metal nor any of its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, professional advisors or other representatives will, directly or indirectly, without Power Americas prior written consent in its sole discretion: (a) solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate enquiries or submissions of proposals from, or enter into or participate in any discussion or negotiation with, any person or company other than Power Americas relating to the acquisition of the Farellon Property or any material portion of the assets of Red Metal or any of its subsidiaries; (b) furnish any information to any person or company other than Power Americas in furtherance of any of the foregoing; or (c) otherwise cooperate in any manner with, or assist or participate in, or encourage any effort or attempt by any person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing. If any such action or undertaking is currently being performed or undertaken, Red Metal will terminate such action or undertaking promptly upon signing this Letter of Intent.





	Red Metal agrees to notify Power Americas forthwith if it, or its affiliates or its or their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, professional advisors or other representatives receives, after the date hereof, any indication of interest or other communication regarding any of the foregoing and will furnish in writing to Power Americas all the terms and conditions of any such indication or communication.

	Power Americas shall complete its due diligence on Red Metal and the Properties to its entire satisfaction before the earlier of the end of the Exclusivity Period (Confirmatory Due Diligence) and 60 days from the signing of this Letter of Intent. During the Exclusivity Period, Red Metal will assist Power Americas in its due diligence investigations regarding Red Metal for the purpose of satisfying legal, including mineral title to Red Metals mineral projects, environmental and financial due diligence, and such other due diligence review as is customary in the scope of similar transactions including by providing to Power Americas on a timely basis all materials and information regarding Red Metal and its business and operations requested by Power Americas from time to time.

	Red Metal Resources signs LOI to sell Chilean Properties







	Thunder Bay, Ontario, March 1, 2017 -  Red Metal Resources Ltd. (OTCPINK:RMES)

	(Red Metal

	

	) is pleased to announce that it has signed a Letter of Intent (the

	LOI

	) with Power Americas Minerals Corp. (

	Power Americas

	) to sell on the exercise of three separate options a one hundred percent (100%) interest in the Farellon Property, a one hundred percent (100%) interest in the Perth Property and


	a one hundred percent (100%) interest in the Mateo Property. The three projects are located 150 km southwest of Copiapo, Chile,


	in the prolific Candelaria iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) belt of Chile's coastal Cordillera,


	host to the Mantoverde mine and Lundin Mining Corporation's Candelaria mine.






	Option Terms






	Pursuant to the LOI, Power Americas can acquire 100% of Red Metals Farellon, Perth, and Mateo Properties in exchange for aggregate consideration of twenty-five million (25,000,000) common shares of Power Americas Minerals Corp. and a one-time payment of US$250,000.


	The completion of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions including, but not limited to, TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) approval.





	Power Americas may exercise the first option (the 

	First Option

	) to acquire a one hundred percent (100%) interest in the Farellon Property by issuing ten million (10,000,000) common shares in the capital of Power Americas and making a one-time cash payment of US$250,000 to Red Metal within 5 business days of receiving acceptance by the TSX Venture Exchange (the TSXV) to the transaction.





	Provided Power Americas exercises the First Option it may exercise an additional option (the 

	Second Option

	) and earn an undivided 100% interest in the Perth Property by issuing to Red Metal ten million (10,000,000) common shares in the capital of Power Americas or ten million (10,000,000) Special Warrants within six months from the date the First Option has been exercised. Each Special Warrant will be exercisable into one common share in the capital of Power Americas without further consideration.





	Subject to Power Americas exercising the Second Option it may exercise the final option (the 

	Third Option

	) and earn an undivided 100% interest in the Mateo Property by issuing to Red Metal five million (5,000,000) common shares in the capital of Power Americas or five million (5,000,000) Special Warrants within six months from the date the Second Option has been exercised. Each Special Warrant will be exercisable into one common share in the capital of Power Americas without further consideration. There are no work commitments with any of the Property Option Agreements.


















	Farellon Property






	The Farellon Property includes a 100% interest in six claims and an option to earn a 100% interest in two additional claims.


	Two claims on the Farellon Property have remaining payments of US$75,000 each to the underlying vendors. The property


	is located 150 km southwest of Copiapo, Chile, and consists of a total of 1,234 hectares in the Carrizal Alto mining district, more precisely 3 km southwest of the historic Carrizal Alto mine. It is easily accessible year-round by dirt roads and is located in close proximity to power, water and a major urban centre, Copiapo, with a readily available mining workforce. The eight mining claims have net smelter royalties (NSR) of 2.5% registered to a variety of holders,


	with an option to buy back up to 1.5% of all NSRs for an aggregate payments of US$3,850,000.





	Historical records indicate that copper mining commenced at Carrizal Alto in the 1820s and continued on a significant scale, mostly by British companies until 1891 when disastrous flooding occurred and the mines were closed. Historical reports indicate that the larger mines were obtaining good grades over significant widths in the bottom workings at the time of closure.  It is estimated that during this period, over 3 million tonnes of mineralized material with grades in excess of 5% copper and widths of 8 m were extracted, including a large quantity of direct shipping mineralized material at 12% copper (Source: Ulriksen, C. (1991), Carrizal Alto Mining District, Vallenar, III Region, Chile, 7 p.).





	Work completed to date on the Farellon Property has been focused on a 1.6 kilometre stretch of mineralized veins hosted in a 10 to 25-metre-wide shear zone, a further 2.5 kilometres of this shear zone have been explored on surface and show similar geology and mineralization on surface as the zone that had been previously drilled. A total of 6,992 metres of drilling has been completed in three programs along a 1.3 km strike length. The property has been primarily explored for copper and gold, but there is unexplored potential for cobalt and silver on the property. The following table summarizes some of the best results obtained to date.

	The table above shows grades and widths of mineralization which are consistent with historic drilling results and have also given valuable geological information showing multiple veins and the potential for wide zones of economic mineralization. The true width of the drill hole intersections cannot be determined from the information available, as it was RC drilling.





	In 2014, Red Metal entered into a contract with a Chilean artisanal miner allowing the artisanal miner to mine on the Farellon property in return for a 10% net sales royalty. In January 2015, the artisanal miner began selling mineralized material to ENAMI, a Chilean national mining company, and to date has sold approximately 10,000 tonnes of sulphide mineralized material grading 1.82% Cu, 6.56 g/t Ag and 0.25 g/t Au, as well as 1,813 tonnes of oxide mineralized material grading 1.56% Cu. (Source: RMES Annual and Quarterly Reports).






	Perth Property






	The Perth Property consists of 12 mining claims totaling 2,245 hectares in the Carrizal Alto mining district. It is contiguous to the Farellon Property, but geologically different. The property will have a 2.5% NSR on it with an option to buy back up to 1.5% of the NSR for aggregate payments of US$1,000,000.





	The property has been known to host gold and copper mineralization since the early 1900s when it was part of the Carrizal Alto mining complex. Modern exploration on the property started in 2008 and multiple surface mapping, trenching and drilling programs have been completed. More than 12 mineralized veins have been identified on the property. Significant results obtained from surface channel sampling are listed in the table below.

	Mateo Property






	The Mateo Property is a copper-gold-silver project consisting of mining 7 claims totalling 500 hectares located approximately 10 km east of Vallenar.





	The property has undergone limited modern exploration including surface and underground RC drilling and artisanal mining on three separate mine sites, the Irene, Margarita and Santa Theresa mines.





	In 2011, Red Metal carried out an in-depth geological mapping and sampling program on the property. A total of 138 reconnaissance samples were collected. The highest assay values returned from reconnaissance samples were 21 g/t Au and 10.3% Cu, with more common values ranging between 1-3 g/t Au and 1-3% Cu. Detailed mapping identified nine significant mineralized zones where further work is recommended.





	The technical content of this news release has been reviewed and approved by Caitlin Jeffs, P. Geo., President of the Company, and a qualified person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.

	Why Chile, III Region?

	Red Metal is focused on exploration in the Coastal Cordillera of the III Region Chile.


		The world’s leading copper producing country.

		According to the 2011 Fraser Institute Survey of Mining: “Chile is the only jurisdiction outside North America that has consistently been in the top 10” and ranks 1st in Current Mineral Potential.

		Chile’s III Region was the mining center for copper, gold and silver starting in the 16th century

		With the discovery of large porphyry deposits inland, mining halted on the Coastal Cordillera

		Mechanized mining methods and exploration techniques have improved over the last century providing the region with new potential

		Present day mining includes large iron mines and revived small scale copper, gold and silver mines as well as several large IOCG copper gold mines such as Candelaria and Mantoverde

		Compared with jurisdiction such as Ontario, Canada, the coastal cordillera of Chile remains relatively unexplored

Welcome

	Red Metal Resources Ltd. is a US-listed mineral exploration company focused on aggressive growth through acquiring, exploring and developing copper-gold assets in Chile's III Region.

	As the world's leading copper producing nation, Chile is famous for world-class, low-grade, high-tonnage deposits and possesses massive potential in undeveloped mid-sized, high-grade, copper-gold deposits. Chile has consistently been ranked as one of the most politically stable countries in which to invest, contains excellent infrastructure and possesses a mining-educated workforce.

	Our projects are located in the prolific Candelaria iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) belt of Chile's coastal Cordillera, host to Freeport McMoRan'sCandelaria Mine and Anglo American's Mantoverde Mine.

	In addition to possessing highly-prospective projects in a world-class mining jurisdiction, Red Metal's management has a strong geological and exploration background, complemented by financial and business expertise. We believe that these factors set us apart from the majority of junior resource companies.

Candelaria IOCG Belt, Chile

1,184 hectares of mining and exploration claims covering ground in the same belt and formation as Freeport McMoran’s Candelaria mine
Explored by ENAMI, the Chilean national mining company, in 1994
Mining results from 1994-1997 by ENAMI show 16,000 tonnes mined grading an average of 3.15% copper, 45.2 g/t silver and .74 g/t gold
15 kilometres from the ENAMI state owned Cu oxide processing plant

Red Metal Resources Ltd. is an aggressive mineral exploration company
with 4 copper-gold projects in the prolific Candelaria Iron Oxide Copper-
Gold (IOCG) belt in Chile’s III Region. Chile is the world’s leading producer
of copper and one of the most stable, mining-friendly jurisdictions globally.
The IOCG belt is home to Lundin Mining's Candelaria Mine, Anglo
American's Mantoverde Mine and Capstone’s Santo Domingo deposit.
19% of world copper production is from mines producing less than 50kt of
copper a year. 35% of the worlds copper is produced in Chile. Eight mines
in the world produce greater than 400kt per year.
Red Metal, a company with a very tight share structure, has a realistic
objective of discovering a sizable copper-gold resource in the medium term.
With mid-size and major mining companies from around the world vying for
a foothold in Chile’s IOCG belt, Red Metal is extremely well positioned to
capitalize on this opportunity.

Chile has consistently been ranked as one of the most politically stable countries in which to invest, contains excellent infrastructure and possesses a mining-educated workforce.Our projects are located in the prolific Candelaria iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) belt of Chile's coastal Cordillera, host to Freeport McMoRan'sCandelaria Mine and Anglo American's Mantoverde Mine.In addition to possessing highly-prospective projects in a world-class mining jurisdiction, Red Metal's management has a strong geological and exploration background, complemented by financial and business expertise. We believe that these factors set us apart from the majority of junior resource companies.Company NameRed Metal Resources LtdBusiness CategoryMinerals RecyclingAddressSuite D 1158 Russell StThunder BayOntarioCanadaPresidentCaitlin JeffsYear EstablishedNAEmployees10MembershipsNAHours of OperationNACompany ServicesMineral Exploration

Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed by Red Metal Resources Ltd. contains
forward-looking statements. These are statements regarding financial and
operating performance and results and other statements that are not historical
facts. The words "expect," "project," "estimate," "believe," "anticipate,"
"intend," "plan," "forecast," and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. Certain important risks could cause results to
differ materially from those anticipated by some of the forward-looking
statements. Some, but not all, of these risks include, among other things:
·
general economic conditions, because they may affect our ability to raise money;
·
our ability to raise enough money to continue our operations;
·
changes in regulatory requirements that adversely affect our business;
·
changes in the prices for minerals that adversely affect our business;
·
political changes in Chile, which could affect our interests there; and / or
·
other uncertainties, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are
beyond our control.
We caution you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which reflect our management's view only as of the date of this report. We are
not obligated to update these statements or publicly release the results of any
revisions to them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this
report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should refer
to, and carefully review, the information in future documents we file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
General
You should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our interim
unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this
Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31,
2017. The inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information may
require us to make estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present, in
all material respects, our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to
our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole. Actual
results may vary from the estimates and assumptions we make.
Overview
Red Metal Resources Ltd. ("Red Metal", or the "Company") is a mineral
exploration company engaged in locating, and eventually developing, mineral
resources in Chile. Our business strategy is to identify, acquire and explore
prospective mineral claims with a view to either developing them ourselves or,
more likely, finding a joint venture partner with the mining experience and
financial means to undertake the development. All of our claims are in the
Candelaria IOCG belt in the Chilean Coastal Cordillera.
Consistent with our historical practices, we continue to monitor our costs in
Chile by reviewing our mineral claims to determine whether they possess the
geological indicators to economically justify the capital to maintain or explore
them. Currently, our subsidiary, Minera Polymet SpA, has two employees in Chile
and engages independent consultants on as needed basis. Most of our support -
such as vehicles, office and equipment - is supplied under short-term contracts.
The only long-term commitments that we have are for royalty payments on four of
our mineral claims - Farellon Alto 1-8, Quina 1 - 56, Exeter 1 - 54, and Che.
These royalties are payable once exploitation begins. We are also required to
pay property taxes that are due annually on all the claims that are included in
our properties.
The cost and timing of all planned exploration programs are subject to the
availability of qualified mining personnel, such as consulting geologists,
geo-technicians and drillers, and drilling equipment. Although Chile has a
well-trained and qualified mining workforce from which to draw and few
early-stage companies such as ours are competing for the available resources, if
we are unable to find the personnel and equipment that we need when we need them
and at the prices that we have estimated today, we might have to revise or
postpone our plans.

Recent Corporate Events
On February 28, 2017, we signed a letter of intent ("LOI") with Power Americas
Minerals Corp ("Power Americas") to sell on the exercise of three separate
options all our interest in the Farellon Property, the Perth Property and the
Mateo Property in exchange for aggregate consideration of twenty-five million
common shares of Power Americas and a one-time payment of US$250,000.
The completion of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions
including, but not limited to, a customary due-diligence undertaken by Power
Americas as well as an approval from TSX Venture Exchange (the "TSXV").
Pursuant to the LOI, Power Americas may exercise the first option (the "First
Option") to acquire a 100% interest in the Farellon Property by issuing ten
million common shares at a price of $0.145 per share in the capital of Power
Americas and by making a one-time cash payment of US$250,000 to us within five
business days of receiving acceptance by the TSXV of the transaction.
Provided Power Americas exercises the First Option, it may exercise an
additional option (the "Second Option") and earn an undivided 100% interest in
the Perth Property by issuing to us ten million common shares at a price of
$0.145 per share in the capital of Power Americas, or by issuing to us ten
million special warrants (the "Special Warrants") within six months from the
date of the exercise of the First Option.
Provided Power Americas exercises the Second Option, it may exercise the final
option (the "Third Option") and earn an undivided 100% interest in the Mateo
Property by issuing to us five million common shares at a price of $0.145 per
share in the capital of Power Americas or by issuing to us five million Special
Warrants within six months from the date of the exercise of the Second Option.
Each Special Warrant will be exercisable without further consideration into one
common share in the capital of Power Americas at a deemed price of $0.145 per
share.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

(RMES) ("Red Metal") is pleased to report that it has signed a Letter of Intent ("LOI") to sell, pursuant to a takeover bid, business combination or similar transaction, all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Metal Resources Ltd., namely 34,290,302 common shares, as well as all of the common shares of Red Metal that may be issued upon the exercise of any options, warrants or other convertible securities after the formal filing of the transaction but before its closing (the "Transaction"). The proposal would be that such Red Metal shareholders will receive in exchange an aggregate consideration of CAD$3,250,000 payable through: (i) the payment in cash of the Red Metal's debts for a maximum amount of CAD$500,000; and (ii) for the remainder of the aggregate consideration, the issuance of class "A" common shares of the capital stock of TomaGold at a price that is the higher between the average market price over the 20 days before the execution date of the Definitive Agreement and of CAD$0.15, subject to a maximum price of CAD$0.20. The parties to the transaction are at arm's length.The LOI includes customary provisions, including non-solicitation of alternative transactions, the right to match superior proposals and the closing by TomaGold of a financing of CAD$700,000 before the closing of the Transaction. The parties have agreed to a break-up fee of CAD$175,000 (i) payable to TomaGold if Red Metal is in default of this LOI and if a superior proposal is accepted by Red Metal's shareholders, and (ii) payable to Red Metal if TomaGold does not complete the Transaction for reasons other than discovering an issue with their confirmatory due diligence.Red Metal owns, or has the option to own, 100% of three projects (Farellon, Perth and Mateo) located in the prolific Candelaria iron oxide copper-gold (IOCG) belt of Chile's coastal Cordillera, host to Freeport McMoRan's Candelaria Mine and Anglo American's Mantoverde Mine.Farellon property(100% interest in six claims and option to earn a 100% interest in two claims)The Farellon property is located 150 km southwest of Copiapo, Chile, and consists of eight mining claims totalling 1,234 hectares in the Carrizal Alto mining district, more precisely 3 km southwest of the historic Carrizal Alto mine. It is easily accessible year-round by dirt roads and is located close to power, water and a major urban centre, Copiapo, with a readily available mining workforce.Historical records indicate that copper mining commenced at Carrizal Alto in the 1820s and continued on a significant scale, mostly by British companies, until 1891 when disastrous flooding occurred and mines closed. Historical reports indicate that the larger mines were obtaining good grades over significant widths in the bottom workings at the time of closure.  It is estimated that during this period, over 3 million tonnes with grades in excess of 5% copper and widths of 8 m was extracted, including a large quantity of direct shipping mineralized material at 12% copper (Source: Ulriksen, C. (1991), Carrizal Alto Mining District, Vallenar, III Region, Chile, 7 p.).Work completed to date on the Farellon property has been focused on a 1.6 kilometres stretch of mineralized veins hosted in a 10 to 25-metre-wide shear zone, a further 2.5 kilometres of this shear zone have been explored on surface and show similar geology and mineralization on surface as the zone that has been previously drilled. A total of 6,992 metres of drilling was completed in three programs along a 1.3 km strike length. The following table summarizes the best results obtained to date.

The true width of the drill hole intersections cannot be determined from the information available, as it was RC drilling.In 2014, Red Metal entered into a contract with a Chilean artisanal miner allowing the artisanal miner to mine on the Farellon property in return for a 10% net sales royalty.  In January 2015 the artisanal miner first started selling mineralized material to ENAMI, a Chilean national mining company, and has since sold 9,953 tonnes of sulphide mineralized material grading 1.82% Cu, 6.56 g/t Ag and 0.25 g/t Au, as well as 1,813 tonnes of oxide mineralized material grading 1.56% Cu (Source:RMES Annual and Quarterly Reports).Read MoreIn April 2015, the artisanal miner received all the necessary permits allowing them to increase their operations from 500 tonnes per month to 5,000 tonnes per month. Continued expansion of the Farellon property's small-scale mining operation, through minimal capital expenditures, could significantly increase revenues and provide important geological and metallurgical information.Perth property(100% interest)The Perth property consists of 12 mining claims totaling 2,245 hectares in the Carrizal Alto mining district. It is contiguous to the Farellon project, but geologically different. The property has been known to host gold and copper mineralization since the early 1900 when it was part of the Carrizal Alto mining complex. Modern exploration on the property started in 2008 and multiple surface mapping, trenching and drilling programs have been completed since then. More than 12 mineralized veins have been identified on the property. Significant results obtained from surface channel sampling are listed in the table below.
