      --$19,152,000c class E 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;

      (a) Notional amount and interest only.

      be exchanged for class A-S, class B, and class C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Feb. 10, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $38,303,883 
      non-rated class or the $69,425,883 interest-only class X-C.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 51 loans secured by 83 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $957.6 million as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; Redwood Commercial 
      Mortgage Corporation; Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC; and RAIT 
      Funding, LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.7% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 71.9%, and asset summary reviews on 71.9% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.16x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 100.4%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.1%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 6.8% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has slightly lower leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 100.4% is 
      below the 2013 average of 101.6%. However, excluding the credit opinion 
      loan, the pool's Fitch LTV is 103.5%. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.16x is 
      below the 2013 average of 1.29x. The conduit DSCR is 1.15x, excluding 
      the credit opinion loans.
    

      Pool Concentration: The pool is more concentrated by loan size and 
      sponsor than average transactions from 2013, as evidenced by a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 479 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      of 479. Also the 10 largest loans represent 58.6% of the total pool 
      balance, which is higher than the average 2013 top 10 concentration of 
      54.5%.
    

      High Retail Concentration: The pool has an above- average concentration 
      of retail properties at 52.4%. Six of the 10 largest assets are retail 
      properties. The average retail concentration in 2013 was 33.2%. The 
      largest property type is retail (52.4%), followed by multifamily (13.9%) 
      and hotel (11.9%).
    

      Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, Miami International 
      Mall (10.4%), has a Fitch credit opinion 'BBB-sf' on a stand-alone 
      basis. The loan is collateralized by a super-regional mall in Miami, FL. 
      This loan participation is a $100 million, controlling pari passu 
      portion of a $160 million loan.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Fitch performed two model-based break-even analyses to determine the 
      level of cash flow and value deterioration the pool could withstand 
      prior to $1 of loss being experienced by the 'BBB-sf' and 'AAAsf' rated 
      classes. Fitch found that the JPMBB 2014-C18 pool could withstand a 
      62.0% decline in value (based on appraised values at issuance) and an 
      approximately 19.6% decrease to the most recent actual cash flow prior 
      to experiencing a $1 of loss to the 'BBB-sf' rated class. Additionally, 
      Fitch found that the pool could withstand a 69.4% decline in value and 
      an approximately 35.3% decrease in the most recent actual cash flow 
      prior to experiencing $1 of loss to any 'AAAsf' rated class.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying pre-sale report.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, rated 'CMS1-' by 
      Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners, LLC, rated 'CSS1-' by 
      Fitch.

Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C18 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C18
    





November 10, 2016 02:06 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2014-C18. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are the result of stable performance since issuance. As 
      of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 17.1% to $928.1 million from $1.12 billion 
      at issuance. No loans are defeased. There are four loans on the master 
      servicer's watchlist (8.0%), two of which are due to deferred 
      maintenance, including the fourth largest loan, Waterstone Retail 
      Portfolio. All of the watchlist loans, however, remain current and Fitch 
      has not designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern.
    

      Stable Performance: As of the October 2016 distribution, property level 
      performance was generally in line with issuance expectations and there 
      have been no material changes to pool metrics.
    

      Pool Concentration: The 10 largest loans represent 59.2% of the total 
      pool balance, which is higher than similar vintage transactions.
    

      High Retail Concentration: The pool has an above-average concentration 
      of retail properties at 51.2%. Eight of the top 15 largest assets are 
      retail properties. The average retail concentration for transactions 
      issued in 2013 was 33.2%.
    

      The largest loan in the pool, Miami International Mall (10.8%), is 
      collateralized by a super-regional mall in Miami, FL. This loan 
      participation is a $100 million, controlling pari-passu portion of a 
      $160 million loan. As of year-end 2015, the property's net operating 
      income (NOI) was reported to be $21.2 million, which is an increase of 
      6.6% from issuance. The servicer reported debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) for the same period was 2.95x, an improvement from 2.77x at 
      issuance. Occupancy was reported to be slightly lower at 90% as of June 
      2016 compared to 94% at issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable due to stable 
      collateral performance. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative 
      ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes 
      the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes:
    

      --$22.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$23.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$695.9 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$161.6 million class EC at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56.3 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19.2 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional and interest-only.
    

      Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for a related amount of 
      class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may be exchanged for 
      class A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class NR and X-C certificates. Fitch previously 
      withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X-B certificates.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia

Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C18
























CHICAGO, Nov 10, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2014-C18. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are the result of stable performance since issuance. As 
      of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 17.1% to $928.1 million from $1.12 billion 
      at issuance. No loans are defeased. There are four loans on the master 
      servicer's watchlist (8.0%), two of which are due to deferred 
      maintenance, including the fourth largest loan, Waterstone Retail 
      Portfolio. All of the watchlist loans, however, remain current and Fitch 
      has not designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern.


                                        








Stable Performance: As of the October 2016 distribution, property level 
      performance was generally in line with issuance expectations and there 
      have been no material changes to pool metrics.


                                        








Pool Concentration: The 10 largest loans represent 59.2% of the total 
      pool balance, which is higher than similar vintage transactions.


                                        








High Retail Concentration: The pool has an above-average concentration 
      of retail properties at 51.2%. Eight of the top 15 largest assets are 
      retail properties. The average retail concentration for transactions 
      issued in 2013 was 33.2%.


                                        








The largest loan in the pool, Miami International Mall (10.8%), is 
      collateralized by a super-regional mall in Miami, FL. This loan 
      participation is a $100 million, controlling pari-passu portion of a 
      $160 million loan. As of year-end 2015, the property's net operating 
      income (NOI) was reported to be $21.2 million, which is an increase of 
      6.6% from issuance. The servicer reported debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) for the same period was 2.95x, an improvement from 2.77x at 
      issuance. Occupancy was reported to be slightly lower at 90% as of June 
      2016 compared to 94% at issuance.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable due to stable 
      collateral performance. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative 
      ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes 
      the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.


                                        








Fitch has affirmed the following classes:

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2014-C18. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are the result of stable performance since issuance. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 17.1% to $928.1 million from $1.12 billion at issuance. No loans are defeased. There are four loans on the master servicer's watchlist (8.0%), two of which are due to deferred maintenance, including the fourth largest loan, Waterstone Retail Portfolio. All of the watchlist loans, however, remain current and Fitch has not designated any loans as Fitch Loans of Concern.Stable Performance: As of the October 2016 distribution, property level performance was generally in line with issuance expectations and there have been no material changes to pool metrics.Pool Concentration: The 10 largest loans represent 59.2% of the total pool balance, which is higher than similar vintage transactions.High Retail Concentration: The pool has an above-average concentration of retail properties at 51.2%. Eight of the top 15 largest assets are retail properties. The average retail concentration for transactions issued in 2013 was 33.2%.The largest loan in the pool, Miami International Mall (10.8%), is collateralized by a super-regional mall in Miami, FL. This loan participation is a $100 million, controlling pari-passu portion of a $160 million loan. As of year-end 2015, the property's net operating income (NOI) was reported to be $21.2 million, which is an increase of 6.6% from issuance. The servicer reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) for the same period was 2.95x, an improvement from 2.77x at issuance. Occupancy was reported to be slightly lower at 90% as of June 2016 compared to 94% at issuance.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable due to stable collateral performance. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following classes:--$22.7 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$85.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$23.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$87.5 million class A-4A1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$87.5 million class A-4A2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$267 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$67.4 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$55.1 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$695.9 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$69.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$37.1 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$161.6 million class EC at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$56.3 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$19.2 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$12 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.*Notional and interest-only.Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for a related amount of class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, B and C certificates.Fitch does not rate the class NR and X-C certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X-B certificates.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchJ.P.

DETAILS OF THIS SERVICE FOR RATINGS FOR WHICH THE LEAD ANALYST IS BASED IN AN EU-REGISTERED ENTITY CAN BE FOUND ON THE ENTITY SUMMARY PAGE FOR THIS ISSUER ON THE FITCH WEBSITE.Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
