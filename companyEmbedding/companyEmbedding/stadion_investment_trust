Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Investment Approach

Core Equity Fund That Can Become Defensive A Risk Adjusted Approach to Security SelectionHow we manage the fund:ResearchSharpe ratio research is conducted daily on almost 2,000 ETFs. Sharpe ratio, developed by Nobel Laureate William F. Sharpe, has become the industry standard for calculating risk-adjusted return of a portfolio.AnalysisSharpe ratio is a tool to compare risk and return characteristics of different types of ETFs. We identify ETFs with persistently high or growing Sharpe ratios.SelectionAs market conditions and Sharpe ratios change, the fund can reduce or increase equity exposure. A diversified portfolio of 8-15 ETFs is constructed accounting for market volatility and return potential. Fund Quarter-End AllocationsThe Stadion Tactical Growth Fund shifts between domestic equity ETFs, international equity ETFs, and a defensive allocation based on our proprietary Sharpe ratio analysis.Portfolio allocations are a historical reference and no guarantee of how the portfolio will be allocated in the future. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Allocations are subject to change. 1Average quarterly allocation of international and equity ETFs.Investment results are best measured in full market cycles.Since the Last PeakThe Stadion Tactical Growth Fund losses from the 2007 – 2009 global financial crisis were recovered by the Fund by 12/23/09. In comparison, the S&P 500 Index recovery took an additional 2 years, until 4/2/12.Performance data quotes represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please review the Investment Performance disclosures that are integral to your investment decision process. The hypothetical examples do not represent the returns of any particular investment. One cannot invest directly in an index. Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. 1BarUS Agg = Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index.ETF RiskThere are additional costs and potential risks associated with investing in domestic and international exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investments in equities, including ETFs, are subject to market risks, sector risks, tracking risks, ETF net asset value and market price risks. Additionally, investors will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which a Stadion portfolio invests. International investing involves certain risks not usually associated with domestic investing, including currency fluctuation, economic and political volatility, foreign taxation and differences in financial standards.

The Expense Limitation Agreement may be terminated by the Stadion Investment Trust or the Adviser at the end of its then-current term upon not less than 90 days' notice. 3In the case of investment at or above the $1 million breakpoint (where you do not pay an initial sales charge), a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge ("CDSC") may be assessed on shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase. 4The 12b-1 fee may be used to compensate broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries for ongoing record keeping and administrative services that would otherwise be performed by the Funds' administrator or transfer agent. 5A 1.00% CDSC will be assessed on shares redeemed within 12 months of purchase.The Growth Fund’s investment adviser, Stadion Money Management, LLC (the “Adviser”) has entered into an Expense Limitation Agreement with the Growth Fund under which it has contractually agreed to waive Management Fees and to assume other expenses of the Growth Fund, if necessary, in an amount that limits annual operating expenses (exclusive of interest expense on any borrowings, taxes, brokerage commissions, extraordinary expenses, Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses and payments, if any, under a Rule 12b-1 Distribution Plan) of Class A, Class C and Class I shares to not more than 1.30% of the average daily net assets allocable to each Class of the Growth Fund.

The Morningstar Target Risk Index family is designed to meet the needs of investors who would like to maintain a target level of equity exposure through a portfolio diversified across equities, bonds and inflation-hedged instruments. The Morningstar Moderately Aggressive Target Risk Index seeks approximately 80% global equity exposure. The S&P 500 Index is the Standard & Poor’s Composite Index of 500 stocks and is a widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices. One cannot invest directly in an index.The Statistics presented are defined as follows. Beta is a measure of systematic risk, or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies that you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta. The Sharpe ratio measures the excess return per unit of deviation, or risk. Correlation is a measure of how investments move in relation to one another. A correlation of 1 means the two asset classes move exactly in line with each other, while a correlation of -1 means they move in the exact opposite direction.Investment Risks:Investment in the Fund is subject to investment risks, including, without limitation, market risk, management style risk, risks related to “fund of funds” structure, sector risk, fixed income risk, tracking risk, risks related to ETF net asset value and market price, foreign securities risk, risks related to portfolio turnover and small capitalization companies risk. Since the Fund is a “fund of funds,” an investor will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which the Fund invests in addition to the Fund’s direct fees and expenses. More information about these risks and other risks can be found in the Fund’s prospectus.© 2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete, or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history.  Exchange traded funds and open ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.  It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-,five-,and 10 year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.  The weights are 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five year rating/40%three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10 year rating/30%five-year rating/20%three year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10 year overall rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10 year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. For 1 year performance, the fund ranked in the 14th percentile out of 302 funds. Stadion Tactical Growth Fund was rated against the following numbers of U.S.-domiciled Tactical Allocation funds over the following time periods: 249 funds in the last three years, 176 funds in the last five years, and 66 funds in the last 10 years. With respect to these Tactical Allocation funds, the Stadion Tactical Growth Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 5 stars, 4 stars and 4 stars for the three-, five- and 10-year periods, respectively. 4 star overall rating out of 249 Tactical Allocation funds as of 6-30-17. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Morningstar Rating is for the I share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.

The fund structure is designed to automatically decrease equities and increase fixed income positions as it approaches the retirement date, giving participants less equity exposure as they have fewer and fewer years to make up any losses. At Stadion, we’ve taken target date funds one step further by actively managing the asset allocation within the glide path.

Investment Approach

Stadion reacts to market movements instead of predict them.
We believe evaluating and managing risk in the market is fundamental. That’s why within the Stadion Flex Target Date CIT Series portfolios, there are three key components: equity, fixed income and “Flex”—the portion that we actively manage.
Portfolio components
Equity:

Persistent equity exposure
Provides broad market exposure (large cap, mid cap, small cap and international)
Periodically adjusts holdings based on shifts within the markets

Example: Can add exposure to emerging markets
Flex:

Tactical asset allocation strategy drives portfolio allocation
Dynamic sell criteria
Adjusts equity exposure as determined by our model

Example: This portion can be invested in 100% equity positions or 100% cash/cash equivalent positions
Fixed Income:

Persistent fixed income exposure
Generally high-quality, low-duration positions
Periodically adjusts holdings based on shifts within the market

Example: Can shorten duration should interest rates start to rise
The glide path
As the investor nears retirement, the equity component allocations decrease while the fixed income allocation increases. In the early years, Stadion manages the Flex component with an emphasis on aggressive market exposure. Over time, we manage the Flex portion with an increasingly conservative emphasis on market exposure.


The allocated percentages above are approximate, may change based on market conditions, and may vary based on retirement plan provider.
*Low-Risk Environment and High-Risk Environment refer to risk levels in equity markets as determined by Stadion's model.

Some of the principal risks associated with investing in this Fund include:
Loss of Money
Since the investment’s market value may fluctuate up and down, an investor may lose money when he or she buys or sells the investment, including part of the principal.
Market/Market Volatility
The market value of the portfolio’s securities may fall rapidly or unpredictably due to changing economic, political or market conditions, which may reduce the value of the portfolio.
Inflation/Deflation
Inflation may cause the present value of future payments to decrease, causing a decline in the future value of assets or income. Deflation causes prices to decline throughout the economy over time, impacting issuers’ creditworthiness and increasing their risk for default, which may reduce the value of the portfolio.
Active Management
Performance is subject to the risk that the advisor’s investment strategies are not suited to achieving the investment objective or do not perform as expected, which may cause the portfolio to lose value or underperform investments with similar objectives and strategies.
Portfolio Turnover
Engaging in active trading may create high portfolio turnover, or a turnover of 100% or more, resulting in increased transaction costs.
Exchange Traded Funds
Assets invested in ETFs generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying securities they are designed to track, although they may be subject to greater liquidity risks and higher costs than owning the underlying securities directly due to their management fees.
Underlying Fund (also known as Fund of Funds, or Subsidiary)
A portfolio’s risks are closely associated with the risks of the securities and other investments held by the underlying funds, and the ability of the portfolio to meet its investment objective likewise depends on the ability of the underlying funds to meet their objectives.
Fixed Income Securities
The value of assets invested in fixed-income or debt securities may be susceptible to general movements in the bond market and are subject to increased interest rate and credit risk.
Equity Securities
The value of equity securities, which include common, preferred and convertible preferred stocks, will fluctuate based on changes in their issuers’ financial conditions as well as overall market and economic conditions, and can decline in the event of deteriorating issuer, market or economic conditions.
Foreign Securities
Assets invested in foreign securities may be subject to increased volatility as the value of these securities changes more rapidly and extremely than the value of U.S. securities. Foreign securities are subject to increased issuer risk, since foreign issuers may not experience the same degree of regulation as U.S. issuers, and are held to different reporting, accounting and auditing standards. In addition, foreign securities are subject to increased costs, since there are generally higher commission rates on transactions, transfer taxes, higher custodial costs and the potential for foreign tax charges on dividend and interest payments. Many foreign markets are relatively small, and securities issued in less developed countries face the risks of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, and adverse changes in investment or exchange control regulations, including suspension of the ability to transfer currency from a country. Political changes or diplomatic developments can also negatively impact performance.
Emerging Markets
Assets invested in emerging market securities may be subject to a greater extent to market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political and other risks compared to assets invested in developed foreign countries.
Other
The investment’s performance may be impacted by its concentration in a certain type of security, adherence to a particular investing strategy or unique aspect of its structure and costs.
The Stadion Flex Target Date Collective Investment Trust Series are funds that are Collective Investment Trusts (CIT) created by Benefit Trust Company and administered by Benefit Trust Company, as trustee. Its shares are not deposits of Benefit Trust Company and are not insured by the FDIC or any other agency. The CIT is not a mutual fund. The CIT is a security which has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and is exempt from investment company registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940. As market conditions fluctuate, the investment return and principal value of any investment will change. Diversification may not protect against market risk. There are risks involved with investing, including possible loss of principal. Stadion utilizes ETFs as the primary underlying investment vehicle in the CITs. There are additional costs and potential risks associated with investing in domestic and international Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs). Investment in the funds is subject to investment risks, including, without limitation, market risk, management style risk, risks related to “fund of funds” structure, sector risk, fixed income risk, tracking risk, risks related to ETF net asset value and market price, foreign securities risk, risks related to portfolio turnover and small capitalization companies risk. Since each Stadion CIT is a “fund of funds” an investor will indirectly bear fees and expenses charged by the underlying ETFs and investment companies in which a Stadion CIT invests in addition to the Stadion CIT’s direct fees and expenses. This material should not be viewed as advice or recommendations with respect to asset allocation or any particular investment. Before investing in any investment portfolio, the client and financial professional should carefully consider client investment objective, time horizon, risk tolerance, and fees.
Performance results shown are net of each Fund’s fees and the fees and expenses of the underlying ETFs and CIFs. Certain fees may not be immediately reflected in the performance figures due to a limited number of assets in a particular Fund. Such fees will be accrued and ultimately included  in the performance results. Performance results include reinvestment of all dividends and distributions. Performance results include changes in principal value and assume reinvestment of all dividends and capital gain distributions. For periods of less than 1 year, return figures are not annualized and represent aggregate total return. The comparative performance results shown for the S&P 500 Index and the S&P Target Date Index Series demonstrate how the U.S. stock and bond markets performed generally during the same periods, and how a hypothetical investment in either market alone or the asset mixes shown would have performed during such periods. 
The S&P Target Date Index Series is composed of eleven multi-asset class indices, each corresponding to a particular target retirement date. The asset class mix for each index is determined once a year through a process designed to reflect the overall investment opportunity of the represented markets.  Each index is fully investable, with varying levels of exposure to equities and fixed income. To create its target date benchmark, S&P Indices conducts an annual survey of target date funds each year in April. Funds are required by the SEC to report their holdings quarterly. At the time of the annual index review, it was the most recent quarterly holdings data for each fund in its survey. The overall process is as follows: Funds are identified as Target Date funds from the Morningstar or Lipper databases and sorted by asset size. Fund families not meeting the minimum asset threshold of US  $100 million are removed from consideration. Fund holdings are drawn from the latest period available using commercial databases and the SEC’s Edgar web site. Asset class exposures for the funds are derived by mapping the fund holdings to their corresponding asset class category. In cases where surveyed funds hold balanced or other multi-asset class funds, S&P Indices look through to the underlying asset allocation of these funds to determine their net effect on the asset allocation of the surveyed fund.
It is not possible to invest directly in indexes which are unmanaged and do not incur fees or charges. Asset classes currently represented in the series are: Large-, mid-, and small-cap US equities; Developed International Equities; Emerging Market Equities; US REITs; Core Fixed Income; Short-Term US Treasuries; TIPS; US High Yield; and Commodities.
Each target date allocation is created and retired according to a pre-determined schedule related to the relevant target date.
The Statistics presented are defined as follows. Standard Deviation measures the average deviations of a return series from its mean, and is often used as a measure of risk. Downside Risk is calculated in the same manner as Standard Deviation, but only those observations below the mean are used in the calculation. Beta is a measure of systematic risk, or the sensitivity of a manager to movements in the benchmark. A beta of 1 implies that you can expect the movement of a manager’s return series to match that of the benchmark used to measure beta. Maximum Drawdown measures the largest percentage decline from a peak to a trough.
The cumulative effect of fees and expenses can substantially reduce the growth of your retirement savings. Visit the Department of Labor’s Web site for an example showing the long-term effect of fees and expenses at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/publications/401k employee.html. Fees and expenses are only one of the many factors to consider when you decide to invest in an option. You may also want to think about whether an investment in a particular option, along with your other investments, will help you achieve your financial goals. Past Performance is no guarantee of future results. Investments are subject to risk, and any of Stadion's investment strategies may lose money.

Strategies with a defensive bias.
Stadion’s approach is simple but powerful: Over time, our goal is to capture most of the market's good times and miss most of its bad times. We believe that missing severe market drops is essential to investment success, because the less investors lose during downturns, the less they have to make up before their gains become true gains during a rebound. Making money is important, but protecting that money can be just as important.
We believe our active management strategies set us apart from many investment managers who employ buy-and-hold methodologies. We don't pretend to predict the market—that would be foolish. Rather, our proprietary processes are based on math and discipline. Our data-driven models recommend investment changes based on market conditions, and our money managers make changes to the Stadion portfolios and funds based solely on these indicators.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
