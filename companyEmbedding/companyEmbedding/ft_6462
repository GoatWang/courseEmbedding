            Chateau Beaujolais Description - 4429
          

Imagine driving up to the gates which welcome you to this magnificent home! Reminiscent of classic French Chateau architecture, everything about this house exclaims opulence and understated elegance.The raised main entry brings you to a solid oversized main door with sidelights framed by niches.  The marble floored vestibule offers grand vistas throughout this home.To the left is a the beamed ceiling library with fireplace and built in book cases.  The grand staircase ascends to the second floor while a few steps lead to the formal reception and dinging halls framed by 12 high columns and coffered ceilings.  While the reception hall affords limitless views of the gardens beyond, the dining hall exudes warmth with lighted floating ceiling, and fireplace.  Note the sunken powder room just off the grand foyer, replete with barreled ceiling and many niches.The master suite is entered through its own foyer, and enjoys lavish spaces and views, as does the grand bath.  Every amenity is enjoyed especially the mini laundry area in the toilet chamber.  The informal area of this estate is truly impressive with the kitchen serving as the heart of the home.  It accesses the formal dining hall through a dual use butlers pantry which has a motorized screen which when opened becomes a bar pass thru to the formal reception all.A secondary staircase just off the pantry and laundry room leads to the second floor with lavishly appointed bedrooms, home theater and connecting tunnel which leads to an additional bedroom suite over the garage wing.  Below this suite is an additional suite with private entry, perfect for visitors.A four car motor court provides security and privacy, and offers children a safe area for play. The pool has a beach design for wading, and a cabana houses kitchen and dressing bath area.Note the balcony in the home theater which views the family gathering hall below.  Wet bar off game area off home theater.Lighted rotunda at main stair.Sunset Balcony off game area.Hidden cabinet faced door to laundry/pantry, so when closed, access to those areas remains hidden.Laundry chute from second floor to laundry room.Herb garden just off kitchen, viewed through counter high glass.
