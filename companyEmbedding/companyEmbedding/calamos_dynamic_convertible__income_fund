CEF Market and Fund Update – May 2017











Calamos CEFs Price and NAV Returns Exceed Relative Index Returns Through May 2017

            May, 2017
            Our SVP, Director of Closed-End Fund Products Robert F. Bush, Jr. provides an May 2017 update on the closed-end fund market. He discusses how the CEF market continues to offer solutions to challenges of income and diversification, while providing investment opportunities.




OVERVIEW

The fund can invest in convertibles and other fixed income securities with the aim of generating a high level of total return through a combination of capital appreciation and income. To help generate income and attempt to achieve a more favorable reward/risk profile, the fund’s investment team also has the flexibility to sell options.













CCD Fact Sheet
A discussion of the Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund performance, related market commentary, and outlook.




KEY FEATURES

Aims to provide consistent monthly income with monthly distributions that are set at levels the investment team believes are sustainable for the long term
Leverages more than 40 years of research in convertible security investing
Seeks to provide upside participation in equity markets with less exposure to downside than an equity-only portfolio over a full market cycle
A term limit provision, a feature not commonly seen in the closed-end fund arena** 
An investment advisor share purchase program  after expiration of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares***





** Term limit will allow shareholders to elect collectively whether or not to liquidate the fund on its 15th anniversary in 2030. 
*** Under this program, Calamos Advisors LLC and/or its affiliates have committed to purchase up to $20 million worth of common shares of CCD under certain predetermined criteria for a limited period following CCD’s IPO.  




PORTFOLIO FIT
With the potential to help manage risk in a portfolio, the fund offers an income-generating allocation that may participate in upside equity movements with limited downside exposure.


WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE, CONVERTIBLES HISTORICALLY PERFORM WELL
In the past 20 years when the 10-year Treasury yield rose more than 100 basis points, convertibles:

Outperformed traditional fixed income asset classes
Tended to deliver equity-like returns with periods of notable outperformance



Source: Morningstar Direct and Bloomberg. Data as of 1/31/17. Rising rate environment periods from troughs to peak from October 1993 to
December 2016. Indexes are unmanaged, do not reflect the deduction of fees and expenses, and are not available for direct investment. The

Important Fund Information


Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annualized percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary. 


You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.


Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. Fixed income securities are subject to interest-rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline. There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest—and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Investment Adviser Repurchase Risk. The Adviser will enter into the 10b5-1 Plan on behalf of itself and its affiliates under which Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as agent for the Adviser, will buy up to $20 million of our common shares in the aggregate during the period beginning after 45 days after the closing of this offering and ending conditions and daily purchase limits. See “Management of the Fund — Related-Party Transactions” in the Fund’s preliminary prospectus for additional details regarding the 10b5-1 Plan. Whether purchases will be made under the 10b5-1 Plan and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. These activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our common shares or suppressing a decline in the market price of the common shares, and, as a result, the price of our common shares may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. Conversely, any eventual sale of repurchased shares by the Adviser or its affiliates may act as a catalyst for a decline in the Fund’s market price, and therefore the market price of our common shares may be lower than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. 

Limited Term Risk. Unless the Termination Date is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, the Fund will be terminated on the 15th anniversary of its effective date, currently expected to be March 26th, 2030. If the Fund’s Board of Trustees believes that under then current market conditions it is in the best interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may extend the Termination Date for one year, which is anticipated to be March 26th, 2031, without a shareholder vote, upon the affirmative vote of three-quarters of the Trustees then in office. Beginning one year before the Termination Date (the “wind-down period”), the Fund may begin liquidating all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio. During the wind-down period the Fund may deviate from its investment strategy. As a result, during the wind-down period the Fund’s distributions may decrease, and such distributions may include a return of capital.

Legal Proceedings Risk. Calamos has been named as a defendant in a Section 36(b) complaint captioned Chill v. Calamos Advisors LLC, et al., which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 11, 2015 (the “Complaint”). The Defendants believe that the Complaint is without merit, and intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations. Calamos also believes that the Complaint will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of Calamos to perform its obligations under its investment management agreement with the Fund.

For final tax characterization of distributions click here.

Ordinary income includes net investment income and short-term capital gains. The distribution tables provided here are for informational purposes only. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions may be subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. Individual (non-corporate) shareholders with taxable accounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions via Form 1099-DIV. If your distributions are reinvested in additional shares, you will receive a statement reflecting the reinvestment of the distribution. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters.









Important Fund Information


Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annualized percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary. 


You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.


Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. Fixed income securities are subject to interest-rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline. There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest—and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Investment Adviser Repurchase Risk. The Adviser will enter into the 10b5-1 Plan on behalf of itself and its affiliates under which Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as agent for the Adviser, will buy up to $20 million of our common shares in the aggregate during the period beginning after 45 days after the closing of this offering and ending conditions and daily purchase limits. See “Management of the Fund — Related-Party Transactions” in the Fund’s preliminary prospectus for additional details regarding the 10b5-1 Plan. Whether purchases will be made under the 10b5-1 Plan and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. These activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our common shares or suppressing a decline in the market price of the common shares, and, as a result, the price of our common shares may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. Conversely, any eventual sale of repurchased shares by the Adviser or its affiliates may act as a catalyst for a decline in the Fund’s market price, and therefore the market price of our common shares may be lower than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. 

Limited Term Risk. Unless the Termination Date is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, the Fund will be terminated on the 15th anniversary of its effective date, currently expected to be March 26th, 2030. If the Fund’s Board of Trustees believes that under then current market conditions it is in the best interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may extend the Termination Date for one year, which is anticipated to be March 26th, 2031, without a shareholder vote, upon the affirmative vote of three-quarters of the Trustees then in office. Beginning one year before the Termination Date (the “wind-down period”), the Fund may begin liquidating all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio. During the wind-down period the Fund may deviate from its investment strategy. As a result, during the wind-down period the Fund’s distributions may decrease, and such distributions may include a return of capital.

Legal Proceedings Risk. Calamos has been named as a defendant in a Section 36(b) complaint captioned Chill v. Calamos Advisors LLC, et al., which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 11, 2015 (the “Complaint”). The Defendants believe that the Complaint is without merit, and intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations. Calamos also believes that the Complaint will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of Calamos to perform its obligations under its investment management agreement with the Fund.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

The use of swap transactions involves investments techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions. If Calamos is incorrect in its forecasts of market values, interest rates, and other applicable factors, the investment performance of the Fund will be less favorable than if those techniques had not been used. Those instruments are typically not traded on exchanges. Accordingly, there is risk that the other party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to the Fund or that the Fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so. Such occurrences could result in losses to the Fund.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Sectors, Securities, and Countries mentioned are presented to illustrate sectors in which the fund may invest. Portfolio holdings are subject to change daily.







Important Fund Information


Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annualized percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary. 


You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.


Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. Fixed income securities are subject to interest-rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline. There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest—and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Investment Adviser Repurchase Risk. The Adviser will enter into the 10b5-1 Plan on behalf of itself and its affiliates under which Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as agent for the Adviser, will buy up to $20 million of our common shares in the aggregate during the period beginning after 45 days after the closing of this offering and ending conditions and daily purchase limits. See “Management of the Fund — Related-Party Transactions” in the Fund’s preliminary prospectus for additional details regarding the 10b5-1 Plan. Whether purchases will be made under the 10b5-1 Plan and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. These activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our common shares or suppressing a decline in the market price of the common shares, and, as a result, the price of our common shares may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. Conversely, any eventual sale of repurchased shares by the Adviser or its affiliates may act as a catalyst for a decline in the Fund’s market price, and therefore the market price of our common shares may be lower than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. 

Limited Term Risk. Unless the Termination Date is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, the Fund will be terminated on the 15th anniversary of its effective date, currently expected to be March 26th, 2030. If the Fund’s Board of Trustees believes that under then current market conditions it is in the best interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may extend the Termination Date for one year, which is anticipated to be March 26th, 2031, without a shareholder vote, upon the affirmative vote of three-quarters of the Trustees then in office. Beginning one year before the Termination Date (the “wind-down period”), the Fund may begin liquidating all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio. During the wind-down period the Fund may deviate from its investment strategy. As a result, during the wind-down period the Fund’s distributions may decrease, and such distributions may include a return of capital.

Legal Proceedings Risk. Calamos has been named as a defendant in a Section 36(b) complaint captioned Chill v. Calamos Advisors LLC, et al., which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 11, 2015 (the “Complaint”). The Defendants believe that the Complaint is without merit, and intend to defend themselves vigorously against the allegations. Calamos also believes that the Complaint will not have a material adverse effect on the ability of Calamos to perform its obligations under its investment management agreement with the Fund.

Important Fund Information


Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annualized percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary. 


You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.


Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment. Fixed income securities are subject to interest-rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline. There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest—and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.

Investment Adviser Repurchase Risk. The Adviser will enter into the 10b5-1 Plan on behalf of itself and its affiliates under which Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as agent for the Adviser, will buy up to $20 million of our common shares in the aggregate during the period beginning after 45 days after the closing of this offering and ending conditions and daily purchase limits. See “Management of the Fund — Related-Party Transactions” in the Fund’s preliminary prospectus for additional details regarding the 10b5-1 Plan. Whether purchases will be made under the 10b5-1 Plan and how much will be purchased at any time is uncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. These activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our common shares or suppressing a decline in the market price of the common shares, and, as a result, the price of our common shares may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. Conversely, any eventual sale of repurchased shares by the Adviser or its affiliates may act as a catalyst for a decline in the Fund’s market price, and therefore the market price of our common shares may be lower than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. 

Limited Term Risk. Unless the Termination Date is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, the Fund will be terminated on the 15th anniversary of its effective date, currently expected to be March 26th, 2030. If the Fund’s Board of Trustees believes that under then current market conditions it is in the best interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may extend the Termination Date for one year, which is anticipated to be March 26th, 2031, without a shareholder vote, upon the affirmative vote of three-quarters of the Trustees then in office. Beginning one year before the Termination Date (the “wind-down period”), the Fund may begin liquidating all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio. During the wind-down period the Fund may deviate from its investment strategy. As a result, during the wind-down period the Fund’s distributions may decrease, and such distributions may include a return of capital.

Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annual percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. The Fund’s most recent distribution was $0.0700 per share. A breakdown of the Fund’s most recent distribution can be found on the Global Dynamic Income Fund Fact Sheet. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.
    
Debt Coverage Ratio is the amount of cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt. A Debt Coverage Ratio of less than 1 would mean a negative cash flow. For example, a ratio of 0.95 would mean that there was only enough net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments.
    
Past Performance
    Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
    
Important Fund Information

    The Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.
    
    There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest, and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.
    
    Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.
    
    Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline.
    
    The Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options. The use of derivatives present risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised.
    
    The Fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure. However, the effectiveness of the Fund’s index option-based risk management strategy may be reduced if the Fund’s equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions. The Fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options. Unusual market conditions or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s options strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s options strategies may not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. From time to time, the Fund may reduce its holdings of put options, resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline.
    
    The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the Fund.
    
    Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.
    
    Each fund has specific risks, which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses. The general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk, dividend and income risk, and loss of investment risk. Please refer to each fund’s prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports at www.calamos.com for complete information on the fund’s performance, investments and risks.

Prior Year Distribution Detail

For final tax characterization of distributions click here.

Ordinary income includes net investment income and short-term capital gains. The distribution tables provided here are for informational purposes only. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions may be subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. Individual (non-corporate) shareholders with taxable accounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions via Form 1099-DIV. If your distributions are reinvested in additional shares, you will receive a statement reflecting the reinvestment of the distribution. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters.







USING A LEVEL DISTRIBUTION POLICY TO PROMOTE TOTAL RETURN
We understand the importance that investors place on the stability of dividends along with long-term total return, which is why CHW adopted a level rate distribution policy. 
The goal is to provide investors with long-term total return, based on our belief that closed-end fund investors consider consistent, dependable distributions to be an important component of total-return.
As a reminder, shareholders can accumulate more shares via the dividend reinvestment plan whether the Fund trades at a premium or discount. If the Fund is trading at a premium, the dividend is reinvested at NAV or at 95% of the market price, whichever is greater. If the Fund is trading at a discount, the dividend is reinvested at the market price.

    The Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options. The use of derivatives present risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised.
    
    The Fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure. However, the effectiveness of the Fund’s index option-based risk management strategy may be reduced if the Fund’s equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions. The Fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options. Unusual market conditions or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s options strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s options strategies may not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. From time to time, the Fund may reduce its holdings of put options, resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline.
    
    The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the Fund.
    
    Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.
    
    Each fund has specific risks, which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses. The general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk, dividend and income risk, and loss of investment risk. Please refer to each fund’s prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports at www.calamos.com for complete information on the fund’s performance, investments and risks.

Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in dividend rates on any preferred shares.

The use of swap transactions involves investments techniques and risks that are different from those associated with portfolio security transactions. If Calamos is incorrect in its forecasts of market values, interest rates, and other applicable factors, the investment performance of the Fund will be less favorable than if those techniques had not been used. Those instruments are typically not traded on exchanges. Accordingly, there is risk that the other party to certain of these instruments will not perform its obligations to the Fund or that the Fund may be unable to enter into offsetting positions to terminate its exposure or liquidate its position under certain of these instruments when it wishes to do so. Such occurrences could result in losses to the Fund.

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.

Sectors, Securities, and Countries mentioned are presented to illustrate sectors in which the fund may invest. Portfolio holdings are subject to change daily.






Current Annualized Distribution Rate is the Fund’s most recent distribution, expressed as an annual percentage of the Fund’s current market price per share. The Fund’s most recent distribution was $0.0700 per share. A breakdown of the Fund’s most recent distribution can be found on the Global Dynamic Income Fund Fact Sheet. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis rather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions are subject to re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters. Under the Fund’s level rate distribution policy, distributions paid to common shareholders may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and return of capital. When the net investment income and net realized short-term capital gains are not sufficient, a portion of the level rate distribution will be a return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include net realized long-term capital gains. Distribution rate may vary.
    
Debt Coverage Ratio is the amount of cash flow available to meet annual interest and principal payments on debt. A Debt Coverage Ratio of less than 1 would mean a negative cash flow. For example, a ratio of 0.95 would mean that there was only enough net operating income to cover 95% of annual debt payments.
    
Past Performance
    Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, market price will fluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value.
    
Important Fund Information

    The Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market-cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.
    
    There are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest, and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase.
    
    Investments by the Fund in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.

Unusual market conditions or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the Fund’s options strategies, and for these and other reasons the Fund’s options strategies may not reduce the Fund’s volatility to the extent desired. From time to time, the Fund may reduce its holdings of put options, resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline.
    
    The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the Fund.
    
    Leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.
    
    Each fund has specific risks, which are outlined in the respective funds’ prospectuses. The general risks involved in investing in a closed end fund include market volatility risk, dividend and income risk, and loss of investment risk. Please refer to each fund’s prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports at www.calamos.com for complete information on the fund’s performance, investments and risks.

Calamos Dynamic Convertible And Income Fund: Setting Up For A Fall? - Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund (NASDAQ:CCD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Calamos Dynamic Convertible And Income Fund: Setting Up For A Fall?Apr.28.15 | About: Calamos Dynamic (CCD) Reuben Gregg Brewer Dividend investing, special situations, contrarian, REITsSummaryCCD is a new closed-end fund offered by Calamos.It's more focused on convertible securities than its siblings.But it also trades at the highest premium.Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund (NASDAQ:CCD) recently held its initial public offering. At the moment, it's trading at a premium of around 5.7%. That's well beyond the discounts most of its siblings change hands at. Investors should be prepared for a price decline.
Happy birthday
CCD IPOed on March 30th at a price of $25 per share. The only thing is that CCD is a closed-end fund, which means that the $25 IPO price includes a sales commission. The net asset value, or NAV, at the time of the IPO was just $23.83. Essentially, anyone who bought at the IPO price overpaid by roughly 4.9%, which is why investors should avoid closed-end fund, or CEF, IPOs. CEF IPOs are, generally speaking, sold product, meaning that brokers push them to customers because people aren't looking to buy on their own - and the brokers get compensated accordingly.
So far, the NAV has risen to $24.17, which is a good thing, though buyers at $25 would still be under water if the price fell to the NAV. That said, the market price has also increased, going up to $25.55, meaning the current premium of 5.7% is actually higher than the premium when the CEF IPOed. And while right now, anyone who bought at the IPO can feel reasonably good about the investment, that's not likely to last for very long.
Convertible specialist
Calamos is a convertible specialist and CCD is focused more heavily on convertibles than its sibling CEFs. In fact, the goal is to have roughly 80% of its assets in convertible securities (that can go as low as 50% depending on market conditions). The rest is largely invested in high-yield bonds. That's a space in which most of the company's other CEFs invest, so Calamos is well versed in that bond arena, too. The fund can also leverage up to a third of its assets, though the expectation is that leverage will be under 30% for now. Its other funds tend to make sure of leverage, as well.

Essentially, CCD invests in areas and ways in which Calamos has plenty of experience. The part that differentiates it from the other Calamos offerings is the heavy focus on converts - the fund family's specialty.
That said, CCD also has an interesting "term limit" provision. According to Calamos:
[The] Term limit will allow shareholders to elect collectively whether or not to liquidate the fund on its 15th anniversary in 2030.
In theory that should allow the fund to track more closely to NAV than other funds. In reality, however, I wouldn't expect it to be a material price driver for another 14 years or so. Until that point, CCD is just another closed-end fund, with a market price driven by investor supply and demand.
All in the family
The thing is, CCD is one of only two Calamos CEFs trading at a premium right now. And the premium of sibling Convertible&High Income Fund (NASDAQ:CHY) is half that of CCD. Note that CHY's convertible exposure is roughly 55%, with high-yield bonds accounting for the vast majority of the nearly 40% of assets in traditional bonds. It is probably the most similar product offering to CCD in the Calamos family.
With that as a guide, though, why is CCD trading at twice the premium? As an investor, you shouldn't be surprised to see CCD's premium narrow at least a few percentage points. Only a premium isn't the norm for CHY.
According to the Closed-End Fund Association, CHY has traded at an average discount of around 2.5% over the past five years. It's traded at a slight discount on average over the trailing decade. So while investors are paying more than NAV for CHY today, that hasn't historically been the case. So, it isn't unreasonable to expect CCD's premium to fall to NAV or lower, based on a comparison to CHY.
Although a stagnant market price and rising NAV could accomplish that, it's more likely that the market price will decline toward NAV. Using today's pricing, trading at NAV would mean a share price decline of around 5.5%. That would leave those that invested in the IPO under water by a little over 3%.

But the story gets worse. All of the other closed-end funds in the Calamos family trade at discounts, reaching as high as 9% for Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund (NASDAQ:CHW). CHW's five-year average discount is roughly 10%, so 9% isn't an abnormally large discount. To be fair, Global Dynamic Income Fund is a very different animal than CCD, with only about 25% of assets in convertibles. The rest is largely stocks (50% of assets) and high yield bonds (about 20%). So it probably isn't reasonable to expect CCD to fall to that wide of a discount, at least not in the near term, absent some noteworthy catalyst.
All downhill from here
At the end of the day, however, IPO investors in CCD overpaid for the fund. That's how CEF IPOs work. Although both the NAV and market price have gone up since the IPO, there's a pretty high likelihood that the premium won't remain as high as it is currently. In fact, it's completely reasonable to expect the premium to go away entirely based on similar funds offered by the same family. With little performance record to go on and a premium price, it's probably best that investors avoid CCD. And if you bought at the IPO, you might want to cash in now before it's too late.

Nasdaq tower announces the IPO of CCD
 


 

 




 





 


NAPERVILLE, Ill., March 27, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Calamos Investments, a pioneer in convertible securities investing since the 1970s, today announced the completion of pricing for the initial public offering of the Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund (NASDAQ:   CCD). The new closed-end fund raised $555 million (or 22,200,000 common shares at a price of $25.00 per share) in its common share offering, excluding any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional common shares. If the underwriters exercise that option in full, the fund will have raised approximately $638.25 million. Assuming the use of leverage of approximately 28% of the fund's managed assets, it is anticipated that the fund's managed assets will exceed $845 million. The fund is the first closed-end fund IPO since November 2014 and the first such convertible offering since 2007.  The fund will begin trading today on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol CCD.
Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund is designed to offer total return through a combination of capital appreciation and current income by investing primarily in a portfolio of convertible and income producing securities, including high yield bonds. To help generate income and attempt to achieve a more favorable reward/risk profile, the fund has the flexibility to opportunistically write options on a portion of the portfolio's securities.
The fund includes a term limit provision, a feature not commonly seen in the closed-end fund arena, which provides that the fund will terminate on its 15th anniversary in 2030, unless the term is extended by the fund's board of trustees for up to one year or shareholders elect to eliminate or extend the term.
Also, Calamos Investments is pleased to announce an investment advisor share purchase program after expiration of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares. Under this program, Calamos Advisors LLC and/or its affiliates have committed to purchase up to $20 million worth of common shares of CCD under certain predetermined criteria for a limited period following CCD's IPO.  
"With the launch of CCD, Calamos Investments continues its legacy of innovation and shareholder focus within the closed-end fund marketplace. We are pleased to offer investors a product that draws upon the firm's nearly four-decades of leadership in convertible securities in a way that is both innovative and timely," says John P. Calamos, Sr., CEO and Global Co-CIO of Calamos Investments.
The fund plans to pay its first monthly distribution 60-90 days after its IPO date and will seek to provide predictable, monthly distributions through the implementation of a level distribution policy. 
Calamos Advisors LLC, a subsidiary of Calamos Investments, is the fund's advisor and oversees a range of investment strategies. The lead managers of the underwriting syndicate were Wells Fargo Securities, Ameriprise Financial Services, BofA Merrill Lynch and RBC Capital Markets.
Calamos Investments also manages five other closed-end funds, exceeding more than $6.2 billion in total AUM.

Important Risk Information
The fund is a newly organized, diversified, closed-end management investment company designed primarily as a long-term investment and not as a trading tool. The fund invests in a globally diversified portfolio of convertible securities, debt and equity income-producing securities as well as other investments that generate current income and dividends. An investment in the fund's common shares may be speculative and it involves a high degree of risk. The fund should not constitute a complete investment program. Due to the uncertainty in all investments, there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective.
The goal of the level-rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash flow. Monthly distributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains and, if necessary, return of capital. Maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the fund.
Before investing carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Please see the prospectus containing this and other information or call 1.800.582.6959. Read it carefully before investing. 
A registration statement relating to the fund's common shares has been filed with, and declared effective by, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

Nasdaq

Nuveen Nasdaq 100 DynamicOverwrite Fund (QQQX)


DJIA

Nuveen Dow 30SM DynamicOverwrite Fund (DIAX)



What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
