Title: Lumber Yard Customer Service
               Company: tw Perry
Job Details
               TW Perry was founded in 1911 by Thomas W. Perry and his family just outside of Washington, DC, at a time when today's bustling suburbs were rural outposts of the city. The company sold coal, animal feed and later heating oil. In the 1950s and 1960s, as demand for housing in the DC area began to increase, TW Perry expanded its business to include building materials. The company later added a second location in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where TW Perry established the first "home center" in the area, serving both contractors and homeowners. In the mid-1990s, partly in response to new, intense competition from "big box" retailers, Tom Perry, Jr. brought in an outside consulting firm to reposition the company to better serve the professional contractor. The company focused its resources and capital to satisfy the specific needs of homebuilders and remodelers. In 1999, a group of senior management personnel purchased the company from the Perry family and has continued to produce a steady rate of growth.  Today, with nearly $150 million in annual sales, TW Perry ranks #47 among the nation's lumber and building materials suppliers and #19 among the nation's fastest-growing suppliers.* As of 2006 the company operated five lumberyards - three in Maryland and two in Virginia - and, through its Classic Moulding & Door division, a fifth facility specializing in the design, fabrication and customization of mouldings and doors. TW Perry continues to grow while maintaining a commitment to high-quality products and service.
