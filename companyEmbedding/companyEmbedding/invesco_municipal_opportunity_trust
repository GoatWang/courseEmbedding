Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities Trust

Rai Favela |
Viernes, Julio 28, 2017







Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust (NYSE:VCV) institutional sentiment increased to 3.71 in 2016 Q4.Parabolic SAR (or PSAR) is a simple, compact indicator that can provide some useful information when taking into account additional trends and factors. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. The stock's 50-day moving average is $7.85 and its 200 day moving average is $7.70. The 50 day moving average moved up $0.05 whereas the 200 day moving average was up $0.22 or +2.8347%. The stock had a trading volume of 91,945 shares.
SAR stands for stop and reverse and it is a trend following indicator, created to identify the turning point in price action. The moving average can be used as a reference point to assist with the discovery of buying and selling opportunities.Invesco Van Kampen California Value Municipal Income Trust, formerly Invesco California Value Municipal Income Trust, is a diversified, closed-end management investment trust. A reading from -80 to -100 would indicate an oversold situation. Presently, Yanlord Land Group Ltd (Z25.SI)'s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -42.86. An oscillator is an indicator that is used as a counter trend showing when the market is overbought or oversold. Invesco Municipal Income Opportunities Trust was formed on September 19, 1988 and is domiciled in the United States. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend.One of the basic tenets put forth by Charles Dow in the Dow Theory is that security prices do trend. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. Accern also assigned press coverage about the investment management company an impact score of 0 out of 100, indicating that recent media coverage is extremely unlikely to have an impact on the stock's share price in the near term. This represents a $0.76 dividend on an annualized basis and a yield of 5.64%. The Williams %R oscillates in a range from 0 to -100. The goal is to analyze the current trend using trendlines and then either invest with the current trend until the trendline is broken, or wait for the trendline to be broken and then invest with the new (opposite) trend.Another technical indicator that may be a powerful resource for determining trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular momentum indicator used for technical analysis. The RSI oscillates on a scale from 0 to 100. A reading over 70 would indicate that the stock is overbought, and possibly overvalued.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

 Risk & Other Considerations
			 


				Fund characteristics are subject to change daily. Provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the securities mentioned or securities in the sectors shown above. Credit quality and credit allocation are shown as a percentage of total net assets. Sectors are shown as a percentage of long-term investments. Securities are classified by sectors that represent broad groupings of related industries. Credit quality allocations based upon ratings as issued by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, respectively.

This data is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended for trading or selling purposes. Closed end funds, unlike open end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed end funds are sold in the open market.

There is no assurance that a closed end fund will achieve its investment objective. Like any stock, a closed end fund's share price will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors. At the time of sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value, and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Accordingly, it is possible to lose money investing in the Trust.

These funds are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Investments in securities rated below investment grade present greater risk of loss to principal and interest than investment in higher-quality securities. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall. Should the funds employ leverage, the portfolios may experience increased volatility.

Clsd-End Strgy: Master Muni Income - National (CSNA0173)
	
	




Objective
The Portfolio seeks to provide current income exempt from federal income tax and the potential for capital appreciation. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closed-end investment companies (known as "closed-end funds"). These closed-end funds generally seek to invest in federal tax-exempt municipal bonds. Income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax and state and local taxes.


1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). In addition, certain distributions paid by certain funds may be subject to federal, state and local taxes. Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. You should consult your tax adviser for further information on tax implications.
The value of fixed income securities in the closed-end funds will generally fall if interest rates rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
The financial condition of an issuer may
worsen or its credit ratings may drop,
resulting in a reduction in the value of
your Units. This may occur at any point in
time, including during the initial offering period.
The Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. Shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of the shares may decrease. Closed-end funds are subject to risks related to factors such as management's ability to achieve a fund's objective, market conditions affecting a fund's investments and use of leverage. You will bear not only your share of the Portfolio's expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By investing in other funds, the Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
A security issuer may be unable to make payments of interest, dividends or principal in the future. This may reduce the level of dividends a closed-end fund pays which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.
The Portfolio is concentrated in closed-end funds that invest in municipal bonds. Municipal bonds are typically long-term fixed rate debt obligations issued by a municipality or agency thereof, and as a result are generally subject to the various economic, political and other such risks that may affect an issuer. Like other fixed income securities, municipal bonds generally decline in value with increases in interest rates. The market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater liquidity.
Certain of the closed-end funds may invest in high-yield bonds. High-yield bonds are generally below investment grade quality ("junk" bonds). Securities rated "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's or below "Baa3" by Moody's are considered to be below investment grade. Investing in such bonds should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such bonds. Junk bonds are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal. Junk bond prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.
The yield on closed-end funds which invest in bonds will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.
The Portfolio, through its investments in various closed-end funds, may have significant exposure to certain market sectors. Accordingly, the Portfolio may be more susceptible to economic, political and other occurrences influencing those sectors.

This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.

About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Income may be subject to state and local taxes and to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). In addition, certain distributions paid by certain funds may be subject to federal, state and local taxes. Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. You should consult your tax adviser for further information on tax implications.
The value of fixed income securities in the closed-end funds will generally fall if interest rates rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
The financial condition of an issuer may
worsen or its credit ratings may drop,
resulting in a reduction in the value of
your Units. This may occur at any point in
time, including during the initial offering period.
The Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. Shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market and the net asset value of the shares may decrease. Closed-end funds are subject to risks related to factors such as management's ability to achieve a fund's objective, market conditions affecting a fund's investments and use of leverage. You will bear not only your share of the Portfolio's expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By investing in other funds, the Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the funds.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
A security issuer may be unable to make payments of interest, dividends or principal in the future. This may reduce the level of dividends a closed-end fund pays which would reduce your income and cause the value of your units to fall.
The Portfolio is concentrated in closed-end funds that invest in municipal bonds. Municipal bonds are typically long-term fixed rate debt obligations issued by a municipality or agency thereof, and as a result are generally subject to the various economic, political and other such risks that may affect an issuer. Like other fixed income securities, municipal bonds generally decline in value with increases in interest rates. The market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater liquidity.
Certain of the closed-end funds may invest in high-yield bonds. High-yield bonds are generally below investment grade quality ("junk" bonds). Securities rated "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's or below "Baa3" by Moody's are considered to be below investment grade. Investing in such bonds should be viewed as speculative and you should review your ability to assume the risks associated with investments which utilize such bonds. Junk bonds are subject to numerous risks including higher interest rates, economic recession, deterioration of the junk bond market, possible downgrades and defaults of interest and/or principal. Junk bond prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated bonds and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater degree.
The yield on closed-end funds which invest in bonds will generally decline in a falling interest rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.
The Portfolio, through its investments in various closed-end funds, may have significant exposure to certain market sectors. Accordingly, the Portfolio may be more susceptible to economic, political and other occurrences influencing those sectors.
