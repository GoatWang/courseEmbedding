Robert McCabe Jr., a Kidney Donation Specialist, Dies at 88

By WILLIAM YARDLEYSEPT. 22, 2013

The clock was ticking. The kidneys of a 14-year-old girl who had died in a Virginia hospital had been removed from her body with her parents’ consent, in the hope that the organs might extend the life of others. But with only a rudimentary computer network available to help them in 1979, officials at the hospital, Norfolk General, could not find a suitable recipient for one of the kidneys, and they knew they had only 72 hours, at most, to do so.So they reached out to St. Luke’s Hospital Center in New York, where Dr. Robert E. McCabe Jr., an early specialist in kidney transplantation, was head of the renal preservation laboratory. He began scouring the New York area for potential recipients but found none. Nationally, not a single compatible recipient could be found among 6,000 or so people awaiting a transplant. He called colleagues in Italy and Kuwait. No luck.Then, cutting through the cold war tensions of the time, he called the Soviet Embassy in Washington and told them to relay a message to Dr. Valery I. Shumakov, a prominent transplant surgeon he had met that April: a kidney was on the way — please find it a home.The girl, who had suffered head trauma in a traffic accident, had died shortly after noon on a Tuesday in June. The next day, working with the embassy, St. Luke’s put the kidney on a Soviet Aeroflot flight to Moscow out of Kennedy International Airport (after fending off security officials who wanted to check the storage container for explosives). The kidney arrived safely, and Dr. Shumakov soon reported that he had successfully transplanted the organ into a 36-year-old man that Thursday afternoon. (The girl’s other kidney was implanted in a 51-year-old man in Newark.)

In the worlds of medicine and international politics, Dr. McCabe’s determination to link donors with recipients had brought about a rare collaboration with the Soviets. But for Dr. McCabe, who died at 88 on Aug. 29, the episode underscored the shortcomings in the American system of kidney donations. Continue reading the main story

“We should have been able to use those kidneys at home, but we weren’t organized adequately in New York City to use them all locally, or in the States themselves,” he said in a recent interview on the Web site of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, of which he was a founding member. “We shouldn’t have had to go that far.”The first successful kidney transplant was conducted in 1954, and the procedure was rapidly adopted around the world. But by the late 1970s, hospitals faced challenges in preserving an organ during the out-of-body interim and in matching donors with recipients.Dr. McCabe, who performed transplants at St. Luke’s, taught himself to become a specialist in organ preservation using cold storage as well as a machine developed by the transplant surgeon Dr. Folkert O. Belzer. The process, known as machine perfusion, uses a blend of fluids to simulate a kidney’s natural function until the kidney is transplanted. Dr. McCabe helped refine the blend.

But even with these preservation efforts, a kidney could be kept functional outside the body only for up to 72 hours.The 1979 episode was not the first kidney transplant between the United States and the Soviet Union — there had been at least two others — but it exemplified the improvisational nature of transplant surgery and organ donation at the time.Dr. McCabe’s photograph, showing him helping to push free a police car that had become stuck in the mud while transporting a kidney into Manhattan, had once appeared in The Daily News in New York. On another occasion he delivered a kidney to Italy using a perfusion machine, the fluid inside frothing as the car in which he transported it through Rome bumped along cobblestone streets.

“In those days it was a free-for-all,” said Dr. Thomas G. Peters, a surgeon who is the historian for the transplant society. “This was cowboy time.”But the New York-to-Moscow episode had a positive effect in generating publicity for the transplant program — the account appeared on the front page of The New York Times — and that in turn led to a noticeable rise in kidney donations.

Continue reading the main story

Over time, databases of kidney donors and recipients became more sophisticated, as did preservation methods, enabling transplants to be accomplished far more speedily. In 1984, to prevent entrepreneurs from profiting from transplantation and hospitals from moving wealthy patients to the top of the waiting list, Congress passed the National Organ Transplant Act, which outlawed the sale of organs and established a regulatory framework for donations.Dr. McCabe said that one benefit of tighter regulations was a more efficient process of determining when an organ donor was dead so that the organ could be harvested.“We’d hear about a donor on Tuesday or Wednesday, and we couldn’t get the neurologist to declare brain death,” he said in the online interview. “They were some of the skeptics too, frankly, and they would not declare brain death until Friday afternoon at 5, when they were tired of caring for the patient and wanted us to take over. So we would be busy every weekend.”Robert Emmet McCabe Jr. was born on Feb. 20, 1925, in Charleston, W.Va. His father, Robert, was a lawyer, and his mother, the former Margaret Ward, was a homemaker. He graduated from Williams College in 1948 and received his medical degree in 1953 from Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan. He served as a surgeon in the Army from 1955 to 1957.Dr. McCabe died of cancer at his home in Londonderry, Vt., his family said. Survivors include four daughters, Elsie Smith, Coco McCabe, Rue Sherwood and Kay McCabe; a son, Robert Emmet III; and nine grandchildren. His wife of 58 years, the former Katherine Robinson, died last year.

Robert A. McCabe













                    
                    Robert McCabe was born in Chicago in 1934 and grew up in the New York City area.  His father worked for a picture newspaper in New York, and as the result of the gift of a Kodak Baby Brownie McCabe started taking photographs when he was five. His earliest quest was for newsworthy photographs and he gathered images of hurricanes, drownings, and auto and train accidents. His interests shifted to people, still life, and landscapes during three years in western Massachusetts where little of dramatic interest occurred.  His first photographs of Europe were the result of a trip in 1954 to France, Italy, and Greece while he was an undergraduate at Princeton.  He returned to Greece in 1955 and 1957 via freighter from the U.S. and traveled extensively in the Aegean, shooting with a Rolleiflex and Plus-X film. In 1957 he took a series of color photographs in the Greek Islands at the request of the National Geographic Society. His black and white photos were first exhibited in 1954 and 1955 at Firestone Library at Princeton, and in a traveling exhibition, which ensued. During this period he also appeared on television with Ambassador George Melas giving a photographic tour of Greece.  In 1967 a selection of photographs was exhibited at the Olympic Gallery (now Olympic Tower) in New York under the auspices of Spyros Skouras. The publication of his first book "Metamorphosis" was in 1979.In recent years his images have been displayed at the Art Association in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute in New York; The Hellenic Centre in London; and in Greece at exhibitions in Athens, Salonica, Patras, Santorini, Monodendri, Poros, Corfu, and Anatolia College. In 2008, in the framework of Mois de la Photo, he exhibited a selection of photographs of Greece at Galerie Sit Down in Paris. His bestselling book, "Greece: Images of an Enchanted Land 1954-1965" was published by Quantuck Lane Press in the U.S. and by Patakis Editions in Greece. It is in its fourth printing.  His photos of Greece have also appeared in numerous books by other authors.A trip to Havana, Cuba in 1998 resulted in a book of color photographs, "Weekend in Havana: An American Photographer in the Forbidden City", published in 2007 by Patakis and Abbeville Press. Those images were also the basis for exhibitions in Athens and Salonica. A selection of photographs taken during the 1950s in France, Canada, Italy, Greece, the U.S., and Antarctica entitled, "On the Road with a Rollei in the '50s", was published in the summer of 2007 by Patakis. It coincided with the exhibition held in Monodendri, Greece from August 2007 through July 2008 at the Rizarios Photography Exhibition Center. Another album of his images of Greece was published to coincide with his November 2008 exhibition in Paris. It is entitled "Grèce: les années d'innocence" and was published by Editions Filigranes.  His book of photographs of Antarctica taken in 1959 was published in 2010 under the title "DeepFreeze: A Photographer's Antarctic Odyssey in the Year 1959" to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the attainment of the South Pole.  In April 2011 his book, "The Ramble in Central Park: A Wilderness West of Fifth" was published by Abbeville Press. It was the winner in 2012 of the ForeWord Gold Medal for Best in the Nature category of 2011 books. In October 2012 McCabe published a “China-Greece: Ancient People, Changing Worlds” in conjunction with an exhibition of the same name which is running at the Museum of Asian Art in Corfu Greece through May 2013. The book presents 130 color photographs of these two countries illustrating the rapid changes that have, and are taking place in each.McCabe’s photographs are represented by galleries in the U.S., France, and Greece.
