	Item 1.01



	                                          


	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement




	 




	On October 31, 2016, Archrock Partners, L.P.  (the Partnership or we) entered into a Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement (the Contribution Agreement) with Archrock, Inc. (AROC), Archrock Services, L.P. (OpCo), Archrock Services Leasing LLC (Archrock Leasing), Archrock GP LP LLC (LP LLC), Archrock GP LLC (GP LLC), Archrock MLP LP LLC (MLP LP LLC), Archrock General Partner, L.P. (GP), Archrock Partners Operating LLC (APLP Operating) and Archrock Partners Leasing LLC (APLP Leasing). The Contribution Agreement provides for, among others, the following transactions:




	 




	1.


	                                     

	A series of conveyances, contributions and distributions by OpCo to various parties to the Contribution Agreement and ultimately to APLP Operating and APLP Leasing of specified compression services customer contracts and compression equipment used to provide compression services under those contracts;



	 




	2.


	                                     

	Our issuance to MLP LP LLC of common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (Common Units); and



	 




	3.


	                                     

	Our issuance to GP, our general partner, of general partner units in the Partnership.



	 




	The number of Common Units and general partner units to be issued will be equal to $85 million divided by the volume weighted daily average price of the Partnerships common units for the 30 trading days ending one trading day prior to the closing date, as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.




	 




	These transactions, which are subject to standard closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, are expected to close in November 2016. An additional closing condition requires us and AROC to enter into an amendment to the Fourth Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement, dated as of November 3, 2015 (as so amended, the Omnibus Agreement), by and among us, AROC, OpCo, GP LLC, GP and APLP Operating, regarding several relationships between us and AROC. The Omnibus Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference to Exhibit 10.8 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 29, 2016.  The amendment will, among other things, (1) extend the terms of certain non-competition and equipment transfer provisions for an additional year such that they will now terminate on December 31, 2018 and (2) restate the schedules that identify the customers of AROC and its subsidiaries (other than the Partnership and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and  the Partnership and its subsidiaries, on the other hand.




	 




	The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Contribution Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K and is incorporated in this Item 1.01 by reference.




	 






	Relationships






	 




	Each of the parties to the Contribution Agreement, other than AROC, is a direct or indirect subsidiary of AROC. As a result, certain individuals, including officers and directors of AROC and GP LLC, serve as officers and/or directors of more than one of such entities. Also, AROC holds (as of the date of this Form 8-K and without giving effect to the Common Units to be issued in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement) an indirect 39% limited partner interest in us through its subsidiaries and an approximate 2% general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in us through its indirect ownership of GP, our general partner.






	 









	Item 7.01



	                                          


	Regulation FD Disclosure




	 




	On October 31, 2016, we announced that we had entered into the Contribution Agreement. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.




	 




	The information furnished pursuant to this Item 7.01, including Exhibit 99.1, shall not be deemed to be filed for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, unless specifically identified therein as being incorporated therein by reference.

	Forward-Looking Statements





	 




	Statements about the consummation of any transaction and all other statements other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding our ability to complete the proposed transaction and the expected timing of the closing of the transaction.




	 




	While we believe that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, we caution that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of our business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements are the results of the review of the proposed transaction by regulatory agencies and the failure to satisfy the conditions to the closing of the transaction.




	 




	These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and those set forth from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are currently available at www.archrock.com. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

	INDEMNIFICATION




	 




	7.1


	                              


	Indemnification of the Contributors and Other Parties

	.  Solely for the purpose of indemnification in this

	Section 7.1

	, the representations and warranties of the Recipients in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or Recipient Material Adverse Effect qualifiers.  From and after the Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision in the Omnibus Agreement to the contrary, the Recipients shall indemnify and hold the Contributors and their affiliates (other than GP LLC, GP and the Recipients and their respective



	 



	13













	 




	subsidiaries), equity holders, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and insurers (together with the Contributors, the 

	Contributor Parties

	) harmless from and against any and all damages (including exemplary damages and penalties), losses, deficiencies, costs, expenses, obligations, fines, expenditures, claims and liabilities, including reasonable counsel fees and reasonable expenses of investigation, defending and prosecuting litigation (collectively, the 

	Damages

	), suffered by the Contributor Parties as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of any Recipient in this Agreement, (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant under this Agreement on the part of any Recipient or (c)  the ownership, operation or conduct of the Businesses or the Assets on or after the Closing Date, other than those for which the Recipients may be indemnified by the Contributors hereunder.




	 




	7.2


	                              


	Indemnification of the Recipients and other Parties

	.  Solely for the purpose of indemnification in this

	Section 7.2

	, the representations and warranties of the Contributors in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made without regard to any materiality or Material Adverse Effect qualifiers. From and after the Closing Date, and notwithstanding any provision in the Omnibus Agreement to the contrary, the Contributors shall indemnify and hold GP LLC, GP and the Recipients and their respective subsidiaries, equity holders (other than LP LLC, MLP LP LLC and any of the Contributor Parties), directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives and insurers (together with the Recipients, the 

	Recipient Parties

	) harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered by the Recipient Parties as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach of a representation or warranty of any Contributor in this Agreement, (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant under this Agreement on the part of any Contributor or (c) the ownership, operation or conduct of the Business or the Assets prior to the Closing Date.



	 




	7.3


	                              


	Demands

	.  Each indemnified party agrees that promptly upon its discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such third party actions being collectively referred to herein as the 

	Indemnity Claim

	), with respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing to the indemnifying party, together with a statement of such information respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have.  Such notice shall include a formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement.  The indemnifying party shall not be obligated to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to any Indemnity Claim if the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement to the extent that knowing failure to notify actually results in material prejudice or damage to the indemnifying party.



	 




	7.4


	                              


	Right to Contest and Defend

	.  The indemnifying party shall be entitled at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate legal proceedings any Indemnity Claim with respect to which it is called upon to indemnify the indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement;

	provided

	, that notice of the intention to so contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party within 20 days from the date of receipt by the indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the Indemnity Claim.  Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying party or the



	 



	14













	 




	indemnified party as may be appropriate.  Such contest shall be conducted and prosecuted diligently to a final conclusion or settled in accordance with this

	Section 7.4

	by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party and not reasonably objected to by the indemnified party, but the indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its sole cost and expense.  The indemnifying party shall have full authority to determine all action to be taken with respect thereto;

	provided

	, however, that the indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense.  If the indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Indemnity Claim or elects to contest such Indemnity Claim but fails diligently and promptly to prosecute or settle such claim, the indemnifying party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the indemnified party. If the indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of an Indemnity Claim, the indemnified party shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of an Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Indemnity Claim, which releases the indemnified party completely in connection with such Indemnity Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the indemnified party.




	 




	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Indemnity Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the indemnified party in defending such Indemnity Claim) if the Indemnity Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the indemnified party which the indemnified party reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages.  If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Indemnity Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money damages.




	 




	7.5


	                              


	Cooperation

	.  If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses incurred by it in so cooperating.  At no cost or expense to the indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and its counsel in contesting any Indemnity Claim.



	 




	7.6


	                              


	Right to Participate

	.  The indemnified party agrees to afford the indemnifying party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and to participate in, conferences with all persons, including Governmental Authorities, asserting any Indemnity Claim against the indemnified party or conferences with representatives of or counsel for such persons.



	 




	7.7


	                              


	Payment of Damages

	.  The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, within 10 days as and when reasonably specific bills are received or loss, liability, claim, damage or expense is incurred and reasonable evidence thereof is delivered.  In calculating any amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, the amount shall



	 



	15













	 




	be reduced by all tax benefits and other reimbursements (including, without limitation, insurance proceeds) credited to or received by the other party related to the Damages.

	by either OpCo or APLP in writing without prejudice to other rights and remedies the terminating party or its affiliates may have (provided the terminating party and its affiliates are not otherwise in material default or breach of this Agreement, or have not failed or refused to close without justification hereunder), if the other party or its affiliates shall have (i) materially failed to perform its covenants or agreements contained herein required to be performed on or prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) materially breached any of its representations or warranties contained herein;

	provided

	, however, that in the case of clause (i) or (ii), the defaulting party shall have a period of 30 days following written notice from the non-defaulting party to cure any breach of this Agreement, if the breach is curable;

	Transfer Restrictions

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                

	For a 180-day period beginning on the Closing Date, neither the New Common Units nor any interest therein shall be transferable by MLP LP LLC without the prior written consent of APLP, except for transfers to affiliated entities of the Contributors in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.  APLP shall require (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to APLP) any proposed permitted transferee of any such New Common Units or any interest therein to be acquired from MLP LP LLC to agree to take and hold such New Common Units or any interest therein subject to the provisions and upon the conditions specified in this

	Section 9.1

	. Any transfer of those New Common Units or any interest therein otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the requirements of APLPs Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated July 30, 2015, as may be amended, shall be null and void.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	Notwithstanding

	Section 9.1(a)

	, neither the New Common Units nor any interest therein shall be transferable by MLP LP LLC, except for transfers to affiliated entities of the Contributors, until such time as the GP determines, based on advice of counsel, that each such New Common Unit should have, as a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal income tax characteristics of an Initial Common Unit (as defined in APLPs limited partnership agreement).  In connection with the condition imposed by this

	Section 9.1

	, the GP may take whatever steps are required to provide economic uniformity to such New Common Units, including the application of

	Section 6.2(c)

	 of APLPs limited partnership agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, such determination by the GP may occur at any time following the Closing Date.

	Registration Rights of MLP LP LLC and its Affiliates

	.



	 




	(a)

	Section 9.2

	, any affiliate of MLP LP LLC as of the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later cease to be an affiliate of MLP LP LLC) desires to sell New Common Units and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such holder of New Common Units (the 

	Holder

	) to dispose of the number of New Common Units it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act, then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, APLP shall file with the SEC as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all New Common Units covered by such registration statement have been sold, a registration statement under the Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the number of New Common Units specified by the Holder;

	Section 9.2(b)

	; and

	provided

	further, however, that if the Conflicts Committee determines that the requested registration would be materially detrimental to APLP or the limited partners of APLP (other than OpCo and its subsidiaries) because such registration would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving APLP, (y) require premature disclosure of material information that APLP has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render APLP unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then APLP shall have the right to postpone such requested registration for a period of not more than three months after receipt of the Holders request, such right pursuant to this

	Section 9.2(a)

	 or

	Section 9.2(b)

	 not to be utilized more than twice in any 12-month period.  In connection with any registration pursuant to the first sentence of this

	Section 9.2(a)

	, APLP shall (i) promptly prepare and file (A) such documents as may be necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to such registration under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request;

	provided

	, however, that no such qualification shall be required in any jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, APLP would become subject to general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such registration, and (B) such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the New Common Units subject to such registration on a national securities exchange as the Holder shall reasonably request, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or appropriate to enable the Holder to consummate a public sale of such New Common Units in such states. Except as set forth in

	Section 9.2(d)

	, all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions and excluding the legal fees and other expenses incurred by the Holder) shall be paid by APLP, without reimbursement by the Holder.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	If any Holder holds New Common Units that it desires to sell and Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such Holder to dispose of the number of New Common Units it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without registration under the Securities Act, then at the option and upon the request of the Holder, APLP shall file with the Commission as promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all reasonable efforts to cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months following its effective date or such shorter period as shall terminate when all New Common

	Units covered by a shelf registration statement have been sold, a shelf registration statement covering the New Common Units specified by the Holder on an appropriate form under Rule 415 under the Securities Act, or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission;

	provided

	, however, that APLP shall not be required to effect more than three registrations pursuant to

	Section 9.2(a)

	 and this

	Section 9.2(b)

	; and

	provided

	further, however, that if the Conflicts Committee determines in good faith that any offering under, or the use of any prospectus forming a part of, the shelf registration statement would be materially detrimental to APLP and its Partners because such offering or use would (x) materially interfere with a significant acquisition, reorganization or other similar transaction involving APLP, (y) require premature disclosure of material information that APLP has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential or (z) render APLP unable to comply with requirements under applicable securities laws, then APLP shall have the right to suspend such offering or use for a period of not more than three months after receipt of the Holders request, such right pursuant to

	Section 9.2(a)

	 or this

	Section 9.2(b)

	 not to be utilized more than twice in any 12-month period.




	 




	(c)


	                                 

	Except as provided in the first sentence of each of subsections (a) and (b) of this

	Section 9.2

	, APLP shall be deemed not to have used all reasonable efforts to keep the registration statement effective during the applicable period if it voluntarily takes any action that would result in Holders of New Common Units covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such New Common Units at any time during such period, unless such action is required by applicable law.



	 




	(d)


	                                

	If APLP shall at any time propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of APLP for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee benefit plan), APLP shall use all reasonable efforts to provide the Holders notice of its intention to file such registration statement and shall use all reasonable efforts to include such number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such registration statement as the Holder shall request;

	provided

	, that APLP is not required to make any effort or take any action to so include the securities of the Holder once the registration statement is declared effective by the Commission or otherwise becomes effective, including any registration statement providing for the offering from time to time of securities pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act. If the proposed offering pursuant to this

	Section 9.2(d)

	 shall be an underwritten offering, then, if the managing underwriter or managing underwriters of such offering advise APLP and the Holder in writing that in their opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holders New Common Units would adversely and materially affect the success of the offering, APLP shall include in such offering only that number or amount, if any, of securities held by the Holder that, in the opinion of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, will not adversely and materially affect the offering. All costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions and excluding the legal fees and other expenses incurred by the Holder) shall be paid by APLP, without reimbursement by the Holder.



	 




	(e)


	                                 

	The provisions of

	Section 9.2(a)

	,

	Section 9.2(b)

	 and

	Section 9.2(d)

	 shall continue to be applicable with respect to MLP LP LLC (and any of MLP LP LLCs affiliates) after GP ceases to be a general partner of APLP, during a period of two years subsequent to the effective date of such cessation and for so long thereafter as is required for the Holder to sell all of the New Common Units with respect to which it has requested during such two-year period inclusion in a registration statement otherwise filed or that a registration statement be filed;



	 



	20













	 





	provided


	, however, that APLP shall not be required to file successive registration statements covering the same New Common Units for which registration was demanded during such two-year period. The provisions of

	Section 9.2(d)

	 shall continue in effect thereafter.



	 




	(f)


	                                  

	The rights to cause APLP to register New Common Units pursuant to this

	Section 9.2

	may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a Holder to a transferee or assignee of such New Common Units if (i) APLP is, within a reasonable time after such transfer, furnished with written notice of the name and address of such transferee or assignee and the number of New Common Units with respect to which such registration rights are being assigned and (ii) such transferee or assignee agrees in writing to be bound by and subject to the terms set forth in this

	Section 9.2

	.



	 




	(g)


	                                 

	Any request to register New Common Units pursuant to this

	Section 9.2

	shall (i) specify the New Common Units intended to be offered and sold by the person making the request, (ii) express such persons present intent to offer such New Common Units for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or method of the proposed offer and sale of New Common Units, and (iv) contain the undertaking of such Person to provide all such information and materials and take all action as may be required in order to permit APLP to comply with all applicable requirements in connection with the registration of such New Common Units.



	 




	9.3


	                              


	Expenses

	.  Except as otherwise set forth herein, each party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and all action taken in preparation for effecting the provisions of this Agreement.

	Right of Offset

	.  Each party agrees that, in addition to, and without limitation of, any right of set-off, lien or counterclaim a party may otherwise have, each party shall have the right and be entitled, at its option, to offset (a) balances held by it or by any of its affiliates for account of any other party at any of its offices and (b) other obligations at any time owing by such party in connection with any obligations to or for the credit or account of the other party, against any principal of or interest on any of such other partys indebtedness or any other amount due and payable to such other party hereunder that is not paid when due.

	ARCHROCK PARTNERS TO ACQUIRE






	COMPRESSION ASSETS FROM ARCHROCK, INC.





	 




	HOUSTON, October 31, 2016  Archrock, Inc. (NYSE: AROC) and Archrock Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: APLP) today announced that Archrock Partners has agreed to acquire assets from Archrock, Inc. including customer contracts serving 63 customers together with approximately 270 compressor units used to provide compression services under those contracts, for consideration of approximately $85 million. Those compressor units represent approximately 150,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 4 percent (by available horsepower) of the combined contract operations business of Archrock, Inc. and Archrock Partners.




	 




	The consideration to be paid to Archrock, Inc.s affiliates will consist entirely of newly issued Archrock Partners common units and general partner units. The number of common units to be issued by Archrock Partners will be determined by the daily volume weighted average price of Archrock Partners common units over the thirty trading days preceding the closing date. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the fourth-quarter of 2016.




	 




	In the event the transaction closes prior to the Archrock Partners third quarter 2016 distribution record date, then Archrock, Inc. has agreed to waive receipt of Archrock Partners third quarter 2016 distribution on the limited and general partner units received as consideration in the transaction. Archrock, Inc. will receive the distributions associated with these units beginning with Archrock Partners fourth quarter 2016 distribution, which is expected to be paid in February 2017.




	 




	This transaction expands Archrock Partners fee-based business and enhances its position as the leading provider of natural gas contract operations services in the United States, said Brad Childers, President and Chief Executive Officer of Archrock, Inc. and Archrock Partners. Additionally, the transaction improves Archrock Partners leverage profile, is accretive to unitholders, and increases Archrock, Inc.s equity interest in Archrock Partners.




	 




	The transaction was approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of Archrock Partners managing general partner. The conflicts committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors, retained independent legal and financial advisors to assist it in evaluating the transaction.

	Forward-Looking Statements





	All statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the subjects of this release) other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside Archrocks control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to: statements about the expected completion of the proposed transaction and the timing of closing; the anticipated benefits of the transaction to Archrock, Inc. and Archrock Partners; Archrock, Inc.s and Archrock Partners financial and operational strategies and ability to successfully effect those strategies; Archrock, Inc.s and Archrock Partners financial and operational outlook and ability to fulfill that outlook; the potential direct and indirect impacts of the matters described in Archrocks April 26, 2016 and May 3, 2016 Forms 8-K; and expectations regarding Archrock Partners fourth quarter 2016 distribution.




	 




	While Archrock, Inc. and Archrock Partners each believe that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, they caution that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of their businesses.

Archrock Partners LP Securities Investigation




(Last Updated On: January 18, 2016)Have you suffered losses investing in Archrock Partners LP?   If so, the securities attorneys of The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses in a FINRA arbitration claim against the brokerage firm that recommended the investment.
Archrock Partners, L.P. provides natural gas compression services. The Company offers gas compression services including gas lift and re-injection, processing, turbine fuel boosting and carbon dioxide compression. Archrock Partners serves the oil and natural gas industry throughout the United States.  The company is based in Houston, Texas.  According to Barrons, Wells Fargo analysts that cover master limited partnership sorted through their universe and recently came out with a report that lists the companies most likely to cut their distributions – Archrock Partners was included on that list.
Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), like Archrock Partners LP are a type of limited partnership that is publicly traded. MLP’s receive the same tax benefits of a limited partnership combined with the liquidity of a publically traded security. In order to be classified as an MLP the partnership must receive 90% of its cash flow from a “qualifying source” – such as real estate, natural resources or commodities.
MLPs have increasingly been used to invest in the energy sector and are often sold to investors seeking income.  However, MLP’s are extremely complex and risky, making them only suitable for wealthy, sophisticated retail investors or institutional investors.  They are also a dream product for Wall Street because of the fees they generate, which may cause unscrupulous financial advisors looking to maximize their own commissions to recommend them improperly.
It is for this reason that The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for recommending high risk MLPs, like Archrock Partners LP, to their clients.
Brokerage firms that sell oil and gas MLPs are required to perform adequate due diligence on the investments to ensure a reasonable likelihood of success, and to evaluate whether the investments are suitable in light of the client’s age, net worth, investment experience, and investment objectives. Firms that fail to perform adequate due diligence, or that make unsuitable recommendations, can be held responsible for losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
If you suffered losses investing Archrock Partners LP or another energy MLP and would like to discuss your litigation options, please call The White Law Group at (312)238-9650 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities arbitration, securities fraud, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida.  The firm represents investors throughout the country in FINRA arbitration claims against their brokerage firm.

First
Amendment to Fourth Amended and Restated Omnibus
Agreement

 

In
connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by
the Contribution, Conveyance and Assumption Agreement, dated
October 31, 2016 (the “Contribution Agreement”),
as described in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on
November 3, 2016 by Archrock Partners, L.P. (the
“Partnership” or “we”), on
November 19, 2016, we entered into a First Amendment to Fourth
Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement (the “Omnibus
Amendment”) with Archrock, Inc. (“AROC”),
Archrock Services, L.P. (“OpCo”), Archrock Services
Leasing LLC (“Archrock Leasing”), Archrock GP LP LLC
(“LP LLC”), Archrock GP LLC (“GP LLC”),
Archrock MLP LP LLC (“MLP LP LLC”), Archrock General
Partner, L.P. (“GP”), Archrock Partners Operating LLC
(“APLP Operating”) and Archrock Partners Leasing LLC
(“APLP Leasing”).  The omnibus agreement governs
several relationships between us and AROC, including:

 

1.
             
Certain
agreements not to compete between us and our affiliates, on the one
hand, and AROC and its affiliates, on the other hand;

 

2.
             
AROC’s
obligation to provide all operational staff, corporate staff and
support services reasonably necessary to run our business and our
obligation to reimburse AROC for the provision of such
services;

 

3.
             
The terms
under which we, AROC and our respective affiliates may transfer
compression equipment;

 

4.
             
AROC’s
licensing of certain intellectual property to us, including our and
AROC’s logos; and

 

5.
             
Our
obligation to indemnify AROC for certain liabilities, and
AROC’s obligation to indemnify us for certain
liabilities.

 

The
omnibus agreement is hereby incorporated by reference to
Exhibit 10.8 to our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on
February 29, 2016.

 

The
Omnibus Amendment amends the omnibus agreement to:

 

1.
             
Extend the
terms of certain non-competition and equipment transfer provisions
for an additional year such that they will now terminate on
December 31, 2018; and

 

2.
             
Restate
the schedules that identify the customers of AROC and its
subsidiaries (other the Partnership and its subsidiaries), on the
one hand, and  the Partnership and its subsidiaries, on the
other hand.

 

Each of
the parties to the omnibus agreement, other than AROC, is a direct
or indirect subsidiary of AROC. As a result, certain individuals,
including officers of AROC and officers and directors of GP LLC,
serve as officers and/or directors of more than one of such
entities. Also, AROC holds (as of the date of this Form 8-K,
