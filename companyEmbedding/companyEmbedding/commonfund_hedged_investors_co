Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

About us


Our Mission


Our History












About us
Commonfund is an asset management firm founded in 1971 with a two-part mission. First, to create investment solutions for nonprofits that previously did not have the scale and access to the best managers and strategies. As importantly, our charter was to also create educational programs that would bring current best practices to institutional investors of all sizes and segments. Our insights have helped to advance asset management practices and grow portfolios through ever-changing investment environments. Commonfund too, has changed and grown dramatically over the years–expanding both our investment solution offerings and the client segments we serve. Yet, our mission has remained the same: to enhance the financial resources and improve the investment management practices of our clients.

Commonfund is Proud to be Ranked in the Top Five Most Trusted Institutional Asset Managers for Nonprofits1. 

As of March 31, 2017, Commonfund manages $23.7 billion2 for hundreds of institutions with a focus on two primary activities:


 Outsourced Investment Management


 Alternative Strategies


Our only business is asset management and we are active in all sectors of the global capital markets – in both public and private markets.










Our Mission
Our core mission is to enhance the financial resources of our clients and to help them improve investment management practices. As a private, nonprofit organization, we are beholden to our clients, not to shareholders or outside owners. This enables us to align our interests with those of our clients and lets us focus our undivided attention on institutional asset management.

The Commonfund Difference - Higher Value

How we execute our mission is the key difference that sets us apart, with three mutually supportive components grounded in a strong financial foundation.
Performance Investment programs that seek to generate superior risk-adjusted, long-term investment performance net of fees²
Service Support based on an in-depth understanding of client needs
Insight Knowledge sharing, educational programs and research that promote best practices among institutional investors
Our strong financial resources serve as the underpinning that enables us to implement our mission. It is this strong base that permits us to hire, grow and retain talented people; invest in information technology and other client support assets; and consistently deliver a broad range of educational programs specifically for institutional investors.
 










Our History
The founding of Commonfund is one of the exciting stories of innovation in asset management. To understand why, return to the late 1960s. In this era, investment returns from college endowments persistently lagged the rate of growth in operating budgets. There was increasing concern throughout higher education regarding the future vitality of these institutions. And, many institutions faced problems of faculty compensation and deferred maintenance. Traditional endowment management as practiced at the time hampered trustees’ ability to address these issues.

But change was in the air. Thought leaders of the day were looking at the then-new concept of total return and thinking about allowing colleges to set their own spending rate. One study, Managing Educational Endowments, concluded that poor results were due to an over-emphasis on avoiding losses and maximizing current income. The Ford Foundation sponsored a landmark study, The Law and the Lore of Endowment Funds, published in 1969, that served as a further catalyst for action.
Out of this came a Ford Foundation grant of $2.8 million for the founding of The Common Fund for Nonprofit Organizations (Commonfund). Two years later, July, 1, 1971, The Common Fund was officially founded. Of the $2.8 million, $500,000 was earmarked for research and publications — a tradition that continues today. By the end of 1971, a total of 72 endowments had invested $63 million. We also launched our first investment fund, the Multi-Strategy Equity Fund, initiating an approach to investing that later would become known as the "endowment model".

Operating Assets





Home  >  Investments  >  Operating Assets 









The Operating Asset Challenge and Opportunity
Over our more than four decades of working with nonprofit institutions we have observed that many have excess liquidity and do not utilize best investment practices such as timeframe arbitrage and diversification in managing their operating assets. Commonfund is offering a comprehensive investment program structured to address this situation as many large operating entities are rethinking their fully liquid portfolios. We believe best practice is to transition these investors from a daily liquid portfolio to a more appropriate diversified limited-term portfolio. Dependent upon the risk tolerance of the individual organization, the investment solutions may range from fixed income only, to portfolios that include allocations to equities and alternatives. Due to liquidity needs and limited risk “appetites”, these portfolios should not be endowment-like in return expectation, or volatility.
Commonfund Cash Programs
Currently Commonfund offers investment programs in Liquid, Contingent and Core levels for higher education investors. We determine the “liquidity level” to be investments for daily needs to one year, “contingent level” to be investments not needed for three years and “core level” to be up to five years. For higher education institutions with significant cash portfolios we offer Commonfund Treasury+ program. The Treasury+ program offers operating asset investors a transition from a daily liquid portfolio to a more appropriate diversified limited-term portfolio. Commonfund plays an advisory role as well as investment provider in Treasury+ relationships. The program is flexible and completely customized to the risk and return needs of each investor using the full range of options described in the chart below. The program allows cash investors to earn a competitive return on their balances while maintaining the necessary risk controls and liquidity to reliably fund operations.

Commonfund Expands Hedge Fund Strategies Team
May 23 2012  |  9:24am ET

Institutional money manager Commonfund has tapped Brett Lane for the newly created position of managing director, hedge fund strategies.

In his new role at the Wilton, Conn.-based Commonfund, Lane will report to A. Nicholas De Monico, CEO, Commonfund hedge fund strategies group, and work alongside the firm’s account-specific “relationship officers” to help develop customized hedge fund solutions for its current and future clients.
“Brett is an integral addition to Commonfund, coming at an important time for the hedge fund strategies group as we expand market share and consider additional hedge fund solutions to develop,” said Nick De Monico, CEO, Commonfund hedge fund strategies group. “As hedge fund strategies become more prevalent, Brett’s past experience will help ensure that our portfolio of hedge fund solutions are positioned to reflect the needs of investors in the endowment, foundation and pension community at-large.”

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

NEWS RELEASE - Commercial real estate venture gets funded for $250K from funded.com's funding provider. Comment: I was very pleased with the speed and professional attitude of the site. I will recommend this to anyone in the future.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D
Entreprenuer





I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

DXUS - WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Hedged Dividend Fund






























































                            Fifty percent of the world’s investment opportunities are outside the United States1—and these companies are far from being foreign. They often represent the technologies we use, the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, the coffee we drink—and much more. And the bulk of these companies pay dividends too! Of course, international investments layer currency risk on top of equity risk. 
							
							The WisdomTree Global ex-U.S. Hedged Dividend Fund (DXUS) can help investors capitalize on the potential of a broad array of international dividend payers while mitigating the currency risk.

                                        This Fund is new and has limited operating history. Hedging can help returns when a foreign currency depreciates against the U.S. dollar, but it can hurt when the foreign currency appreciates against the U.S. dollar.
                                        
Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473) or visit wisdomtree.com. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Investments in emerging markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of companies in a single country or region, it is likely to be impacted by the events or conditions affecting that country or region. Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors and/or smaller companies increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company currently paying dividends may cease paying dividends at any time. The Fund uses various strategies to attempt to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency against the U.S. dollar, which may not be successful. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. Due to the investment strategy of this Fund, it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs. Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.
