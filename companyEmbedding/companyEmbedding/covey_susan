Enterprise Bank Announces Promotion of Susan Covey to Executive Vice President(Lowell, MA) Enterprise Bank is pleased to announce the promotion of Susan Covey to Executive Vice President/Branch Administration Director.
Susan has been a valuable part of the Enterprise Bank team since 2004, when she started as the Salem Branch Manager. In her most recent role as Branch Administration Director, Susan has overseen not only the back office department, but also the bank’s network of 22 branches located throughout the region. From staff development and logistics to communications and sales, Susan and the Branch Administration team provide vital support to the branch network and improved customer experience.
While at Enterprise Bank, Susan has contributed to many community initiatives and frequently spearheads charity fundraising efforts, including the bank’s volunteer night at the Cor Unum Meal Center in Lawrence. A board member of the Salem Boys and Girls Club for 12 years, she previously served as Board President and remains active on several committees. She is the President of the Board of Trustees for Salem Dollars for Scholars, and serves as a Trustee of the Trust Funds for the Town of Salem.
“Through a proven track record of excellence in managing the Enterprise Bank branch system, Susan has significantly contributed to the Bank’s growth, success, and—most importantly—customer service and satisfaction,” said Enterprise Bank CEO Jack Clancy. “Her skillful management of Enterprise Bank’s outstanding regional branch managers has led to continual improvement in developing and maintaining customer relationships, mentoring branch staff, and developing policies and procedures to make banking more secure, convenient, and enjoyable for our customers.”
A graduate of Southern New Hampshire University, Susan is a lifelong resident of Salem, NH, where she lives with her husband Michael. They have two children and five grandchildren.
About Enterprise Bank
Enterprise Bank has 22 full-service branch offices located in the New Hampshire communities of Derry, Hudson, Nashua, Pelham, and Salem and in the Massachusetts communities of Lowell, Acton, Andover, Billerica, Chelmsford, Dracut, Fitchburg, Lawrence, Leominster, Methuen, Tewksbury, Tyngsborough, and Westford. Enterprise Bank’s 23rd branch, a second Nashua branch at 493-495 Amherst Street, will open in the spring of 2016.
As of December 31, 2015, assets were $2.29 billion. Total assets under management totaled $3.04 billion.
