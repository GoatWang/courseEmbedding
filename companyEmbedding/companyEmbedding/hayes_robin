8/17/11-I must say I was alittle nervous making a big ticket purchase on-line. Anyway I called and got a quote from VICKIE who was very courteous and professional over the phone. I made my purchase of the AICO EDEN Collection. MY bedroom set came much sooner than the anticipated date. Lets just say it is SOOO BEAUTIFUL****** words cannot explain. The picture on-line does it no justice. I will definitely purchase again and would recommend any one looking for top of the line, durable, sophicated, master piece furniture to shop here. Prices are unbeatable and the end reward is excellent. THANKS HOME GALLERY FOR MY BEDROOM SET.

The term McDonaldization was coined by George Ritzer in 1993 and is a valuable tool for providing a theoretical and practical debate concerning novel and defining features of our contemporary world. The contributors to this collection, academics and writers from three countries, examine the McDonaldization of higher education in contemporary society.The growing literature on McDonaldization shows the power of the term to describe the extension of industrial rationalization (commodification) to wider society. In the context of higher education, one can see the application of Ritzer's four features of McDonaldization, efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. For example: higher education is becoming more efficient because it is processing more students by introducing multiple choice exams (US) or by removing exams altogether (UK) and replacing them with forms of continuous assessment, which leads to grade inflation and more students passing. The contributors to this volume, 15 academics and writers from three continents, examine what can be called the McDonaldization of higher education and the impact this has on the idea of the university as a liberal institution primarily engaged in the pursuit of knowledge.

 Warranty Limitations
The Rowe Warranty is limited in that it is provided to you, the original purchaser and owner. The Rowe Warranty does not apply to furniture that has been abused or used in a business environment and/or for commercial purposes. The Rowe Warranty only applies to furniture used for normal residential purposes.  Our warranty does not cover products sold in “distressed” or “as is” condition, products sold “second hand” or products purchased from a retailer, or any other form of reseller, not authorized by Rowe to sell our products. All warranties cover labor for 1 year only. Floor sample sale items are warranted for 1 year only.  All of the Limited Warranties set forth below are subject to these Warranty Limitations.
 Lifetime Limited Warranty - Frames, Springs, & Mechanisms
Frames and spring systems are under warranty to be free from manufacturing defects for the life of the product.
 5-Year Limited Warranty - Sleeper Mechanisms and Swivel Chair/Rocker Mechanisms
Motion mechanisms and specific fixtures are under warranty to be free from manufacturing defects for five (5) years (this includes, but may not be limited to, swivel/rocker bases and sleep sofa mechanisms).
 3-Year Limited Warranty on Innerspring and Cloud Contour Mattresses
Standard Rowe Sleep Sofa Innerspring and Cloud Contour Mattresses are under warranty to be free from manufacturing defects and against the loss of foam resiliency for three (3) years.
Optional CloudCoil Sleep Sofa Mattresses are under warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for three(3) years, including the air mattress bladder and internal electric pump.  
 5-Year Limited –Seat Cushion Cores
Foam cores (not polyester fiber wrap) in all cushions (except in Feather Soft cushions) are under warranty to be free from manufacturing defects and against the loss of foam resiliency for five (5) years, with validation of normal wear and tear and confirmation by manufacturer of resiliency loss.  Abnormal wear and abnormal loss of resiliency should not be confused with the softening and flattening of the foam and fibers, which is considered normal wear, and are not defects.  Feather Soft Cushions consist of a high resiliency (HR) foam core wrapped with super-soft foam, surrounded by a balanced blend of down, feather and multi-denier polyester fibers, encased in a channeled down-proof ticking. While this breathable ticking is down-proof, and creates a feather barrier, feathers will poke through the fabric from time-to-time. This is considered normal performance and is not a defect. Feather Soft cushions are under warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for one (1) year.
 Seat Cushion Care and Performance Characteristics
Our 1.8 density high resiliency (HR) foam cores are environmentally friendly, containing no ABAs or CFCs. Also there are no PBDEs and we use Halogen free fire retardants. While foam will soften, it should not lose resiliency or the ability to recover from compression. Polyester wraps, used to create surface softness, will, over time, lose some of the initial loft, which may contribute to cushion flattening and wrinkling. This is normal.  Our softer and more casual cushions, the M850 series, Feather Soft cushions and cushion packages will, by design, flatten, wrinkle and soften. We suggest you fluff these cushions as you would fluff the feather or down pillow you sleep on.
You can prolong cushion life and keep your cushions looking fresh by turning and rotating them regularly. You may also want to regulate the cushion core and polyester wrap by unzipping the casing and adjusting the fit of the core and polyester wrap. We do not suggest removing the cushion core from the casing.
 One (1) Year Limited Warranty - fabrics, back filling materials, zippers & fastenings
Upholstery fabrics, including slipcovers, are under warranty for one (1) year against seam slippage, fraying and dye transfer, but only if any cleaning conforms to industry standard methods. This warranty does not cover wearing, wrinkling, fading, pilling.  ANY SELF-TREATMENT OR RETAILER APPLIED SOIL REPELLER VOIDS THIS WARRANTY.
Back pillow filling materials are under warranty for one (1) year against the loss of foam resiliency.
Foam filling materials are under warranty for one (1) year against the loss of foam resiliency.
Zippers and seams are under warranty for one (1) year against failure, including seam slippage.
 Prolong the Life of Your Fabric
Dust and dirt promote premature fabric wear. Vacuum the surface of your furniture regularly, including the deck under the cushions, with the upholstery attachment of your vacuum cleaner. Direct sunlight can cause some fabrics to fade. Care should be taken to limit the amount of direct sun on any piece of furniture.
 Rowe's Promise
Within the provisions, time allowances and limitations of this warranty, Rowe promises to repair or replace, at their option, any part or parts they deem to have manufacturing or material defects.
 Service
To request service under this warranty, contact the authorized Rowe Retailer from whom you purchased your Rowe furniture. The Retailer will, in turn, contact us. Certain defects may be repaired in your home with our authorization for the first year. Some repairs will need to be made at the factory service center. The Rowe Warranty does not include the cost, if any, of transportation to or from the retail location. The Retailer will contact our Factory Service Center to schedule a pick up from the Retailer and subsequent service. The Rowe Warranty does not include the cost of transporting the furniture to and from the Factory Service Center after one (1) year from the date of purchase. If service is not handled through the retailer where purchase was made, shipping and handling charges will apply.
Shipping and handling costs for parts are covered for one (1) year from original date of purchase. After one (1) year, customer will be responsible for shipping and handling costs.  Certain information is required to process a request for service which includes a copy of your sales receipt and the serial number for each piece of furniture. You will find the Style and Serial Numbers on the white label sewn to the underside of the piece of furniture or under the seat cushions. Without proper validation of the furniture the warranty will not be valid.  If either you or the retailer has moved, you may contact our Customer Care Department at www.rowefurniture.com.
Rowe Furniture shall, in no event, be responsible for any incidental or consequential damage and in no event shall the responsibility of Rowe exceed the purchase price of the product or its replacement. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damage, so the foregoing limitation or exclusion may or may not apply to you.
