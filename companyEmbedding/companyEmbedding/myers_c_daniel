Summary



Resumé / Bio C. Daniel Myers									

PROFESSIONAL PROFILE

CEO / Business Development Manager/ Product Marketing / Strategy Consultant
Proven contributor, manager, and consultant whose strengths in understanding fundamental customer requirements, applying relevant leading edge technologies combined with a deep background in marketing has generated significant revenue and performance results for many clients and companies. Broad operational experience ranging from marketing, business development, and project management to customer support operations coupled with experience in all key information technologies -- from mainframes, Unix systems, PC's, Security, networking and web applications. This unique cross-discipline experience enables me to identify key targets and objectives, and build integrated strategic plans and to direct implementation with a very high success rate.  


EXPERIENCE
Took role of CEO for a workout effort with LegacyJ, a Cobol-to-Java modernization company, evaluating viability of the company, its patents, its core software. Resolved a continuing lawsuit to our benefit, rewrote the company's business plan, pursued multiple funding options, signed a significant licensee for the software intellectual property, and managed the reduction in activity.

For automotive, restaurant, banking, training, entertainment, education and medical consulting clients, I performed full marketing analyses, generating plans, programs, and training to implement or revamp all aspects of company/organization delivery of products and services. 

For clients over the past decade, I have designed, implemented, trained and managed Customer Relationship Management systems that enhance sales teams' abilities to manage pipelines, keep on top of decision-makers and influencers, and communicate clearly to management. 

Security technologies range from DES to AES encryption systems and devices, IBM mainframe communication systems to smart cards, biometrics, sign-on systems, in-storage and networked applications.

For a smart card authentication company, I ran projects, coordinating all aspects of major rollouts of 50,000 to 150,000 users, 4 Million cards for the DOD, and a variety of HIPPA pilot projects for medical institutions 

For a financial investment group, I designed all marketing and technical issues associated with a calculation-intensive Microsoft-centric website provisioned for 25,000 users to hit every afternoon from 4-7p to get critical batting averages for big stock pickers

For a highly competitive storage company, I ran the product marketing function for the transition from a "captive" IBM OEM to Open systems Unix and PC-compatible product lines, generating 10 new products in a year

For Sperry/Unisys in Sacramento, I ran a $40M Dept. of Justice sole source proposal, generated $22M in profit. Then started their Unix business, generating $30M in business by designing all aspects of how to sell, install, service, and maintain that business for the State of California., I revamped their RFP response process, going from 90% losses to 90% wins and generating $35M in annual revenue for each of the 4 years I was there. As Professional Services Manager for the State team, I coordinated planning, software implementation and development cycles, trained technical staff on quality processes, data flow documentation, project management for all clients.

For the 15 largest banks in New York and San Francisco, I performed full security consulting engagements, analyzing all aspects of their current uses of technology, identifying critical issues and fixes and laying out new technology implementation pathways

For an encryption startup, I performed all the marketing functions, branding, advertising, product identification, analysis, MRD, PRD, channel setup, sales team hiring, training, development, generating $3M million dollars in revenue in 2 years
For several Silicon Valley startups, I created the technical support departments, channel marketing processes, and product marketing functions.
