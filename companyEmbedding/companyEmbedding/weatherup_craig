Craig Weatherup: What’s your leadership model?
January 5, 2011
Retired CEO Craig Weatherup was addressing a group of finance undergraduates at the W. P. Carey School recently when he popped a question. "How many of you would profess to have a model or a definition of how you want to grow as a leader?" he asked. Three or four hands went up. "I think everybody should raise their hand on that question, and I’ll tell you why," he said. Weatherup himself has a model for leadership: a simple yet comprehensive set of attitudes and behaviors that have shaped him in his personal life and as the leader of people and organizations — often through periods of dramatic change.

Retired CEO Craig Weatherup was addressing a group of finance undergraduates at the W. P. Carey School recently when he popped a question. “How many of you would profess to have a model or a definition of how you want to grow as a leader?” he asked. Three or four hands went up. “I think everybody should raise their hand on that question, and I’ll tell you why,” he said.
Weatherup himself has a model for leadership: a simple yet comprehensive set of attitudes and behaviors that have shaped him in his personal life and as the leader of people and organizations — often through periods of dramatic change.
“Leadership is something you develop, and it can be developed at a very early age,” Weatherup told the group. But, he said, you have to be proactive about it. It’s important to decide how you want to lead, and why. The resulting model will be different for every individual, but according to Weatherup, what’s important is to have a model — one that fits.
Weatherup began to develop his model while still in his thirties, and it propelled him through a career that peaked with stints as chairman and CEO of Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc. (including leading the company’s IPO), CEO of Pepsi-Cola Company and president of PepsiCo, Inc. The model continues to guide him today as a corporate and non-profit board member and mentor to CEOs.
These are given
Weatherup, a Phoenix native and a W. P. Carey alumnus with a degree in accounting, went to work for General Foods immediately after graduation. “I had envisioned going to work in New York at the corporate headquarters,” he said. “Instead I ended up in Kankakee, Illinois, whose claim to fame was that it had the world’s largest dog food plant.” He started as a cost analyst at the factory, but his next position was in New York, in the General Foods financial analysis division. The head of marketing, who had noticed Weatherup’s work on a special project in Illinois, took an interest in his career, and Weatherup was able to transfer to marketing. For about five years he was a brand manager, learning classic marketing.
Then, “PepsiCo came calling,” he recounted, and he moved his wife and two small children to Tokyo. A brief posting in New York followed, then the Weatherups were off to Brazil. Back in the U.S. again, the last 18 years of his career were spent in top executive positions with the company. Now retired, Weatherup serves on the boards of directors of Starbucks Corporation, Macy’s, Inc. and the Arizona Nature Conservancy. He is an active supporter of the Bishop’s Fund for Children in Connecticut, Tuskegee University, and Arizona State University.
How does someone build a leadership portfolio like that? Weatherup said that it requires focus — something more than fulfilling the core qualifications to be successful.
“The given here is that you have smarts, you have great ethics, you have great values and you work hard,” he said. Anyone expecting to succeed is expected to possess those qualities — what he called “the givens.” Leadership, however, is what develops when you add something more, and that’s where a model is needed.
Weatherup’s model comprises six points: three that involve developing yourself and three that guide your interactions with others.
It’s all about breadth
The first three points in Weatherup’s model all relate to what he calls “breadth.”
Number one is broadening the self, he said. “In this case it’s about the breadth of your humanity,” he said. “Anything you can do to get breadth is a huge, huge determinant in how successful you’re going to be as a leader.” He said to look for opportunities not only on the job, but in all parts of life: through family, friends, community, travel, volunteering, church.
Number two is professional experiential breadth. He told the students that their attendance at the Financial Management Association meeting where he was speaking was a step toward breadth. Other ways to broaden yourself could include working on a task force or taking a chance to do something outside your specialization.
“I wouldn’t ignore depth, but if you’ve worked at many of the companies I’ve been involved with — the boards that I’m on — depth is a given. If you’ve got a job you’ll go as deep as you need to go to know it and know it cold,” he said. “To me what’s far harder to get and far, far more important is breadth.”
He noted that he started his career with an accounting degree, working in a plant, but when he went to New York he switched to finance and marketing, then he accepted assignments oversees.
“Breadth is the definer,” he said. “I’d venture to bet that the top 10 in this room are the people with the broadest set of experiences.”
The third point is to learn to value and use failure.
“It’s an absolute truism,” he said. “You will not grow without risk, and you will not take risks if you do not value failing.” Individuals and companies espouse this point all the time, he said, but “I find this is normally not the case.” However, “failure in itself has great value, if it was a risk worth taking.”
Weatherup said he puts these three points — breadth of humanity, breadth of experience and valuing failure — together because they are the well a leader draws from when it’s time to make a decision.
“Nobody ever wanted the things that arrived at my desk. Half the facts were on the left, half the facts were to the right, or there were no facts,” he said. “Often it ends up being judgment, and judgment is about intuition and instinct and experience. You’ll make far better decisions if you have a broad set of experiences.”
Leadership of others
His second three points related to execution. You’ve articulated a vision and made a brilliant decision. Now you have to execute, and “99 percent of the time you have to execute with people.” How do you get people to follow you and feel passion for your vision?
First, he said, you have to show that you truly care about those people. “When things are really tough, when it’s unclear, when nobody knows what’s really happening, they follow you because they think and because you’ve demonstrated that you really care about them,” he said. From the janitor to the chief of staff, Weatherup said, affirm that person’s human dignity. That’s the one thing that inspires passionate followership.
Second, he said, act out of your deeply held sense of self worth. “If you don’t have the strength of your convictions you cannot persevere, and you certainly cannot engender those feelings and confidence in those who work for you.”
Self worth, he added, is the product of broad experience. “Confidence comes from failing, experiencing different things, being challenged in different circumstances,” he said.
Weatherup said he borrowed the sixth point from a consultant who worked with him somewhere along the way: Do the work head, heart and hands — yourself. “If you aren’t out there with the troops, using your hands, you won’t engender the followership you want,” he said.
Lessons from the edge of change: enroll, simplify, persevere 
A leader must be able to manage the status quo, but if you want to get anywhere you need to be able to lead through change, Weatherup said. “Real growth is change,” he said. “Life is change. Circumstances change.” But, to paraphrase an old song, the fundamental things can be applied, especially during change. Weatherup offered three examples from his experience.
Scenario One: In 1992 Weatherup was running the North American beverage business for PepsiCo when he and his director of marketing looked at the numbers and concluded that the cola category had topped out. “The math of an aging population was driving it.” Based on that, he presented a new vision to the board, that PepsiCo had to become a total beverage company in order to continue to thrive. The company needed multiple categories: water, bottled tea, sports drink, juice and coffee businesses.
The board disagreed, he said, but he told them that no matter what he did cola was not going to grow. Wall Street responded to “stick with your knitting,” and even the competition, Coca Cola, asserted at the time that it was an all-cola company. He said his own company didn’t believe the numbers, either, and certainly didn’t want to deal with the complexities of that many products.
That was the setting. “The vision, which was maybe radical in those days, was relatively easy to come up with. Getting people to understand it and trust you and follow you was incredibly difficult because there’s nothing obvious about where you wanted to take them and why.”
Scenario Two: In 1996 Pepsico International experienced a meltdown. The company was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal for weeks, and PepsiCo took a $750 million charge. The international company missed its pre-tax profit plan by $1 billion, “a lot of money in those days.”
Weatherup, who had been running Pepsi North America, asked “where do you start?” The president and CEO of PCI had already departed when, in the course of one week, Weatherup asked the other nine senior executives to resign.
“Everybody knows you have to change — the issues were strategy, culture, operating philosophy, business model, people, organization … so how do you deal with that sort of situation?” he commented.
Scenario Three: In 1999 Weatherup was in charge of splitting off Pepsi Bottling Company in what was at the time the fifth largest IPO in U.S. history: it involved a $10 billion entity with 40,000 employees.
The challenge was to get everyone on board for a move that on the surface seemed to involve no major change: same people, same trucks, same plant. To those 40,000 employees it appeared to be a bad move, Weatherup said: “Why leave a $40 billion, powerful, successful PepsiCo for this IPO company?”
What were the lessons learned from the three scenarios?
First, in each case there was a need to “enroll the organization,” Weatherup said. Each scenario was a case where there was confusion about the facts or the strategy or some other element of change. To deal with it, the leadership developed what Weatherup called a process of enrollment, to educate the entire organization quickly. In the case of the IPO, every individual Teamster was touched by a manager “relative to what this is and why we did it.”
Second, in dealing with major change, “simplify, clarify.” As an example, Weatherup pointed to the strategic direction statement for the IPO Pepsi Bottling Company — about 25 words that include “We sell soda.” It was all about simplicity, he said, because they were trying to drive behavior change.
Third, once you’ve launched a change, drive through to the finish. Weatherup quoted a study of Fortune 500 companies showing that in the majority of cases where companies attempted a change initiative they failed. And the number one reason they failed was that they quit. “There are no time outs,” he said. “It’s all about persevering, not accepting ‘no.'”
Leadership is hard, he concluded. At the upper echelons it’s a 24/7 endeavor. In order to maintain the effort, a leader must find a compelling reason to go on — something more than making money or collecting perks. In Weatherup’s case it is a desire to be a servant leader.
“My faith has grounded me in the fact that I care about the people I lead, and I do think it’s my job to serve them,” he said. That’s his model.
The question for the students in attendance was “what’s yours?”
— Weatherup was the guest of the Financial Management Association (FMA) student chapter at the W. P. Carey School of Business. The FMA affords finance and other business students the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge of the finance industry and the realities of working in the field. The W. P. Carey student chapter has been recognized by the FMA as a “Superior Chapter” for several years running.

Weatherup Takes on the Pepsi Challenge

By Chief Executive -   November 1, 2000 




Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter






Craig Weatherup loves trucks.Truck models, truck paintings, truck sculpture all decorate the office of the Pepsi Bottling Group’s (PBG) chairman and CEO. A gleaming Pepsi 16-wheeler, bearing the corporate motto “We Sell Soda,” wraps around both covers of PBG’s first post-IPO annual report. The fact that ground transportation is the hub of his business may explain the PBG chief executive’s choice of decor. With only 450 of PBG’s 37,000 worldwide workforce based at the Somers, NY, headquarters, Weatherup knows that delivering product to “the field” is the key to the beverage giant’s growth. This 25-year veteran of Cola Wars fights for every inch of shelf, counter, rack, cooler, and floor space from Miami to Montreal, from Madrid to Moscow.Weatherup, 55, took PBG, which manufactures and distributes 30 percent of Pepsi products worldwide, public in March of 1999 in the fifth-largest IPO in history, with parent PepsiCo as its major stockholder, holding a 40 percent stake. Suddenly, this old bricks-and-mortar company was afloat in a sea of new launches, where it stood out from its predominantly dot-corn neighbors thanks to several key differences: a legendary, century-old brand equity; deep market penetration; an established customer base and distribution network, including 7,000 trucks; and sales of more than $7 billion, with anticipated operating income in excess of $300 million.For Weatherup, who had served as CEO of the Pepsi-Cola Co. from 1996 to 1998, the challenge of separating PepsiCo’s bottling and distribution arm from the parent company, was enormous                and an irresistible opportunity. “I didn’t want to do anything [else] at PepsiCo, and I didn’t want to be CEO of some other company, despite many, many attractive offers,” he explains. “[PBG] was a unique event, and I thought I could make a big, big difference.“The PepsiCo bottling operation had not grown profits for three straight years, and we were losing [market] share,” he adds. “Coca-Cola spun off Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) in 1986. It was our time.”Weatherup’s enthusiasm impressed Roger Enrico, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo Inc. (encompassing the Pepsi-Cola Company, Frito-Lay, and Tropicana Products). Enrico had already experienced his resolve firsthand after Chris Sinclair, then CEO of Pepsi’s troubled international operations, abruptly resigned, stalking out of a company meeting. Weatherup emerged from the meeting with Sinclair’s post and 10 days later chaired a worldwide meeting of PepsiCo management, which led to the termination of 10 senior executives and 1,300 employees (11 percent of the division), and the closing 18 of 85 overseas offices. The reorganization’s price tag was a $500 million write-off.Ironically, three years later finds Coca-Cola weathering a similar restructuring. “Coca-Cola has taken serious write-offs-$813 million in fourth quarter 1999-and the scenario is the same as ours in ’97,” says Weatherup. “To be blunt, they got ahead of themselves. You can’t get too carried away with success. I’ve learned that even if you are the best and overplay it, you’ll pay big time.”The turnabout has analysts reevaluating the cola players. “Wow, what a difference a year makes,” says Bill Pecoriello, beverage industry analyst for Sanford Bernstein. “There was a lot of skepticism on the street about PBG’s IPO. CCE was the gold standard of bottlers, the reason PBG even came into existence. Now PBG’s got the momentum. All the planets have aligned for Craig.”Coke’s stumble offers PBG an opportunity to “really knock the cover off the ball,” asserts Pecoriello. “Craig’s performance has forced CCE to reevaluate their failed U.S. strategy of ‘market share at any cost.’ ““They’re holding their own against CCE and then some,” he adds. “That’s because of Craig’s leadership. He’s motivated the troops, he’s in the trenches, and he knows that you win on a local level, store by store, one vending machine at a time.”A believer in hands-on leadership, Weatherup has been known to pitch in on the front lines. During one field visit he recounts crawling under the bar-“a slimy, awful place”-at the Las Vegas Shark Club to replace springs in a broken beverage dispenser. “They bounced all over the place,” he says. “The real technicians enjoyed this to no end.“People need to know that you care about them and that you’re worthy of their followership,” he says, explaining his belief that “the winning company with the highest stock price will be the one that has humanity.”This focus on the soft side was initially met with skepticism by industry veterans, but Weatherup’s success has brought some former critics around. Tom Pirko, president of industry consulting firm Bevmark LLC, who once questioned whether Weatherup had the “basic brutality” to go head to head with Coca-Cola, now concedes, “People trust him; they perform for him.”Weatherup’s current challenge is to beat last year’s numbers. PBG sold a billion cases of beverages to more than 800,000 customers in 1999 and posted revenues of $7.5 billion, reporting an impressive 13 percent growth that exceeded predictions of 8 to 10 percent. Net revenues were up 7 percent, while return on invested capital was up a point to 6 percent. Earnings per share (EPS) were up 318 percent over the previous year. Second quarter 2000 numbers suggest continued solid growth, with EPS up 81 percent at $.58 for the quarter, versus $.32 in 1999.With 92 percent of PBG’s volume in North America, Weatherup plans to acquire, on average, 1 to 2 percent of the North American Pepsi bottling system annually. PBG’s bottler acquisitions to date have been contiguous to existing PBG markets, a growth strategy that couples adding volume with realizing cost savings in raw materials, manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and general administration.“We’re now better able to respond quickly to customers’ entire system needs as more of their outlets fall into our markets,” explains Weatherup. “This is especially true as the grocery business consolidates. The Coke system has consolidated faster than the Pepsi system in North America. Whichever system, Pepsi or Coke, consolidates best and quickest will likely have a competitive leg up with the resulting efficiencies of scale.” In addition to distribution, Coke and Pepsi continue to duke it out over market share, a battle made more complicated by shifting beverage market trends.Growth in the bottled water segment is now four times that of carbonated drinks, and consumer tastes have shifted from soft drinks to noncarbonated, “natural” beverages like Snapple and SoBe. Yet Pepsi’s flagship carbonated brands, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Mountain Dew make up more than 70 percent of its product line, and its Aquafina brand holds a mere 2 percent share of the bottled water segment. While Pepsi ONE, Dr. Pepper, Starbucks Frappuccino, and Lipton’s Iced Tea currently make up the rest of the domestic mix, Weatherup promises that PBG’s “whole brand portfolio is undergoing major, major change. Our No. 1 charter for the balance of 2000 is to make sure we’re really playing across the entire beverage category.”For Weatherup that’s a battle of epic proportions but one he has every intention of winning. “The Evil Empire in Star Wars always reminds me of Coke,” he said. “But if you remember [the movie], the rebellion won.”Vital statisticsCraig VVEATHERUPChairman and Chief Executive Pepsi Bottling Group “It staggers me that being nice is seen as being inconsistent with being tough.”Age: 55Birthplace: NYCFamily: Wife, Connie; Children, Clint, Christine, Scott, and BrockEducation: B.S., Arizona State University, 1967.Recreation: Hiking, snow-skiing, reading.

ASU Alumni Association


















 












craig weatherup '67 b.s.












As a native of Phoenix, Craig Weatherup graduated from ASU’s W. P. Carey School of Business in 1967 with a bachelor’s degree in accounting. After graduating, Weatherup took his first job in Kankakee, Ill., working at General Foods as a cost analyst. Later, he moved to New York to General Food’s corporate headquarters to take a position in the Financial Analysis division. He began his career with Pepsi-Cola in 1974 as the Pepsi-Cola Marketing Director for the Far East stationed in Tokyo, Japan; Weatherup spent the next eight years in international operations in a variety of positions.
After serving in a number of leadership positions within the Pepsi business group, he was appointed CEO of Pepsi-Cola North America in 1990. In 1996, he was named president of PepsiCo, Inc., and, later that year, appointed chairman and CEO of Pepsi-Cola. Weatherup retired in January 2003 as the founding chairman and CEO of the Pepsi Bottling Group, Inc., a post he assumed in November 1998. Weatherup was given an honorary doctorate from ASU in 1999, and currently is on the board of directors for Starbucks, Macy’s, Inc., and the Arizona Nature Conservancy. Weatherup and his wife, Connie, have donated generously to ASU over the years.  In 2008, they gave $5 million to Sun Devil Athletics, which assisted in the creation of the Weatherup Center, a state-of-the-art indoor practice facility and training center for the men’s and women’s basketball teams.

Boston Business Leaders Breakfast: Craig Weatherup


“Servant leadership has allowed me to find personal fulfillment in everything I do, and the ability to treat every person with the human dignity they deserve.” —Craig Weatherup
At the Boston Business Leaders Breakfast on Friday, September 20, Gordon College President D. Michael Lindsay welcomed Craig Weatherup, retired Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. Held at 60 State Street with the city’s seaport and business district skyline visible from the glass-walled banquette room, it was Gordon’s first BLB of the academic year.
Craig Weatherup is the founding Chairman and CEO of The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG). He retired in 2003 from PepsiCo and currently serves on the Board of Directors for the Starbucks Coffee Company, Macy’s Department Stores, Inc., and The Arizona Nature Conservancy.
To a crowd of 400 invited guests, Weatherup described his first job for Pepsi Co and the networking connections he developed while working in New York City. “When the marketing director asked me what I wanted to do with my career, as any future business person says, I wanted a future in marketing,” he recalled. His response led to a new career abroad. Weatherup and his family boarded a plane for Tokyo, Japan, where at age 28 he began his work as PepsiCo’s Marketing Director for the Far East. “There I was on a plane flying with my family to a city where we knew no one, didn’t speak the language, and were moving sight-unseen to a new country,” said Weatherup.
Despite Pepsi’s rigorous travel schedule throughout his corporate career—he often went around the world in a week—Weatherup shared how he juggled his work with his commitments to his family and faith. Today, he is one of only two members of the Starbucks Board of Directors who bring their family with them during their travels.
When asked about his most spectacular failure, Weatherup had a ready response: “That’s easy… It was Crystal Pepsi.” A $20 million venture released in the early nineties during the Super Bowl, it was Pepsi’s clear-cola beverage . . . and it struggled immediately. “We were able to get a lot of people to try Crystal Pepsi,” Weatherup joked with the executives in attendance, “but after that no one ever wanted to try it again.”  He also shared his greatest achievements, saying that he considers the most influential moments in his career to be those in which he was able to mentor someone else’s career. “There is nothing better than getting that call or email, sometimes even years later, where someone thanks me for how I handled something or weathered a storm on a public platform and they admired the way we approached it. Those are the best moments, and the ones I’m most happy to have had as a CEO.”?
Weatherup expressed an optimistic view of the international business world, countering some others' views that there is "a malaise of sorts," as he put it.“ Things are very much alive in places like Asia and Latin America,” he asserted, expressing excitement about the future. Weatherup also shared about the recent meeting in Mexico City during which the Starbucks board made its decision to ban guns from its stores.
President Lindsay, who created the largest research study on American leadership, has interviewed past U.S. presidents, corporate CEOs and other important national leaders. “When he is interviewing someone on stage, it’s great to see how he moves the conversation along in front of a large audience,” said student John Buckley ’15, a Gordon College Presidential Fellow, who attended the event. “The event is for business leaders, but the College always makes sure student can attend and it’s a very unique opportunity for us.”
The Business Leaders Breakfast is a Gordon College speaker series for CEOs and business executives. Each breakfast hosts a distinguished business leader from a variety of corporate industries to share their views on leadership in an interview-style format with Gordon’s president. Speakers share personal stories of successes, failures, and watershed moments of their careers, as a way to bring business executives—as well as Gordon students—together for a time of networking, learning and mentoring.

        Leadership      
Craig Weatherup: Learning from success and failure
May 23, 2007
The essence of leadership is the ability to make the right decision, and to be able to do that leaders need breadth of experience. Take risks, advises Craig Weatherup, retired chairman and CEO of The Pepsi Bottling Group, and open yourself to new experiences in your personal and professional life. And, understand that failure is a great teacher. Weatherup addressed some 650 W. P. Carey MBA, masters degree and doctoral graduates at the Spring 2007 convocation.

Craig Weatherup, now retired as chairman and CEO of The Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG), has had more than the full measure of success in his career.
Recently he shared some of the insights he gained during his 29-year career at PepsiCo with some 650 W. P. Carey MBA, masters and doctoral degree graduates at the school’s convocation. Weatherup talked about leadership and success, but his message veered from the usual CEO script. Value and use failure, he said. “You will not grow without risk, and will not risk unless you value failure as a teacher.”
An unconventional business guru
A 1967 graduate of the W. P. Carey School, Weatherup was in the lead when Pepsi marketers came up with some of the brand’s most memorable marketing initiatives. There were catchy jingles that you couldn’t quit singing, and the famous “Pepsi Challenge,” which pitted Pepsi against beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola and converted countless testers into instant customers. Perhaps most significantly, starting in Japan, he built Pepsi into a favorite of local residents the world over — not just American expatriates eager for a taste of home.
Weatherup is widely acknowledged as a primary driver behind Pepsi’s extraordinary success. But hear him describe his leadership style to the new grads, and a strikingly unconventional business guru emerges from the pinstripes and polished wingtips.
Some experts advise dusting off your resume every five to seven years, but Weatherup spent 30 years at PepsiCo.
As a new accounting graduate, his goal was to run a major division of a huge company someday. Over the years, his general goals stayed much the same, while his specific goals evolved. And indeed, the day came when he did run a major division. He began his career in 1974 as Pepsi-Cola marketing director for the Far East, stationed in Tokyo, Japan. Then he spent the next eight years in international operations in a variety of positions.
In 1982, Weatherup joined the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group and was named president of the division in 1986. He was appointed chief executive officer of Pepsi-Cola North America in 1990. In 1996, he was named president of PepsiCo, Inc., and later that year, appointed chairman and chief executive officer of Pepsi-Cola Company.
In addition, Weatherup realized leadership is not the sole province of the top executive. “Everyone aspires to lead others in some aspect of their lives,” he told the graduates. One person is called to teach Sunday School to kids, he said, while others might lead in a community or civic group. Each is a leader, although often not identified as a decision-maker at their place of employment.
Grow by taking risks … and sometimes failing
Weatherup embraces “servant leadership,” which he described as “seeing leadership as an extraordinary privilege given to you by those you lead.” The chief mechanism of leadership is “making the right decision.” But, as he pointed out in his speech, that leaves an enormous question: how do you acquire the insight, will and perseverance you need to make the right judgment?
“Barring conflicting facts, half of the room will always want to go left and half of the room will want to go right. At the end of the day, leadership is making that call,” Weatherup explained.
Leaders function at their highest, he said, when they constantly expand their life experiences, both on and off the job. “It’s all about breadth of experiences,” he said, “which is something only acquired through risk.”
This is the heart of Weatherup’s message: Taking risks develops leadership skills, but it also carries the chance of failure. Weatherup left his first post-college employer, General Foods, for a marketing management position with Pepsi way back in 1974. That early leap from accounting to marketing marked one of his first major risks, he told grads.
“I acquired breadth of experience by taking small and sometimes big risks, going into the unknown,” he continued. “You will be uncomfortable. You will understand that you just don’t know the answer, and you need to find it.”
Train to be a leader
There are three steps to building leadership skills, according to Weatherup.
Start by seeking out opportunities that widen the breadth of your experiences. Failure is a possibility — but so is success, he said.
“Living as the most complete human being you can be” is a goal that results not only in mastery of the skills and knowledge necessary for top-notch leadership, he said. It’s also a direct path towards a healthy balance between work, family and play. If you’re living as that most complete human being as a way of building leadership skills and boosting your career, then there’s plenty of time and attention scheduled for family, friends, hobbies, volunteer work and the like.
To keep on schedule, he lives by a few rules. For instance, by noon on Saturday, if not earlier, his briefcase is packed up and stashed in the closet until it’s time to leave for work Monday morning. Before he retired, when he was in meetings, his staff was instructed to interrupt for only two people — his wife or the company’s chairman. And, he and his wife always reserved at least 10 days for a family vacation every year.
His second piece of advice on leadership-skill building is to embrace lateral or unexpected career moves. The payoff will not be in big raise or fancier office now, but could position you for even more satisfying experiences down the road a bit.
Another aspect of success and leadership that Weatherup could have mentioned is generosity. Inducted into the W. P. Carey School’s Hall of Fame in 1986, he continues to be involved with the university, currently giving his time and insights as the chairman of the ASU Foundation Board of Directors. And he has put resources behind his passion for developing leadership in managers through his sponsorship of the Weatherup/Overby Chair in Management. Angelo Kinicki, whose research and consulting interests include leadership, currently holds the chair at the W. P. Carey School.
