        Tilden Park is a multi-strategy fixed-income-focused alternative asset manager headquartered in New York City.  We concentrate primarily on structured products and mortgages, fixed income relative value and related corporate credit and equity strategies.  The firm is led by Josh Birnbaum, formerly co-manager of trading in the Structured Products Group at Goldman Sachs.
        
        Our investment goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by identifying asymmetric risk/return profiles.   Capital preservation is a central focus.  Tilden Parkâs trading philosophy is to harmonize a systematic approach that identifies market inefficiencies through a combination of fundamental models and tactical market-based tools with top-down common sense driven investment views.
