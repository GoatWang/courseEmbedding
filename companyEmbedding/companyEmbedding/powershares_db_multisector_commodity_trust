A substantial amount of proceeds of the offering of the Shares are used by the
Fund to engage in the trading of exchange-traded futures on the Index Commodity
with a view to tracking the changes, positive or negative, in the level of the
Index over time, less the expenses of the operations of the Fund. The Fund’s
portfolio also includes United States Treasury securities and other high credit
quality short-term fixed income securities for deposit with the Fund’s Commodity
Broker as margin.

To the extent that the Fund trades in futures contracts on United States
exchanges, the assets deposited by the Fund with its Commodity Broker as
margin must be segregated pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such
segregated funds may be invested only in a limited range of instruments -
principally U.S. government obligations.

To the extent, if any, that the Fund trades in futures on markets other than
regulated United States futures exchanges, funds deposited to margin positions
held on such exchanges are invested in bank deposits or in instruments of a
credit standing generally comparable to those authorized by the CFTC for
investment of “customer segregated funds,” although applicable CFTC rules
prohibit funds employed in trading on foreign exchanges from being deposited in
“customer segregated fund accounts.”

Although the following percentages may vary substantially over time, as of the
date of this Prospectus, the Fund estimates that approximately 100% of the net
asset value of the Fund is maintained in segregated accounts in the name of the
Fund with the Commodity Broker in the form of cash or United States Treasury
bills. Approximately 10% of the net asset value of the Fund may be held in cash
at any one time. Such funds are segregated pursuant to CFTC rules.

The Managing Owner, a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading
advisor, is responsible for the cash management activities of the Fund,
including investing in United States Treasury and United States Government
Agencies issues.

In addition, assets of the Fund not required to margin positions may be
maintained in United States bank accounts opened in the name of the Fund and may
be held in United States Treasury bills (or other securities approved by the
CFTC for investment of customer funds).

The Fund receives 100% of the interest income earned on its fixed income assets.


The Fund constitutes a relatively new type of investment vehicle. The Fund
competes with other financial vehicles, including other commodity pools, hedge
funds, traditional debt and equity securities issued by companies in the
commodities industry, other securities backed by or linked to such commodities,
and direct investments in the underlying commodities or commodity futures
contracts. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the 
Managing Owner’s control, may make it more attractive to invest in other 
financial vehicles or to invest in such commodities directly, which could limit 
the market for the Shares and reduce the liquidity of the Shares.


Company Description
PowerShares DB Multi-Sector Commodity Trust, or the Trust, was formed as a
Delaware statutory trust, in seven separate series, or funds, on August 3, 2006.
PowerShares DB Silver Fund, or the Fund, is a series of the Trust. The Fund
issues common units of beneficial interest, or Shares, which


 represent units of
fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Fund. The term
of the Trust and the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain
circumstances).

The Trust was organized in separate series as a Delaware statutory trust rather
than as separate statutory trusts in order to achieve certain administrative
efficiencies. The interests of investors are not adversely affected by the
choice of form of organization. As of the date of this Prospectus, the Trust
consists of the following seven series – PowerShares DB Energy Fund, PowerShares
DB Oil Fund, PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund, PowerShares DB Gold Fund,
PowerShares DB Silver Fund, PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund and PowerShares DB
Agriculture Fund. This Prospectus is for the Fund only and not for the first
6 funds listed in the prior sentence, or the Sectors Funds. The Sectors Funds,
which are series of the Trust, are not being offered by this Prospectus.
---

The Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of
the DBIQ Optimum Yield Silver Index Excess Return™, or the Index, over time,
plus the excess, if any, of the Fund’s interest income from its holdings of
United States Treasury and other high credit quality short-term fixed income
securities over its expenses. The Shares are designed for investors who want a
cost-effective and convenient way to invest in commodity futures on U.S. and
non-U.S. markets.

Advantages of investing in the Shares include:

• Ease and Flexibility of Investment. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca and 
  provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to        
  commodity futures markets. The Shares may be bought and sold on the NYSE  
  Arca like other exchange-listed securities. Retail investors may purchase 
  and sell Shares through traditional brokerage accounts.                   

• Margin. Shares are eligible for margin accounts.

• Diversification. The Shares may help to diversify a portfolio because     
  historically the Index has tended to exhibit low to negative correlation  
  with both equities and conventional bonds and positive correlation to     
  inflation.                                                                

• Optimum Yield™. The Shares seek to track the Index, which employs the     
  Optimum Yield™ rolling methodology, which seeks to minimize the effects of
  negative roll yield that may be experienced by conventional commodities   
  indexes.                                                                  

• Transparency. The Shares provide a more direct investment in commodities  
  than mutual funds that invest in commodity-linked notes, which have       
  implicit imbedded costs and credit risk.                                  

Investing in the Shares does not insulate Shareholders from certain risks,
including price volatility.

The Fund is designed to track the DBIQ Optimum Yield Silver Index Excess Return™
(DBIQ-OY SI ER™), which is intended to reflect the changes in market value of
silver. The single Index Commodity consists of Silver.

If the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it
has become impracticable or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full
or partial exposure to the Index Commodity by investing in a specific futures
contract that comprises the Index, the Fund may invest in a futures contract
referencing the Index Commodity other than the specific contract that comprises
the Index or, in the alternative, invest in other futures contracts not based 
on the Index Commodity if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the 
Managing Owner, such futures contracts tend to exhibit trading prices that 
correlate with the futures contract that comprises the Index.

The Index Sponsor calculates the Index on both an excess return basis and a
total return basis. The excess return basis calculation reflects the change in
market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the underlying
commodity futures only. The total return basis calculation reflects the sum of
the change in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the
underlying commodity futures plus the return on 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The
Fund seeks to track changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of its
Index over time, plus the excess, if any, of its interest income from its
holdings of United States Treasury and other high credit quality short-term
fixed income securities over its expenses.

The Fund will make distributions at the discretion of the Managing Owner. To the
extent that the Fund’s actual and projected interest income from its holdings of
United States Treasury securities and other high credit quality short-term fixed
income securities exceeds the actual and projected fees and expenses of the
Fund, the Managing Owner expects periodically to make distributions of the
amount of such excess. The Fund currently does not expect to make distributions
with respect to capital gains. Depending on the Fund’s performance for the
taxable year and your own tax situation for such year, your income tax liability
for the taxable year for your allocable share of the Fund’s net ordinary income
or loss and capital gain or loss may exceed any distributions you receive with
respect to such year.

The Fund’s portfolio also will include United States Treasury securities and
other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities for deposit with
the Fund’s Commodity Broker as margin.

Services LLC, 60 Wall Street, New York, New York 10005, and the telephone number
of each of them is (212) 250-5883. The Managing Owner’s website: www.dbxus.com.

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

	


	(1) The Value of
	the Shares Relates Directly to the Value of the Futures Contracts and Other Assets Held by the Fund and Fluctuations in the Price of These Assets Could Materially Adversely Affect an Investment in the Funds Shares.






	 




	The Shares are designed to reflect as closely
	as possible the changes, positive or negative, in the level of the Index, over time, through its portfolio of exchange traded futures contracts on the Index Commodity. The value of the Shares relates directly to the value of its portfolio, less the
	liabilities (including estimated accrued but unpaid expenses) of the Fund. The price of the Index Commodity may fluctuate widely. Several factors may affect the prices of the Index Commodity, including, but not limited to:




	 






	 




	



	 




	Global supply and demand of the Index Commodity which may be influenced by such factors as forward selling by the various commodities producers,
	purchases made by the commodities producers to unwind their hedge positions and production and cost levels in the major markets of the Index Commodity;







	 






	 




	



	 




	Domestic and foreign interest rates and investors expectations concerning interest rates;







	 






	 




	



	 




	Domestic and foreign inflation rates and investors expectations concerning inflation rates;







	 






	 




	



	 




	Investment and trading activities of mutual funds, hedge funds and commodity funds; and







	 






	 




	



	 




	Global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations.







	 




	Effective as of August 15, 2014, the
	daily London silver fix, or the London Silver Fix, which has served as a global benchmark, will be replaced by an electronic silver benchmark operated by the CME Group and Thomson Reuters, or the Replacement Silver Fix. The CME Group will provide
	the pricing and Thomson Reuters will provide the administration and the governance for the Replacement Silver Fix.




	 




	As of the date of this Prospectus, the Fund invests in silver futures contracts that trade on the CME. According to the
	rules associated with these silver futures contracts, the silver that underlies these futures contracts must be silver that is produced by a list of specific producers. To the extent that these approved producers rely upon the Replacement Silver Fix
	on and after August 15, 2014 with respect to the pricing of silver, the value of the Funds silver futures contracts and the value of the shares of the Fund may be affected adversely to the extent that the Replacement Silver Fix
	experiences unexpected issues or has inherent design flaws, if any.

	Footnotes to
	Performance Information





	 




	1.
	Aggregate Gross Capital Subscriptions is the aggregate of all amounts ever contributed to the relevant pool, including investors who subsequently redeemed their investments.




	 




	2. Net Asset Value is the net asset value of the pool as of May 31, 2014.




	 




	3. Net Asset Value per
	Share is the Net Asset Value of the pool divided by the total number of Shares outstanding with respect the pool as of May 31, 2014.




	 




	4. Worst Monthly Drawdown is the largest single month loss sustained since inception of trading.
	Drawdown as used in this section of the Prospectus means losses experienced by the pool over the specified period and is calculated on a rate of return basis, i.e., dividing net performance by beginning equity. Drawdown is
	measured on the basis of monthly returns only, and does not reflect intra-month figures. Month is the month of the Worst Monthly Drawdown.




	 




	5. Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown is the largest percentage decline in the Net Asset Value per Share over the
	history of the pool. This need not be a continuous decline, but can be a series of positive and negative returns where the negative returns are larger than the positive returns. Worst Peak-to-Valley Drawdown represents the greatest
	percentage decline from any month-end Net Asset Value per Share that occurs without such month-end Net Asset Value per Share being equaled or exceeded as of a subsequent month-end. For example, if the Net Asset Value per Share of a the pool declined
	by $1 in each of January and February, increased by $1 in March and declined again by $2 in April, a peak-to-valley drawdown analysis conducted as of the end of April would consider that drawdown to be still continuing and to
	be $3 in amount, whereas if the Net Asset Value per Share had increased by $2 in March, the January-February drawdown would have ended as of the end of February at the $2 level.




	 




	6. Compound Rate of Return of
	the relevant is calculated by multiplying on a compound basis each of the monthly rates of return set forth in the chart above and not by adding or averaging such monthly rates of return. For periods of less than one year, the results are
	year-to-date.

	The

	2010 reflects the date on which each Original Index changed its name as reflected in the Renamed Index column above and such change and became effective in January 3, 2011. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, all prior
	underlying formulae, data (e.g., closing levels, measure of volatility, all other numerical statistics and measures) and all other characteristics (e.g., Base Date, Index Sponsor, Inception Date, rolling, etc.) with respect to each Original Index is
	identical to its corresponding Renamed Index.

	Silver Spot Fix pm is, as of the date of this Supplement, an internationally published benchmark for silver and is available through The
	London Bullion Market Associations (the LBMA) website at http://www.lbma.org.uk/pages/index.cfm?page_id=54&title=silver_fixings. The fixings are fully transparent and are therefore used to determine the accepted average price
	of silver. As a benchmark, many other financial instruments (such as cash-settled swaps and options) are priced off the fixing. The silver fixing started in 1897. Three market making members of the LBMA conduct the Silver Fixing meeting under the
	chairmanship of The Bank of Nova Scotia-ScotiaMocatta by telephone at 12.00 noon each working day. The other two members of the Silver Fixing are Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Bank USA, NA. Effective as of August 14, 2014, it is expected that the
	Silver Spot Fix pm, which has served as a global benchmark, will be discontinued. As of the date of this Supplement, it is currently unknown whether the Silver Spot Fix pm will be replaced with a comparable benchmark.

	Annualized Changes to Index Level reflect the change to the applicable index level on an annual basis as of December 31 of each
	applicable year.

	Average rolling 3 month daily volatility. The daily volatility reflects the relative rate at which the price of the applicable index
	moves up and down, which is found by calculating the annualized standard deviation of the daily change in price. In turn, an average of this value is calculated on a 3 month rolling basis.







	 






	13.





	Sharpe Ratio compares the annualized rate of return minus the annualized risk-free rate of return to the annualized
	variabilityoften referred to as the standard deviationof the monthly rates of return. A Sharpe Ratio of 1:1 or higher indicates that, according to the measures used in calculating the ratio, the rate of return achieved by a
	particular strategy has equaled or exceeded the risks assumed by such strategy. The risk-free rate of return that was used in these calculations was assumed to be 3.03%.

	Annualized Index Levels reflect the change to the level of the applicable index on an annual basis as of December 31 of each
	applicable time period (e.g., 1 year, 3, 5 or 7, 10 or 15 years, as applicable).







	 




	WHILE THE FUNDS OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO GENERATE PROFIT THROUGH ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, BUT IS TO TRACK THE INDEX, BECAUSE THE INDEX WAS ESTABLISHED IN JUNE 2006 (RENAMED OCTOBER 2010), CERTAIN
	INFORMATION RELATING TO INDEX CLOSING LEVELS MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE HYPOTHETICAL. HYPOTHETICAL INFORMATION MAY HAVE CERTAIN INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.




	 




	NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT THE INDEX WILL OR IS
	LIKELY TO ACHIEVE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE CLOSING LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH OR SIMILAR TO THOSE SET FORTH HEREIN.




	 




	-14-







	SIMILARLY, NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT THE FUND WILL GENERATE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THE FUNDS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHEN AVAILABLE, OR THE HISTORICAL ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE
	CHANGES IN THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HYPOTHETICAL RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY INVESTMENT METHODOLOGIES, WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE.




	 




	ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL INFORMATION IS THAT IT
	IS GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. TO THE EXTENT THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN RELATES TO THE PERIOD DECEMBER 1988 THROUGH MAY 2006, THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS REFLECT THE APPLICATION OF THE INDEXS METHODOLOGY, AND
	SELECTION OF INDEX COMMODITIES, IN HINDSIGHT.




	 




	NO
	HYPOTHETICAL RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER THE RISKS YOU FACE HEREIN, RELATED TO THE COMMODITIES MARKETS IN
	GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNDS EFFORTS TO TRACK ITS INDEX OVER TIME WHICH CANNOT BE, AND HAVE NOT BEEN, ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF SUCH INDEX INFORMATION SET FORTH ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES, ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY
	AFFECT ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS FOR THE FUND. FURTHERMORE, THE INDEX INFORMATION DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL RISK OR ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FUND.




	 




	THE MANAGING OWNER COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN JANUARY 2006. AS MANAGING OWNER, THE MANAGING OWNER AND ITS TRADING
	PRINCIPALS HAVE BEEN MANAGING THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS FOR THE FUND AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND MANAGING FUTURES TRADING ACCOUNTS. BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED ACTUAL TRADING RESULTS TO COMPARE TO THE INDEX CLOSING LEVELS SET FORTH HEREIN, PROSPECTIVE
	INVESTORS SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY WARY OF PLACING UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE ANNUAL OR CUMULATIVE INDEX RESULTS.




	 




	ALTHOUGH THE INDEX SPONSOR WILL OBTAIN INFORMATION FOR INCLUSION IN OR FOR USE IN THE CALCULATION OF THE INDEX FROM SOURCE(S) WHICH THE
	INDEX SPONSOR CONSIDERS RELIABLE, THE INDEX SPONSOR WILL NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY SUCH INFORMATION AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. THE INDEX SPONSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE (WHETHER
	IN NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY ERROR IN THE INDEX AND THE INDEX SPONSOR IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ADVISE ANY PERSON OF ANY ERROR THEREIN.




	 




	UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, NO TRANSACTION RELATING TO THE INDEX IS SPONSORED, ENDORSED, SOLD OR PROMOTED BY THE INDEX SPONSOR AND THE
	INDEX SPONSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO (A) THE ADVISABILITY OF PURCHASING OR ASSUMING ANY RISK IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH TRANSACTION (B) THE LEVELS AT WHICH THE INDEX STANDS AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME
	ON ANY PARTICULAR DATE (C) THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY THE ISSUER OF ANY SECURITY OR ANY COUNTERPARTY OR ANY SUCH ISSUERS SECURITY HOLDERS OR CUSTOMERS OR ANY SUCH COUNTERPARTYS CUSTOMERS OR COUNTERPARTIES OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR
	ENTITY FROM THE USE OF THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LICENSED RIGHTS OR FOR ANY OTHER USE OR (D) ANY OTHER MATTER. THE INDEX SPONSOR MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR
	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN.




	 




	WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE INDEX SPONSOR HAVE ANY LIABILITY (WHETHER IN NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL
	OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
