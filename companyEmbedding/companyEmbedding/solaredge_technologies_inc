					Full Description



SolarEdge Technologies, Inc., incorporated on August 7, 2006, offers an inverter solution for a solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The Company's products include SolarEdge Power Optimizer, SolarEdge Inverter, StorEdge Solutions and SolarEdge Monitoring Software. Its product roadmap consists of categories, including power optimizers, inverters, monitoring services, energy storage and smart energy management. The Company's power optimizers provide module-level maximum power point (MPP) tracking and real-time adjustments of current and voltage to the optimal working point of each individual PV module. This enables each PV module to continuously produce its maximum power potential independent of other modules in the same string, thus minimizing module mismatch and partial shading losses. By performing these adjustments at a high rate, its power optimizers also solve the dynamic MPP losses associated with traditional inverters. The Company's solution consists of a direct current (DC) power optimizer, an inverter and a cloud-based monitoring platform that operates as a single integrated system.SolarEdge Power OptimizerThe Company's DC power optimizer is a DC-to-DC converter, which is connected by installers to each PV module or embedded by PV module manufacturers into their modules as part of the manufacturing process. Its power optimizer increases energy output from the PV module to which it is connected by continuously tracking the MPP of each module and controlling its working point. The power optimizer's ability to track the MPP of each PV module and its ability to increase or decrease its output voltage, enables the inverter's input voltage to remain fixed under a range of string configurations. The Company's power optimizers monitor the performance of each PV module and communicate this data to its inverter using its power line communication. The inverter transmits this information to its monitoring server.SolarEdge InverterThe Company's DC-to-alternating current (AC) inverters contain digital control technology with power conversion architecture. A power line communication receiver is integrated into each inverter, receiving data from its power optimizers, storing this data and transmitting it to its monitoring server when an Internet connection exists. The Company offers its second generation of inverters, which come in models, including a one-phase inverter designed to address the residential market (2.2 kilowatts (kW) to 11.4 kW), and a three-phase inverter designed to address the residential market in certain European countries and the commercial market (4 kW to 33.3 kW). It also offers an extended commercial solution that consists of various inverters, sized 25 kW, 27.6 kW and 33.3 kW for the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets, and 14.4 kW and 33.3 kW for the North American market. The Company focuses on development of HD-Wave technology inverter.StorEdge SolutionsThe Company's StorEdge solution is a DC coupled solution. The solution is based on a single inverter for both solar PV and storage. Its StorEdge solution is designed to provide smart energy functions, such as maximizing self-consumption, time-of-use programming for desired hours of the day and home energy backup solutions. With a backup solution, unused solar PV power is stored in a battery and used during a power outage or when solar PV production is insufficient. When there is a power outage, a combination of solar PV power and battery is used to power sources, such as the refrigerator, communication devices, lighting and AC outlets. Its monitoring platform provides visibility into battery status, solar PV production and self-consumption.SolarEdge Monitoring SoftwareThe Company's cloud-based monitoring platform collects power, voltage, current and system data sent from its inverters and power optimizers, and allows users to view the data at the module level, string level, inverter level and system level from any browser or from various smart phones and tablets. The monitoring software continuously analyzes data and flags problems.The Company competes with SMA Solar Technology AG, ABB Ltd., Enphase Energy, Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.

History[edit]
SolarEdge was established in 2006 by Guy Sella, CEO and Chairman, Lior Handelsman, VP of Product Strategy & Business Development, Yoav Galin, VP of R&D, Meir Adest, VP of Core Technologies and Amir Fishelov, Chief Software Architect
The company is venture capital backed and investors include GE Energy Financial Services, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, ORR Partners, Genesis Partners, Walden International, Vertex Venture Capital, JP Asia Capital and Opus Capital Ventures.
At the end of 2009, the company started mass production of its products by electronic manufacturing services provider Flextronics International Ltd.
In 2010, the company shipped an estimated 250,000 power optimizers and 12,000 inverters – amounting to a total generation of 50 megawatts and 70% of the power optimizers market.[4]
In March 2015, SolarEdge had an initial public offering of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share, raising $126 million. The shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “SEDG.” Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank acted as joint book-running managers for the offering.[5]
Tesla SolarEdge Partnership[edit]
In May 2015, SolarEdge partnered with Tesla Motors[6] for the joint development of a photovoltaic (PV) storage and backup power solution for the residential solar market, based on the Powerwall home and industrial battery packs that were unveiled in April 2015.[7] and quickly received orders to a total value of US$800 million.[8]
Using SolarEdge’s Direct current (DC) optimized inverter and Tesla's automotive-grade battery technology, the solution requires only a single SolarEdge inverter to manage both PV and storage functions. The system is designed for efficient, outdoor installation and includes remote monitoring and troubleshooting to keep operations and maintenance costs low.[9]
Technology[edit]
Background[edit]
Traditional PV systems are typically characterized by a centralized inverter or string inverter architecture*. In this topology the inverter performs MPPT for large quantities of solar panels as a whole. Since the solar panels are connected in series to form strings, the same current must flow through all the modules, so the solar inverter continuously adjusts the electric current in the system to find the average optimal working point of all the modules. As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.[2][3]* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,[4] uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle. In addition, power may also be lost due to slow tracking of dynamic weather conditions caused by moving clouds,[5] and on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter’s permissible input voltage range*. These factors cause small losses in yearly yields, but they are present. Other drawbacks of traditional PV systems include:

System design is constrained by the need to match all strings’ length and orientation
Monitoring visibility and fault detection are limited to the inverter (or in some cases, to the string level)
High DC voltage is present as long as the sun is up, posing a possible risk of electrocution to installers, maintenance personnel and firefighters*

These drawbacks, however, can be mitigated by newer string inverters with advanced electronics and features such as dual, shade-tolerant and improved MPPT.
Offering[edit]
SolarEdge delivers a distributed system that tackles the aforementioned challenges. Energy loss due to panel mismatch is prevented by performing MPPT for each panel individually. String voltage is kept fixed at all times, so strings can be combined regardless of length, tilt, or type of panels used. Continuous performance measurement enables online monitoring and fault detection at panel-level. Installer and firefighter safety is enhanced by shutting off the DC voltage whenever the inverter is disconnected. To achieve the above without raising the cost of the system, compared to standard inverters, SolarEdge provides panel optimizers as well as its own inverter and monitoring web portal. The solution is applicable for a wide range of applications, from residential roofs to large scale solar farms.[1]
Products[edit]




SolarEdge power optimizers Wiring Example with a safety monitoring interface mode (SMI) and a standard inverter.






SolarEdge power optimizer 350W. The long wires are used to connect the SolarEdge power optimizers with each other (in series). On the short wires the photovoltaic module is connected.


Power Optimizer[edit]
The SolarEdge Power Optimizer is embedded into each panel by panel manufacturers instead of the junction box*, or retrofitted by PV installers onto regular modules**. The power optimizer optimizes energy output by performing Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) individually for each panel and maintains a fixed DC string voltage*. Power optimizers also collect performance measurements and telemetries of each panel, and transmit the data over existing power lines.
Inverter[edit]
The SolarEdge Solar inverter is responsible for DC to AC inversion while MPPT and voltage management are handled by power optimizers separately for each module. Fixed string voltage ensures operation at the highest efficiency at all times (97% maximum efficiency), independent of string length and temperature. The company offers single-phase inverters with a rated AC power output of between 3,000 and 6,000 watts*, as well as three-phase inverters with a rated AC power output ranging between 7,000 and 17,000
Monitoring Portal[edit]
Web-based and smartphone (both IoS and Android) applications provide module-level*, string-level* and system-wide PV Monitoring. The software provides alerts on a wide range of issues affecting energy generation that might otherwise go undetected*. Data and alerts are presented on a virtual site map and can be pinpointed to specific location to reduce maintenance time and costs.
Installer Tools[edit]
SolarEdge provides a set of freeware software tools with its products. The Site Designer recommends string layout and inverter and power optimizer selection, according to the site’s size. The Configuration Tool allows remote configuration of the SolarEdge inverter* as well as real-time, on-site verification of correct installation, and the iPhone Site Mapping Tool application, allows for swift and easy creations of a virtual map of the PV site*.
Awards[edit]
SolarEdge was notably honored by receiving the following awards:

Red Herring: "100 Global Award 2010" (1/2011)[10]
Red Herring: "100 Europe Award" (5/2010)[11]
AlwaysOn: SolarEdge named a "2010 GoingGreen East Top 50" company (3/2010)[12]
Fast Company Magazine: SolarEdge named a "2010 World Top Ten Innovative Energy" company (2/2010)[13]

History[edit]
SolarEdge was established in 2006 by Guy Sella, CEO and Chairman, Lior Handelsman, VP of Product Strategy & Business Development, Yoav Galin, VP of R&D, Meir Adest, VP of Core Technologies and Amir Fishelov, Chief Software Architect
The company is venture capital backed and investors include GE Energy Financial Services, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, ORR Partners, Genesis Partners, Walden International, Vertex Venture Capital, JP Asia Capital and Opus Capital Ventures.
At the end of 2009, the company started mass production of its products by electronic manufacturing services provider Flextronics International Ltd.
In 2010, the company shipped an estimated 250,000 power optimizers and 12,000 inverters – amounting to a total generation of 50 megawatts and 70% of the power optimizers market.[4]
In March 2015, SolarEdge had an initial public offering of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share, raising $126 million. The shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “SEDG.” Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank acted as joint book-running managers for the offering.[5]
Tesla SolarEdge Partnership[edit]
In May 2015, SolarEdge partnered with Tesla Motors[6] for the joint development of a photovoltaic (PV) storage and backup power solution for the residential solar market, based on the Powerwall home and industrial battery packs that were unveiled in April 2015.[7] and quickly received orders to a total value of US$800 million.[8]
Using SolarEdge’s Direct current (DC) optimized inverter and Tesla's automotive-grade battery technology, the solution requires only a single SolarEdge inverter to manage both PV and storage functions. The system is designed for efficient, outdoor installation and includes remote monitoring and troubleshooting to keep operations and maintenance costs low.[9]
Technology[edit]
Background[edit]
Traditional PV systems are typically characterized by a centralized inverter or string inverter architecture*. In this topology the inverter performs MPPT for large quantities of solar panels as a whole. Since the solar panels are connected in series to form strings, the same current must flow through all the modules, so the solar inverter continuously adjusts the electric current in the system to find the average optimal working point of all the modules. As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.[2][3]* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,[4] uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle. In addition, power may also be lost due to slow tracking of dynamic weather conditions caused by moving clouds,[5] and on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter’s permissible input voltage range*. These factors cause small losses in yearly yields, but they are present. Other drawbacks of traditional PV systems include:

System design is constrained by the need to match all strings’ length and orientation
Monitoring visibility and fault detection are limited to the inverter (or in some cases, to the string level)
High DC voltage is present as long as the sun is up, posing a possible risk of electrocution to installers, maintenance personnel and firefighters*

These drawbacks, however, can be mitigated by newer string inverters with advanced electronics and features such as dual, shade-tolerant and improved MPPT.
Offering[edit]
SolarEdge delivers a distributed system that tackles the aforementioned challenges. Energy loss due to panel mismatch is prevented by performing MPPT for each panel individually. String voltage is kept fixed at all times, so strings can be combined regardless of length, tilt, or type of panels used. Continuous performance measurement enables online monitoring and fault detection at panel-level. Installer and firefighter safety is enhanced by shutting off the DC voltage whenever the inverter is disconnected. To achieve the above without raising the cost of the system, compared to standard inverters, SolarEdge provides panel optimizers as well as its own inverter and monitoring web portal. The solution is applicable for a wide range of applications, from residential roofs to large scale solar farms.[1]
Products[edit]




SolarEdge power optimizers Wiring Example with a safety monitoring interface mode (SMI) and a standard inverter.






SolarEdge power optimizer 350W. The long wires are used to connect the SolarEdge power optimizers with each other (in series). On the short wires the photovoltaic module is connected.


Power Optimizer[edit]
The SolarEdge Power Optimizer is embedded into each panel by panel manufacturers instead of the junction box*, or retrofitted by PV installers onto regular modules**. The power optimizer optimizes energy output by performing Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) individually for each panel and maintains a fixed DC string voltage*. Power optimizers also collect performance measurements and telemetries of each panel, and transmit the data over existing power lines.
Inverter[edit]
The SolarEdge Solar inverter is responsible for DC to AC inversion while MPPT and voltage management are handled by power optimizers separately for each module. Fixed string voltage ensures operation at the highest efficiency at all times (97% maximum efficiency), independent of string length and temperature. The company offers single-phase inverters with a rated AC power output of between 3,000 and 6,000 watts*, as well as three-phase inverters with a rated AC power output ranging between 7,000 and 17,000
Monitoring Portal[edit]
Web-based and smartphone (both IoS and Android) applications provide module-level*, string-level* and system-wide PV Monitoring. The software provides alerts on a wide range of issues affecting energy generation that might otherwise go undetected*. Data and alerts are presented on a virtual site map and can be pinpointed to specific location to reduce maintenance time and costs.
Installer Tools[edit]
SolarEdge provides a set of freeware software tools with its products. The Site Designer recommends string layout and inverter and power optimizer selection, according to the site’s size. The Configuration Tool allows remote configuration of the SolarEdge inverter* as well as real-time, on-site verification of correct installation, and the iPhone Site Mapping Tool application, allows for swift and easy creations of a virtual map of the PV site*.
Awards[edit]
SolarEdge was notably honored by receiving the following awards:

Red Herring: "100 Global Award 2010" (1/2011)[10]
Red Herring: "100 Europe Award" (5/2010)[11]
AlwaysOn: SolarEdge named a "2010 GoingGreen East Top 50" company (3/2010)[12]
Fast Company Magazine: SolarEdge named a "2010 World Top Ten Innovative Energy" company (2/2010)[13]
Frost & Sullivan: "2009 European Solar Photovoltaic Hot Investment Opportunity Award” (9/2009)[1]
The Guardian and Cleantech Group: SolarEdge named a "Global Cleantech 100" company (9/2009)[14]

As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.[2][3]* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,[4] uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle. In addition, power may also be lost due to slow tracking of dynamic weather conditions caused by moving clouds,[5] and on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter’s permissible input voltage range*. These factors cause small losses in yearly yields, but they are present. Other drawbacks of traditional PV systems include:

System design is constrained by the need to match all strings’ length and orientation
Monitoring visibility and fault detection are limited to the inverter (or in some cases, to the string level)
High DC voltage is present as long as the sun is up, posing a possible risk of electrocution to installers, maintenance personnel and firefighters*

These drawbacks, however, can be mitigated by newer string inverters with advanced electronics and features such as dual, shade-tolerant and improved MPPT.
Offering[edit]
SolarEdge delivers a distributed system that tackles the aforementioned challenges. Energy loss due to panel mismatch is prevented by performing MPPT for each panel individually. String voltage is kept fixed at all times, so strings can be combined regardless of length, tilt, or type of panels used. Continuous performance measurement enables online monitoring and fault detection at panel-level. Installer and firefighter safety is enhanced by shutting off the DC voltage whenever the inverter is disconnected. To achieve the above without raising the cost of the system, compared to standard inverters, SolarEdge provides panel optimizers as well as its own inverter and monitoring web portal. The solution is applicable for a wide range of applications, from residential roofs to large scale solar farms.[1]
Products[edit]




SolarEdge power optimizers Wiring Example with a safety monitoring interface mode (SMI) and a standard inverter.






SolarEdge power optimizer 350W. The long wires are used to connect the SolarEdge power optimizers with each other (in series). On the short wires the photovoltaic module is connected.


Power Optimizer[edit]
The SolarEdge Power Optimizer is embedded into each panel by panel manufacturers instead of the junction box*, or retrofitted by PV installers onto regular modules**. The power optimizer optimizes energy output by performing Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) individually for each panel and maintains a fixed DC string voltage*. Power optimizers also collect performance measurements and telemetries of each panel, and transmit the data over existing power lines.
Inverter[edit]
The SolarEdge Solar inverter is responsible for DC to AC inversion while MPPT and voltage management are handled by power optimizers separately for each module. Fixed string voltage ensures operation at the highest efficiency at all times (97% maximum efficiency), independent of string length and temperature. The company offers single-phase inverters with a rated AC power output of between 3,000 and 6,000 watts*, as well as three-phase inverters with a rated AC power output ranging between 7,000 and 17,000
Monitoring Portal[edit]
Web-based and smartphone (both IoS and Android) applications provide module-level*, string-level* and system-wide PV Monitoring. The software provides alerts on a wide range of issues affecting energy generation that might otherwise go undetected*. Data and alerts are presented on a virtual site map and can be pinpointed to specific location to reduce maintenance time and costs.
Installer Tools[edit]
SolarEdge provides a set of freeware software tools with its products. The Site Designer recommends string layout and inverter and power optimizer selection, according to the site’s size. The Configuration Tool allows remote configuration of the SolarEdge inverter* as well as real-time, on-site verification of correct installation, and the iPhone Site Mapping Tool application, allows for swift and easy creations of a virtual map of the PV site*.
Awards[edit]
SolarEdge was notably honored by receiving the following awards:

Red Herring: "100 Global Award 2010" (1/2011)[10]
Red Herring: "100 Europe Award" (5/2010)[11]

History[edit]
SolarEdge was established in 2006 by Guy Sella, CEO and Chairman, Lior Handelsman, VP of Product Strategy & Business Development, Yoav Galin, VP of R&D, Meir Adest, VP of Core Technologies and Amir Fishelov, Chief Software Architect
The company is venture capital backed and investors include GE Energy Financial Services, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, ORR Partners, Genesis Partners, Walden International, Vertex Venture Capital, JP Asia Capital and Opus Capital Ventures.
At the end of 2009, the company started mass production of its products by electronic manufacturing services provider Flextronics International Ltd.
In 2010, the company shipped an estimated 250,000 power optimizers and 12,000 inverters – amounting to a total generation of 50 megawatts and 70% of the power optimizers market.[4]
In March 2015, SolarEdge had an initial public offering of 7,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $18.00 per share, raising $126 million. The shares began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “SEDG.” Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank acted as joint book-running managers for the offering.[5]
Tesla SolarEdge Partnership[edit]
In May 2015, SolarEdge partnered with Tesla Motors[6] for the joint development of a photovoltaic (PV) storage and backup power solution for the residential solar market, based on the Powerwall home and industrial battery packs that were unveiled in April 2015.[7] and quickly received orders to a total value of US$800 million.[8]
Using SolarEdge’s Direct current (DC) optimized inverter and Tesla's automotive-grade battery technology, the solution requires only a single SolarEdge inverter to manage both PV and storage functions. The system is designed for efficient, outdoor installation and includes remote monitoring and troubleshooting to keep operations and maintenance costs low.[9]
Technology[edit]
Background[edit]
Traditional PV systems are typically characterized by a centralized inverter or string inverter architecture*. In this topology the inverter performs MPPT for large quantities of solar panels as a whole. Since the solar panels are connected in series to form strings, the same current must flow through all the modules, so the solar inverter continuously adjusts the electric current in the system to find the average optimal working point of all the modules. As a result, potential power may be lost whenever a mismatch exists between modules.[2][3]* Panel mismatch is unavoidable in many cases, due to panel manufacturing tolerance, partial shading,[4] uneven soiling, or uneven tilt angle. In addition, power may also be lost due to slow tracking of dynamic weather conditions caused by moving clouds,[5] and on extremely hot or cold days when the system DC voltage may exceed the inverter’s permissible input voltage range*. These factors cause small losses in yearly yields, but they are present. Other drawbacks of traditional PV systems include:

SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. Key Developments

SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. Launches First PV Inverter-Integrated Electric Vehicle Charger
Jul 11 17
SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. is unveiling the inverter-integrated electric vehicle charger. By supplementing grid power with PV power, SolarEdge’s Level 2 EV charger offers charging up to six times faster than a standard Level 1 charger with its innovative solar boost mode. SolarEdge’s HD-Wave inverter, once integrated with an EV charger, will not only provide the existing management and monitoring of solar production, but will also enable EV charging from a single inverter and dashboard. The combined solution will offer considerable cost savings on both hardware and labor by eliminating the need for an additional conduit, wiring, and breaker installation. The solution will also eliminate the need for an additional dedicated circuit breaker, which saves space and a potential main distribution panel upgrade. Based on patent-pending technology, the EV charger is embedded into SolarEdge’s HD-Wave inverter and leverages its solar boost mode. This mode utilizes both grid and PV to charge at 9.6kW (40 Amp) Level 2 charging, which is up to six times faster than standard Level 1 charging. If PV is not available, the inverter-integrated EV charger will use grid power to charge at 7.6kW (32 Amp) Level 2 charging, which is up to five times faster than standard Level 1 charging. With a 12-year warranty, the inverter-integrated EV charger offers potential future operating modes, such as demand-response and charging at off-peak hours to optimize Time-of-Use (TOU) rates. The inverter-integrated EV charger is expected to be available in the last quarter of 2017.

forrest , CAExcellent Technology and CompanyWe had already gotten quotes from four different companies (two possibles, two obvious no-go''s) when a neighbor said we MUST talk to Vince at Jamar Power before signing with anyone else.  We were immediately impressed with Jamar: Vince outlined a SolarEdge system that suited us perfectly, answered all our questions and concerns thoroughly and with great patience. We liked that Jamar has a long history in the electrical business and does not subcontract out the work, like many do.  We''re old enough to have seen a few economic cycles, and it seems likely that many of today''s opportunistic solar companies will disappear after 2016.  Jamar has been successful in the electrical business for many years, and is likely to continue for many more.  I''m a geek, and I found the technical stuff fascinating. The SolarEdge system has the advantages of both string and microinverter systems, at reasonable cost, with the MPPT work being done on the roof by intelligent power optimizers, which are very efficient (see Wikipedia on buck-boost converters for more).  The optimizers feed DC power to a string inverter, keeping all the more fragile components in a more sheltered environment off the roof.   My experience with electronics makes me skeptical about longevity claims for the electrolytic capacitors in roof-mounted microinverters.  SolarEdge looks to be a well-run, well-capitalized company that is likely to be in business for many years.  We went with 24 LG305 panels with SolarEdge power optimizers and SE7600 inverter, a 7.32 kW system adequate to handle our pool and a/c needs.  Panel-level monitoring is provided, so you can show off at lunchtime with your cellphone, or monitor from your desktop PC.  Installation dovetailed perfectly with replacement of our aging roof (our roofer Mark Anthony Construction and Roofing, is also a class act that I highly recommend), so the whole project, roof and solar, was all done in 8 days!  Everything went perfectly! Because our breaker box was maxxed out, Jamar installed an extra electrical sub-panel at no extra cost.  Everything was done quickly, neatly, no muss, no fuss, and no mess. They explained every component of the system and how to operate it all.   Everything looked great when they finished, and of course it passed inspection.  We were approved and making power two weeks from when they had started work, and less than six weeks after signing a contract, in time to turn the summer sun into money, and be grandfathered into net metering.  I just can''t say enough about how smoothly and perfectly everything went!  We''re usually a little apprehensive about home projects, but this could not have gone better! Jamar Power is an excellent company and I would recommend them to anyone!... (more)Type: OtherReviewed: 08/07/2015ExcellentSolarPlusAuberry & Fresno, CAExcellent Product and ServiceWe started using SolarEdge early in 2014 and we far prefer it to the micros or standard SMA''s.  We can see the difference by watching the monitoring of how Solar Edge gets a little more out of each panel because of it''s design.   We had a problem on a weekend and they got back to us in a timely manner.... (more)Type: OtherReviewed: 02/06/2015ExcellentCasey , GAOverall good productThey have a great monitoring portal. The optimzers install easily. I like how they communicate with the inverter over the power wires. I wish the inverter had to ability to detect Wifi and connect instead of running a data cable to the router. I''d also prefer the AC/DC disconnect to be made of metal and allow the installer to put knockouts only where they are needed. Overall its a good product and I use them on most of my installations now.... (more)Type: OtherReviewed: 12/23/2014GoodCJ SianoBolton, MAGreat power inversion designAn inverter is the most efficient when the input and output voltages are constant.  The SolarEdge design uses a DC/DC converter at each panel (called a Power Optimizer) that works with all the panels in the string to provide a very narrow variance of voltage to the inverter.  The inverter then only needs to convert that very steady DC voltage to AC voltage.  Very efficient and very effective.  If panels are shaded, the Power Optimizers reconfigure their outputs so that the combined voltage is roughly 350 volts  The end result being that an output drop on one or more panels does not impact the overall effectiveness of the others.  The result is that I get great power even as the clouds pass by.  Best of all, the inverter talks to the Power Optimizers over the power cables so that specific panel outputs are known and monitored.    Built-in monitoring by direct web connection is a nice feature too.  All inverters should be this sophisticated.... (more)Type: OtherReviewed: 10/17/2014Excellent

Design guy...  Great product - Horrible Support!Wow really great and easy to install. As an Owner builder this is an easy task really!  But I have a few items to warn you about...  The locations of the knockouts on the inverter case are a little awkward and with the invert er mounted off the wall about 4" made for a-lot of fitting work to bring power to the  AC/ DC connections.   Inverter is really easy to install otherwise...   Optimizer are simple. ... Once all connected and running I had an issue with one optimizer and need a replacement.... it took customer -no support  three days to get back to me.... and now after more than a week with a non-functioning panel ( because of the bad opt)  I still have not heard anything.   I might just have to buy a new unit and wait until they finally get around to me....

Slingshot Power did the installation in a day which was impressive given the large system size.  Inverter hangs nicely in my garage and the asthetics are great.    A fair amount of early morning and early evening shade but the systems is doing a fantastic job of harvesting power even when some of the panels are partially shaded.  Panel-level monitoring is really nice as I get a birds-eye view into how each module is working.  iPhone APP is nice when I need brag to my friends with old string inverters that have no monitoring.  I was quoted the same price for a system with an SMA inverter and $2,500 more for a system with Enphase micros.  No brainer to use SolarEdge over SMA given all the features.  I researched Enphase and learned about all the failures so I did not like the prospect of trying to remove these from behind the panel in the coming years.  Also, the system is completely expandable so I can add another array in the future if my energy needs go up.  All in all, I am happy with the install and support from Slingshot with a nice inverter from SolarEdge....

Inverters

SolarEdge PV Inverter
The SolarEdge DC-AC PV inverter is specifically designed to work with the SolarEdge power optimizers. Because MPPT and voltage management are handled separately for each module by the power optimizer, the inverter is only responsible for DC to AC inversion. Consequently, it is a less complicated, more cost effective, more reliable solar inverter with a standard 12 year warranty, extendable to 20 or 25 years. The fixed string voltage ensures operation at the highest efficiency at all times (>97% weighted efficiency) independent of string length and temperature. Available from:

Power Optimizer




 The SolarEdge power optimizer is a DC/DC converter which is connected by installers to each PV module or embedded by module manufacturers, replacing the traditional solar junction box. The SolarEdge power optimizers increase energy output from PV systems by constantly tracking the maximum power point (MPPT) of each module individually. Furthermore, the power optimizers monitor the performance of each module and communicate performance data to the SolarEdge monitoring portal for enhanced, cost-effective module-level maintenance. Each power optimizer is equipped with the unique SafeDC™ feature which automatically shuts down modules' DC voltage whenever the inverter or grid power is shut down.The MPPT per module allows for flexible installation design with multiple orientations, tilts and module types in the same string.  When working with SolarEdge Inverters, SolarEdge power optimizers automatically maintain a fixed string voltage, allowing installers even greater flexibility with longer strings and strings of different lengths in order to design optimal PV systems. The SolarEdge power optimizers are compatible with c-Si and thin-film modules and have a 25 year warranty.The following power optimizer models are available: P-Series Module Add-On Power OptimizerConnected by installers to the PV module and compatible with a wide range of modulesPower Optimizer ModelModule PowerModule Voc P300*                                               ≤300W≤48VP350*≤350W≤60VP370*≤370W≤60VP500*≤500W≤80VP404*≤405W≤80VP405**≤405W≤125V* Also available with frames mounted in advance for quicker installation.

Single Phase Solar Inverters




   The SolarEdge PV inverter combines sophisticated digital control technology with efficient power conversion architecture to achieve superior solar power harvesting and best-in-class reliability. A proprietary data monitoring receiver has been integrated into the single phase solar inverter and aggregates the power optimizer performance data from each PV module. This data can be transmitted to the web and accessed via the SolarEdge monitoring platform for performance analysis, fault detection and troubleshooting of PV systems. The single phase inverter comes with a built-in DC safety switch, integrated rapid shutdown and a standard 12-year warranty.   Single Phase Inverter Feature highlights:Solar inverters specifically designed to work with power optimizers Superior efficiencyExcellent reliability with standard 12-year warranty  (extendable to 20 or 25 years)Small, lightweight and easy to installBuilt-in module-level monitoring  receiverInternet connection through Ethernet or Wireless (Wi-Fi, ZigBee Gateway, Cellular) Optional cellular  connectivityIP65 / NEMA 3R – Outdoor and indoor installationIntegrated arc fault protection and rapid shutdown for NEC 2014 and 2017 690.11 and 690.12Optional integrated revenue grade data, ANSI C12.20All inverters are UL1741 SA certified, for CPUC Rule 21 grid compliance

 HD-Wave – A New Era for PV Inverters: <30 lbs, 99% Efficiency, Integrated Auto Rapid ShutdownSolarEdge's HD-Wave technology inverter, winner of the prestigious 2016 Intersolar award, breaks the mold of traditional inverters. Using a novel power conversion technology that is based on a distributed switching and powerful DSP processing, the HD-Wave technology inverter is able to synthesize a clean sine wave that leads to a dramatic reduction in the magnetics and heavy cooling elements. This small and lightweight inverter enables simplified shipping and storing and one-person installation. The record-breaking efficiency allows more energy production for an improved ROI.
