Welcome to today’s Aviat Networks' Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Glenn Wiener. Please go ahead, sir.
Glenn Wiener
Thank you, operator, and welcome to Aviat Networks' fiscal 2017 second quarter results conference call. We issued our press release after the market closed and posted an updated investor presentation on our website in the Investor Relations section.

Ralph Marimon, our Chief Financial Officer, unfortunately is not able to join us today due to a personal family matter.

At this time, I'd like to thank you all for your interest and support of Aviat.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Mike Pangia. Mike?
Michael Pangia
Thank you, Glenn. I’d also like to thank everyone joining today's call. I'm very happy to report that our second fiscal quarter - that in our second fiscal quarter we were profitable on net income basis both GAAP and non-GAAP. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57 and adjusted EBITDA of just under $5 million, which represents close to a $9 million year-over-year improvement. We also increased our cash by over 3 million sequentially. The strategy we implemented to improve our business has proven to be effective and we are increasingly confident that we can sustain profitability moving forward. Our focus on process improvements and driving efficiencies in our business will continue and we are now in a position to increase our actions towards profitable topline growth. Overall, I'm very proud of our accomplishments as a company and as a team. Although, there is more to do I want to thank all of our employees for seeing our turnaround through and enabling us to achieve these much improved results.
Now let's talk about the quarter. We reported revenue of 68.5 million which was 10.3 million or 17.7% higher than the prior quarter and came within 2.7% on a year-over-year basis. While our book to bill was under 1, it was within our expected range and as I mentioned on our last investor call, bookings will vary from quarter to quarter. This quarter, we reported non-GAAP gross margins of 31.3%, an improvement of 140 basis points sequentially. When comparing to last year’s second quarter, gross margins increased by approximately 800 basis points, higher volumes in North America led to a favorable mix and positively impacted margins, stronger operational execution in our supply chain and services areas also contributed to better performance. And we believe these improvements are sustainable moving forward. Looking ahead, we expect 30% as the new norm for gross margins. So quarters may fluctuate based on mix by approximately 100 basis points on either side.

Non-GAAP operating expenses this quarter came in at $18.1 million, an improvement of 1.6 million over Q1 and 2.9 million over last year's quarter - last year’s second quarter. Of note, our OpEx for the quarter included a bad debt recovery of approximately $750,000 which impacted expenses favorably in Q2. There were also other timing related benefits of approximately 250,000. Notwithstanding these factors, our OpEx was still substantially better sequentially and year over year. Our current quarterly run rate excluding one-time events or any upticks in spending to support growth is approximately 19 to 19.5 million. In terms of profitability, our goal for Q2 was to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA which we did comfortably at 4.8 million. We generated non-GAAP net income of 3.1 million which is Aviat’s single best quarter since the second quarter of fiscal year 2013, four years prior. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of 1.7 million.
Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and our working capital metrics are the best we've seen in years. Our cash position of 35 million grew just over $3 million compared to the fiscal 2017 first quarter. DSOs were down and inventory turns were up. Our team has done a remarkable job and we're positioned to generate cash in the second half of the fiscal year. Moving on to our business and outlook, looking first at North America. We had a strong quarter in North America. The sector represented 57% of our total mix in Q2 compared to 45% in the same quarter a year ago. The result of our consistent success in winning new business especially in private networks. In North America, revenue was up approximately $10 million sequentially. We had seven customers from a variety of utility, state and local government projects that represented more than $1 million each in Q2 revenue as well.
Also since we last reported, we announced two new awards with US federal government agencies and a new agreement with NASPO ValuePoint, the nationwide purchasing arm of NASPO which provides us with greater reach into US state and local government agencies while accelerating the sales process. Q2 revenue from our North American service provider customers remain steady and we expect volume in the near term to remain in the same zone. Our strategy has not changed. We will continue to explore opportunities to participate with other operators that we currently do not do business with, while also investing to support our installed base and ensuring we are well positioned longer term as plans for 5G deployments evolve.
Moving on to the international arena. International revenue for the first half of the fiscal year was down approximately $24 million compared to the same period last year. I would say however that the overall market appears to be stabilizing that is it hasn't gotten any worse than we expected and there are pockets where we are seeing increased activity and new opportunities. Relative to Q1, we saw sequential revenue gains in Africa and Latin America which offset some of the lower volumes throughout Europe and Asia. Business with MTN has picked up and during the second quarter, they remained a 10% plus customer for us. We also announced new business with Airtel Nigeria becoming their countrywide managed service provider for enterprise access. In a challenging environment, we focused on providing outstanding support to our existing customers and as a result we are maintaining our position. We are investing in our technology portfolio to strengthen our competitive position. We will soon unveil some exciting new products that will serve as a catalyst for addressing new customers and markets and support our future growth ambitions.
A few comments on our balance sheet. Our Q2 cash and cash equivalents balance of $35 million was up [indiscernible]. And since fiscal 2016 year end, we've increased our next cash position by 5.5 million. Our cash flow from operations was 5 million in the second quarter and year-to-date was 8.8 million. DSOs continued to improve. DSOs during Q2 were 75 days compared to 78 days in Q1 and 99 days in Q4 of fiscal 2016. DSOs were positively impacted by our higher concentration of North America business along with improved collections internationally. Our inventory position of 23 million is down from 26.9 million reported in Q1 and down 7.3 million compared to our fiscal 2016 year end. We continue to focus on process enhancements related to inventory management and our turns of 8.2 times is a significant improvement over prior quarters. We're very pleased with the progress we are making in working capital management. With the improvement in receivables and inventories, our cash conversion cycle has substantially fallen over the past six months.

Let me now shift to our outlook. In the second half of the fiscal year, we're expecting revenues to be approximately 130 million to 140 million with Q3 in the range of the low to mid-60s and Q4 higher, most likely in excess of 70 million. Relative to last year’s second half, our estimate will yield between 9% and 17% revenue growth. We expect to report positive non-GAAP operating income for the second half of the fiscal year with Q3 coming in near breakeven. We also expect to report positive adjusted EPS in both the fiscal 2017 third and fourth quarters. Lastly, we anticipate a slight cash usage in Q3, due to new programs kicking off internationally, but our cash position is expected to increase in the second half of the fiscal year.
In closing, the strategy we put in place was intended to drive us to profitability this fiscal year. This was achieved in the fiscal second quarter and we believe we're positioned for growth in the second half of the year, while sustaining profitability. We've exceeded our near-term gross margin target and improved our processes and cost structure significantly. We now have a stronger foundation in place with a clear line of sight to drive performance. With profitability achieved and continued balance sheet improvements, we are now shifting towards a growth mindset. We will continue to pursue all strategic avenues that will enhance our offering, market position and valuation. That has not changed. 
Lastly, I want to sincerely thank our shareholders. Achieving profitability in a macro challenged environment has been a difficult task, but we have emerged a stronger company. Many of our shareholders have been very supportive throughout this turnaround process. We're excited with our prospects and looking forward to building on this momentum. Thank you for your continued support.
This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Orin Hirschman from AIGH Investment Partners.
Orin Hirschman
Hi. Congratulations on the terrific results. I know it's been long in coming and you're working very hard. And thank God it's nice, it's very gratifying to see. A quick question just on the actual numbers themselves. The non-GAAP EPS number, that included the -- I want to make sure I know the exact number -- that included roughly $750,000 benefit plus another minor benefit?
Kevin Holwell
That's correct. Yes.
Orin Hirschman
Okay. Do you happen to have the adjusted EPS number without those one-time benefits?
Kevin Holwell
I think it’s about $0.15 per share impact roughly.
Orin Hirschman
Okay. So it would have been $0.42.
Kevin Holwell
That’s correct. Yeah.
Orin Hirschman
Okay. In terms of -- you know, carriers are steady. Any reason to believe that there's any big change in the spending or that's really going to depend on a year or two from now 5G and we're just going to -- more of a steady-state mode? And it's nice to win the Nigerian in -- but is that actually for the carrier or is that for their trying to get corporate customers for private networks? I wasn't clear on that.
Michael Pangia
Yeah. It’s more -- so the enterprise play in Nigeria is more associated with working with the operator to drive business with corporate business, utilizing our solutions. As far as the mobile operator front, I mean we feel very confident that we actually have an opportunity to enter some other operators that we’re currently not doing business with. Having said that, the business will continue to be steady and I wouldn't rule out opportunities for growth within some existing accounts again based on probably more in the position of taking some share from others that are with those customers, not expecting any major uptick in CapEx in the near term, but we definitely anticipate that to be the case in the medium to longer term.

Orin Hirschman
Okay. In terms of the market, it’s really been working so well for you, which is North America, private corporate networks, obviously that's really been great and it gets you in where you do a $60 million or a $70 million fourth quarter. What gets you to the $75 million to $80 million mark, assuming that the carrier world kind of just stays in the doldrums, but steady like you outlined? What's needed to get you even further on the private network side? Or it's just a matter of time?
Michael Pangia
Well, so first I can say that I have a very, very strong funnel of opportunities, which puts us into a, I guess, more an optimistic position on our ability to generate growth moving forward. So it first starts with the line of sight the opportunities that I see that would represent further growth within the private networks vertical. I do want to again go back to what I said earlier, whether it's private networks or mobile and when I talk about mobile, there's different tiers to mobile, everything from the top tier all the way down to lower tier regional providers. We have a lot of opportunity to actually start addressing customers that we haven't really focused on that much in the past that are in some of these two tiers and in some geographies that we haven't really focused on even within private networks and we see a lot of opportunity as I said earlier to actually position ourselves and take share, from others to drive growth. If the overall market picks up, to me, that would even provide further fuel for us to drive growth even further than we anticipate.
Orin Hirschman
Is there anything critical on the new product side?
Michael Pangia
So our current portfolio that we have is very strong. We have a number of dimensions to our offerings that differentiate us from others. So when you look at total cost of ownership and include the services layer, we feel very good about our position. We will be introducing some new products in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for that and we believe that that will be a further catalyst to position us even more favorably and open up additional opportunities on some of the new customers that I highlighted earlier.
Operator

Aviat Networks Appoints Michael Pangia as President & CEO
Chuck Kissner to Continue Chairman Role


SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 18, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Aviat Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: AVNW), a leading provider of wireless transmission solutions, announced that effective today Michael Pangia, who was Aviat Networks' SVP and Chief Sales Officer, has been appointed President & CEO and a member of the Board of Directors. Chuck Kissner will continue as Chairman of the Board of Directors.
Kissner became CEO on June 28, 2010 to lead a transformation of Aviat's business. Pangia has led the Sales and Services operations of the company since he joined in March 2009 and was part of the management team that led the restructuring and turnaround efforts over the past year.
During that time, the company has reduced costs, refocused its business, introduced new products, stabilized its top line, and streamlined operations.
"I'm delighted that the Board has expressed their confidence in me and the management team going forward," said Pangia.  "We made tremendous progress over the last year on many fronts, and believe we are now well-positioned to move Aviat to the next stage.  We now have a company with better operating leverage, a strong pipeline of new products, and an enthusiastic customer base.  I expect the transition to be a smooth one, and look forward to reporting our Q4 FY11 and full year results in August."
"The Aviat Networks team accomplished its goals over the past year," said Kissner.  "As expected, we essentially completed our fiscal 2011 restructuring program to reduce operating costs, continued to roll out innovative new products, and saw the resumption of strong demand for our products and services.  We now have a strong roadmap for the future."
Prior to joining Aviat Networks, Pangia held a number of executive positions at Nortel Networks in Sales, Operations, and Finance.  As President of the Asia Region, he had P&L responsibility for $1.8 billion in sales.
Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2011 Outlook
On May 5, 2011, the Company provided revenue guidance of $105 million to $120 million for the fourth quarter FY2011, based on backlog, business trends and operational changes, and some supply risks specific to Japan.  Although we have not yet finalized and completed all reviews of the financial results for the fourth quarter, we now believe revenue for the fourth quarter FY2011 will be in the range of $115 million to $120 million.  In addition, we expect to report that the orders book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1 and that the company's cash balance increased from end of the previous quarter.  As the company is still assessing revenue as part of its year end 
close, this guidance is subject to change until fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2011 results are announced in August. Also, given the need to complete the year end audit, this is the only guidance we intend to provide at this time.

The information contained in this document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. All statements, trend analyses and other information contained herein about the markets for the services and products of Aviat Networks, Inc. and trends in revenue, as well as other statements identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including "anticipates", "believe", "plan", "estimate", "expect", "goal", "will", "see", "continues", "delivering", "view", and "intend", or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should therefore be considered in light of various important factors, including those set forth in this document. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward-looking statements include the following:
continued price erosion as a result of increased competition in the microwave transmission industry; the impact of the volume, timing and customer, product and geographic mix of our product orders; our suppliers' inability to perform and deliver on time as a result of their financial condition, component shortages or other supply chain constraints, such as the recent natural disasters in Japan;our ability to meet projected new product development dates or anticipated cost reductions of new products; customer acceptance of new products;the ability of our subcontractors to timely perform; continued weakness in the global economy affecting customer spending; retention of our key personnel; our ability to manage and 
maintain key customer relationships; uncertain economic conditions in the telecommunications sector combined with operator and supplier consolidation; the timing of our receipt of payment for products or services from our customers; our failure to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against intellectual property infringement claims by others; the effects of currency and interest rate risks; and the impact of political turmoil in countries where we have significant business.  For more information regarding the risks and uncertainties for our business, see "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 9, 2010 as well as other reports filed by Aviat Networks, Inc. with the SEC from time to time. Aviat Networks undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement for any reason, except as required by law, even as new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.

Good day, everyone and welcome to the Aviat Networks Q3 2015 Financial Results Conference. Today’s call is being recorded.
At this time for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Leslie Phillips, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Leslie Phillips
Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon and welcome to Aviat Networks third quarter 2015 results conference call. I’m joined today by Mike Pangia, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Shahbazian, Chief Financial Officer. This call is being broadcast live over the Internet for all interested parties and the webcast would be archived on the Investors Relations page of the company’s website.
During today’s call, management may make forward-looking statements regarding Aviat’s business, including statements relating to projections of earnings and revenues, business drivers, the timing and capabilities of new products, network expansion by mobile and private network operators and variations of economic recovery in different regions.
These and other forward-looking statements involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect the company’s opinions only as of the date of this call and the company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.
For more information, please see the press release and filings made by the company with the SEC. These can be found on the Investor Relations section of Aviat Networks website at www.aviatnetworks.com.
In addition, during today’s call, management will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, is also available on the company’s website.
With that, I will turn the call over to Mike Pangia. Mike?
Mike Pangia
Thanks, Leslie and good afternoon to everyone listening on the phone as well as on the webcast. We've experienced good progress since our last earnings call in late January. In February, we announced key contract wins in Africa. In March, we premiered what we believe to be the world's most powerful microwave radio for mission-critical networks and throughout the quarter, our CTR product experienced a significant ramp in bookings and shipments. And today, I'm pleased to announce that a large North America mobile operator has selected Aviat to modernize its network. It was our technology offering combined with our strong services and network management capabilities that were instrumental in helping us secure this new customer win.
I'll now provide an overview of our financial results followed by this quarter's customer and product activity. Mike Shahbazian will give a more in-depth review of our financial results and will provide our guidance for the upcoming quarter. I'll then close the call by discussing the actions we are taking to further optimize and improve our business model.
Our fiscal third quarter financial results were largely as expected and we made progress with bookings and our expense reduction initiatives. Fiscal third quarter revenue was $74.8 million. We estimate that our revenue was reduced by approximately $1.4 million due to the strengthening of the US dollar against many of our international currencies. Q3 bookings improved significantly on a sequential basis and we have returned to reporting a book to bill above 1. We are seeing momentum in bookings across nearly every geographic segment, largely fuelled by our CTR product line.

Non-GAAP gross margin was 23.7% and was impacted by a couple of one-time events that Mike will describe in greater detail in his comments. Demonstrating the progress we've already made with our expense reduction actions, third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were down approximately $7 million or 23% year-over-year and nearly $3.5 million or 12.5% sequentially to $23.8 million. We expect to exit fiscal 2015 with a non-GAAP OpEx run rate of approximately $23 million with further improvements expected by midyear fiscal 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was a loss of $4.2 million versus a loss of $7.8 million in the year earlier period. For the first nine months of fiscal 2015, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $5.9 million versus a loss of $20.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2014. Our non-GAAP loss per share for the third quarter was $0.10, an improvement over the $0.16 loss per share reported in the year ago quarter.
Now, for an update on customer and productivity in our major geographic areas. Starting with North America, our mobile and non-mobile business continues on course. On the mobile side, during the quarter, we secured a $9 million contract with a leading North America regional operator and began shipping the all-indoor IRU 600 for the carrier's western region backhaul network. 
The contract includes a strong services component in which we will provide turnkey integration and deployment support. And as I mentioned earlier, we recently secured first time business with a large North America mobile operator. Our technology offering and the strong services offering were key differentiators which allowed Aviat to win this new customer.
In Q3, we experienced a steady flow of business from our non-mobile operations and we expect to see more opportunities in public safety and private low latency networks in Q4 and beyond. That said, it's important to remember that due to the longer bookings to revenue conversion cycle and binary nature of this business, the specific timing of the revenue from our non-mobile business is difficult to predict.
Revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2015 illustrates the inconsistent timing and lumpiness of our non-mobile revenue. While fiscal third quarter revenue for North America was down year-over-year and sequentially, our North America revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 was up 9.3% year-over-year to $114.7 million driven by the strength in our private networks business.
Maintaining our leadership as a provider for mission-critical networks, we recently premiered the IRU 600 EHP. Two to three times more powerful than the typical radio in the market today, we believe the IRU 600 is the most powerful commercial microwave radio ever produced. For use with the 6 gigahertz and 11 gigahertz bands, the product is designed to support mission-critical applications of all types.
Moving to an update on our operations in Africa, across the continent, major players are making investments in enhancing their networks and offering services for businesses and enterprises. Our CTR product with its dual microwave networking and routing capabilities is designed specifically to capitalize on this trend. We are increasingly confident in our position as an important supplier in the region and in Q3, we secured multiple new contracts in Africa. Recently, we began to deliver equipment and perform services under a new three-year turnkey agreement with MTN South Africa. We’ll be working with this tier 1 mobile operator to modernize its mobile backhaul network and expand its network services.
As another example, this quarter we announced several deals with another major African mobile operator, in which Aviat is supplying the CTR, Eclipse and STR microwave radios to complete the operator’s transition to full IP. As part of these projects, our work will extend through Gabon, Nigeria and Tanzania. We are encouraged by our progress in diversifying our business in Africa and believe that our specialized services capabilities will continue to differentiate us from our competition.

In summary, our progress in the quarter is a great illustration of the success we’ve had of reducing our cost structure and realigning our product and services offerings to meet the needs of existing and new customers. We signed new contracts and added new customers. The CTR platform is clearly helping us win new business and retain our position with key customers and we expect this trend to continue. 
Q3 orders for CTR doubled from the prior quarter and through the first five weeks of this quarter, we have already matched the orders total from Q3. Over the next several quarters, we remain focused on expanding share with our key customers, attracting targeted new customers, leveraging our new product ramp, improving operational efficiencies and generating cash. We are seeing improvement in our operations and we are pleased overall with the progress we’ve made this quarter.
Now, I’ll turn the call over to Mike Shahbazian to discuss our financial results in more detail. Mike?
Michael Shahbazian
Thank you, Mike and thanks to all of you for joining us. If you've not already done so, I’d encourage you to download the financial press release from the investors section of our website that we posted earlier today. The release contains Aviat's unaudited GAAP financial statements along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. My prepared remarks will be focused on the non-GAAP financial overview of our fiscal third quarter and the related business trends. Unless otherwise stated and other than revenue, all dollar figures I provide will be on a non-GAAP basis. I’ll then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter.
Revenue for the third quarter came in at $74.8 million compared to $92.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and to $81.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Product revenue was 63% of sales and services were 37% of sales, the same ratios as in the second quarter. Gross margin for the third quarter was 23.7% of sales, down from 27.2% of sales of our fiscal second quarter. The third quarter gross margin was impacted by less favourable absorption of fixed costs due to lower volumes and changes in currency that occurred in the quarter.
As many other U.S.-based companies have reported, we’re affected by the continuing strengthening of the dollar. Margin was reduced by currency impact and additional realized foreign currencies losses, which added $1 million to our cost of sales, resulting in 130 basis point drop in our gross margin.
For the fiscal third quarter, our operating expenses totaled $23.8 million, down from $27.2 million in the fiscal second quarter. This sequential decline was driven by a benefit from the change in currency rates and implementation of our expense reduction measures. Third quarter operating expenses were down approximately $7 million or 23% year-over-year. Our loss from continuing operations for the fiscal third quarter was $6.5 million or a loss of $0.10 per share compared to a loss from continuing operations of $10.2 million or a loss of $0.16 per share in the year ago quarter.
Fiscal third quarter adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $4.2 million compared to a loss of $7.8 million in the year ago quarter. The company ended the fiscal third quarter with a cash balance of $35 million, down from $38.7 million at the close of the fiscal second quarter. Our cash balance was affected by movement in exchange rates relative to the dollar in the quarter, particularly in countries where we are unable to hedge our balance sheet, reducing our US dollar reported cash by $2.7 million. In addition as a result of repatriating cash in the quarter, we incurred expenses of approximately $1 million.
Cash used by operating activities was $400,000 in the fiscal third quarter. CapEx in the quarter amounted to $600,000. Free cash flow, which includes the cash used in operating activities plus CapEx, was a use of $1 million for the quarter.

Now moving to working capital, DSOs were 84 days, up from 80 days last fiscal quarter. DSOs declined due to decreased revenue in the quarter. Our actual receivables and payables balances declined substantially, reflecting the volume of business in the quarter. Days payables outstanding were 60 days compared to 62 last quarter and terms decreased to 5 from 6.1. Inventories increased due to start-up activities related to the network build out in South Africa. 
I’d now like to turn your attention to guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2015. We expect revenue for our fourth quarter in the range of $80 million to $85 million. We estimate that our adjusted EBITDA will be approximately breakeven. We consider adjusted EBITDA to be a good proxy for company cash flows over a normalized period.
We expect breakeven to a slight use of cash for the quarter. Regarding liquidity, we believe our existing cash balance, line of credit and expected future cash collections will provide us with adequate liquidity.
I would now like to turn the call over to Mike for some additional remarks before we turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Mike Pangia
Thanks, Mike. We see momentum from our bookings this quarter, carrying over to higher revenue performance in Q4 and we will make further strides with our business model in other areas. The introduction of our new products, particularly the CTR platform, is proving to be instrumental, requiring new customers as well as increasing our footprint with existing customers. 
Our focus on simplifying the business has resulted in a significant reduction in our expenses, which puts us on a clear path to cash generation. As I look forward to fiscal year 2016, I'm increasingly confident that the actions we have taken are starting to pay off. I would like to thank all of Aviat’s employees for their hard work and efforts.
Now, back to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Evan Dede with H.C. Wainwright.
Kevin Dede
Good afternoon, gentlemen. It’s Kevin Dede. A bunch of things for you, Mike and no offence, Mr. Shahbazian, but I guess I was kind of wondering how you felt about life at Aviat and what your plans were?
Michael Shahbazian
My plans, well, I've been a CFO, this is my ninth company and I started doing interim roles after about 40 years. So I enjoy doing this, but I immensely enjoyed my time period with Aviat. It's a very interesting organization with a very interesting executive and management team and I would say that it's an experience I’ll treasure going forward. So all of these have been experiences and this one is very unique along those lines.
Kevin Dede
So how would you say the search for a permanent CFO is going?
Mike Pangia
Is that question to Mr. Shahbazian or...
Michael Shahbazian
It should be to Mike Pangia.
Kevin Dede
Yeah. That’s sort of an open one.
Mike Pangia
Yeah. It's going very, very well and we are getting very close. So notwithstanding that, again, I appreciate Mike being on board.
Kevin Dede
Great. Okay. So Mr. Pangia, how would you characterize the integration of CTR and MTN and how are the network engineers there thinking about the evolution of their network going forward? And do you see it sort of I guess, their engineers are leveraging your platform to incorporate small-cell if necessary in densely populated areas, just give me some sort of 20,000 foot perspective on how you’re viewing the integration process?
Mike Pangia
Well, first off, we feel very good about our position with MTN. We continue to be very focused on delivering value to them. As expressed in the recent press release, I think winning new business with them is an indication that we are continuing to deliver value. 

CTR is instrumental in that value proposition, both in terms of its capabilities from a layer 2 perspective as well as its networking capabilities. And we actually appreciate the business with MTN and we strive to exceed their expectations on a daily basis and we will continue focusing on delivering them value.
Notwithstanding that, we also feel very good about the progress we've made with other customers in Africa, which also see value in what we’re providing, not only with respect to CTR but also our strong services and support capabilities in the region also are critical to delivering TCO or at least the best TCO relative to other providers and we will continue to strive for that.
Kevin Dede
Okay. I guess sort of as a recall to layer 2, could you sort of take it up into another level of detail, what are they experiencing that you might be able to put the decision as a selling point for other operators?
Mike Pangia
Yes. So we have a number of elements in the value proposition. In terms of the products capabilities from a layer 2 transmission perspective, its ability to do routing and other layer 3 capabilities which also helps as we look at the enterprise space and then on top of that, we have a very strong service capability and support capability, which in the broader scheme of things isn’t just about the pulling equipment and supporting it, but it’s also regarding the logistical elements of working in a region like Africa.
Kevin Dede
So I guess Mike, what I was hoping you might be able to help me clarify is just through the evolution of mobile networks in general, I guess I'm kind of wondering I mean there has been, obviously there is a lot of talk about software defined network and it just seems to me that the CTR fits into that type of evolutionary thinking? I'm just kind of wondering how the engineers at MTN view that and how they see the CTR as an integral product in that evolutionary group?
Mike Pangia
First off, I'm looking at the product’s capabilities and the other attributes that we provide beyond just MTN. So
Kevin Dede
No, I understand. But I mean just wanted to see if the standout is sort of the leading customer on the curve of adoption?
Mike Pangia
No, we've had must multiple customers adopting the product now. As I referred to earlier, we’ve seen a doubling of orders from the second quarter and the third and through the first five week, it’s already equalled the whole last quarter. This is much more than just MTN. So as we talk about the broad range of customers are looking at this product and as it relates to your comments earlier about SDN or software defined networks, this is a step in that direction from the standpoint that it does take products that are multiple products and it integrates that functionality into a product. 
It does provide more software in terms of the value and also another important element as we’re moving it into the software defined networking world is service capabilities have to be strong, because the OpEx part of the equation is also becoming even more critical to a customer and we are also addressing that with our service capabilities, network management tools and support.
Kevin Dede
Okay. Your new North American customer, the one that you announced here this evening, is it fair to say that that customer is a tier 1?
Mike Pangia
It's a large North American mobile operator.
Kevin Dede
Okay. The expense run rate you characterized and it’s at the $23 million range for the next quarter, but in your restructuring release, what was it, maybe a month or two ago, you commented that you hope to extract another $10 million to $12 million out of operating expenses and this evening, you seem to reiterate that and seeing expenses reduce further for the first half of the next fiscal year, I'm just wondering how you might rather characterize that expense reduction and how we might see it in the P&L?

Michael Shahbazian
Okay. So first off, when I talked about a $23 million exit rate, to some extent, you can't look an individual quarter, especially our fourth quarter in anticipation of strong bookings, which we expect to continue. There is a variable element on our sales expense that usually increases in the fourth quarter related to, it’s one of the stronger quarters we normally have with respect to our bookings. And then notwithstanding that, we expect to see further improvements in that OpEx moving into fiscal year 2016 and that's when you will see further improvements, all other things being equal.
Kevin Dede
Okay. But at this point you are not comfortable sort of giving us a ballpark on where you expect to see that?
Michael Shahbazian
We expect it to be improved, it will be improved versus the $23 million. Again all things being equal, there is obviously variable expenses associated with our business as well and to the extent that our business is better than what one would expect from a run rate perspective, that number could be higher, but we’re very focused actually on reducing the fixed cost element of that even further than where we are at right now.
Kevin Dede
Right. So on that fixed cost discussion, is there any of that that you think relates to cost of goods?
Michael Shahbazian
Well, our reductions, I've only referred to the element associated with the OpEx side. But not referencing, first of all, I’m not referencing cost of goods here, I’m referencing the spending associated with delivering and supporting products and above and beyond the OpEx reductions, we’re also having reductions in terms of the overhead part of our business with respect to our supply chain, further signifying that, that benefit which show up as an improvement in our margins.
Kevin Dede
Right. Okay. Can you shed any light on where you might expect gross margin to fall out in the June quarter?
Michael Shahbazian
All I can say is that we’re very focused on improvements across the whole P&L. Our focus is on generating positive EBITDA and gross margins is one lever as part of that value proposition. So I would see -- I am expecting an improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter, but I'm also expecting improvements in other areas and our focus going forward is [ph] on generating positive EBITDA on a consistent quarterly basis.
Kevin Dede
Okay. Could you talk to sort of the overall pricing environment in North America, Africa and then I suppose, I guess, Asia and Europe as much as you can see?
Michael Shahbazian
It's always difficult to provide pricing elements without -- again without reconciling it to total cost of ownership, because there is elements when we talk, when we think about pricing, we’re usually thinking just about the CapEx part of the equation. And that's different than providing value. So what I’m seeing in the industry is that there is obviously continued compression from a hardware perspective, it's more intensive in the international arena than it is in North America, but the perspective there is that’s continuing to be pressured and again that's why software defined network is an important element, but the other values we’re providing in terms of software capability, ability to improve the support, the service side, those are all attributes that lead to improving value to the customer, which ends up generating a benefit on our end in terms of margin and other elements.
Kevin Dede
Can you talk a little bit about that pricing equation vis-a-vis CTR and the competitive offering that you see from Independence?
Michael Shahbazian
So, the other element of pricing is there are certain markets where there is a focus primarily on just the CapEx side of the equation that are extremely price sensitive. And it's very difficult to drive value in those markets that are only looking at one element of the equation. Part of our restructuring efforts have been to focus our activities and where we see the opportunity for that value creation to be there, and that's where CTR fits in as well as all the other elements I discussed earlier with regards to our service and support capabilities. And that’s where our focus is in those markets with those customers.

And it's not just about the mobile operator side as well. We have a significant amount of business in the public safety, private networks domain, in some cases, the sensitivity on price is not as high, it's about delivering value, the mission-critical capabilities of the product are important. So that's what I mean, the pricing equation is difficult to answer without getting reference to markets and verticals and where we are focused and where we are not focused.
Kevin Dede
Okay. Fair enough. Could you give us the breakdown between product and service revenues for March versus December?
Mike Pangia
Sure, Mike.
Michael Shahbazian
March versus December.
Mike Pangia
The last I guess Q2
Kevin Dede
Sequentially, yeah.
Michael Shahbazian
Okay. I'm sorry, so you wanted the
Kevin Dede
Yeah, Mike. I was just looking for product and service reps, percent [ph] of sales for December and March?
Michael Shahbazian
Yeah. So as a breakout between services and product revenues for the quarter as a percentage of revenues, right. Is that what you’re looking for?
Kevin Dede
Yeah. Right. It doesn't have to be percent, I mean if you have the real dollars, whatever you want to offer.
Michael Shahbazian
Right. Kevin, I think that was covered in the script and it was 63% for services revenue -- product revenue and 37% for services revenue.
Mike Pangia
We said it was pretty much even.
Michael Shahbazian
Pretty much even with the same numbers we had for the second quarter.
Kevin Dede
Okay, fair enough. Thank you. One last question for me Mike. There is a lot of chatter about Nokia and Alcatel and I guess there are people on both sides of it, right, whether or not the French government will go for it. I'm wondering what sort of disruption you think it may be causing now and how it might change the competitive landscape for you particularly going forward.
Mike Pangia
Yes. So our focuses are on things that we can control and clearly any time there is something like that that takes place, it could provide an opportunity, based on the fact that there will be integration and there is probably lots of unknown factors. So we’ll look at that as an opportunity at least in the near term and we’ll continue to focus in on building our business moving forward.
Kevin Dede
The win with the new North American carrier, who do you think you displaced there and why?
Mike Pangia
I'm not going to answer that question. No comments on that question.
Kevin Dede
Okay. Alright. Well, I’ll turn it over. Thank you for working with me, Mike. I appreciate it.
Mike Pangia
[indiscernible] So I can't comment on who was displaced, but again I will reinforce that our winning there was a combination of our strong product offering and our service capabilities, including elements like network management. Those were the differentiators.
Kevin Dede
Network management, okay. But not from say you're not, just helping them manage their own.
Mike Pangia
Network management platform in combination with the products.
Kevin Dede
Right, okay. Thank you.
Mike Pangia
You’re welcome.
Operator
We’ll move next to Aaron Yu with Singular Research. 
Aaron Yu
Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Mike Pangia
Good afternoon.
Aaron Yu
So it sounds like the momentum acceleration in the bookings was pretty broad-based across a lot of geographies, wanted to see if you guys can give a little bit more color to whether there is some pent-up demand that's coming back in the market or was it more a function of adoption of CTR and product specific initiatives?
Mike Pangia
Yeah. So I'm very pleased with the actions that we've taken with respect to what we are focusing, the ramp of our new products, continue to leverage our service capabilities, and a combination of all those actions is starting to bear fruit, with respect to new customer wins, which is showing up in terms of improvement in bookings. And I'm feeling increasingly more confident that we continue to see some great momentum, again largely fuelled by CTR which I did indicate already this quarter in the first five weeks in terms of the ramp there. So we’re feeling very good about the actions we've taken and the direction we are heading.

Aaron Yu
And the repatriation of cash, was that just increase for your exposure to FX in any geographies for you guys and hedge or are there sort of other drivers in rationale behind that?
Michael Shahbazian
Right, so we had built up -- this is Mike, we had built up some excess cash in a couple of our international units where it is very difficult to do currency transactions, so we made a decision to accelerate payments and enter in to a couple of swap transactions that allowed us to bring cash back to the US, that certainly helped us from a liquidity standpoint in the US, so that was essential for doing that but because the markets aren’t particularly well-developed, there is just no active foreign exchange market, you we have to do a swap with using bankers and intermediary and there was a cost of doing that and that was the impact that we had to deal with. At the same time, it did allow us to repatriate a significant amount of cash that we can use in the US.
Aaron Yu
So that cost was that the million dollars you mentioned?
Michael Shahbazian
That was a million dollars between foreign exchange and also withholding costs, so the foreign exchange was swap cost and we had some withholding taxes because of the country’s tax regulations.
Aaron Yu
Okay, Thank you guys.
Mike Pangia
Thank you.
