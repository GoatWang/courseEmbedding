Why Satisfi Works
"An unhappy customer will become a loyal consumer if you fix his complaint and do it quickly. Eighty percent (80%) of these folks will come back to you if you’ve treated them fairly. That percentage rises to the upper 90s if you respond immediately." - David Ray, Author
Satisfi enables your business to​ address customer issues in real time. Customers can submit requests using their smartphones through a feedback form tailored to a specific location. Requests are routed to the appropriate on-site staff enabling them to provide assistance in the moment – before the customer leaves unhappy.Beyond good customer relationship management, Satisfi drives revenue. Consider a recent example from a major sports arena. In a game headed to extra innings, one fan could not find any concession stands still serving beer. Through Satisfi, guest services was able to direct the fan to a bar still serving where he happily spent $60.In many stores, customers requests are handled on a first-come, first-served basis – or worse, a race to “find an associate”. Satisfi enables customers to ask for help before an experience turns sour. Stores can further customize service by sending representatives with depth of knowledge or appropriate skill sets based on the nature of the request.Retailers have long recognized that customers who dwell in-store stumble into additional purchases. Because Satisfi fosters engagement, the likelihood of conversion increases as associates are able to offer additional products and services.​The Satisfi analytics platform reveals patterns of performance across different locations and exposes problems of which a business may not even be aware. One university used Satisfi to augment its registration process. Before implementing Satisfi, the university did not recognize that its process had issues. Within the first 5 days, students reported 40 issues that later led to several improvements.​Satisfi ultimately drives sales by improving service, increasing customer retention and avoiding the social media “shame game”. How can Satisfi work for you?
