Gross profit increased 9.6% year-over-year, due to our focus on our efficient management of the business and higher margin customers. We also saw growth in revenue and gross profit margins over the fiscal first quarter ended February 28, 2017, which was significantly impacted by costs associated with our previously settled proxy contest and tender offer.  "Leveraging a robust customer base, including Fortune 500 technology companies, we remain focused on maximizing profitability globally and across industries. We have established a world-class supply chain with strong relationships and productivity capabilities that are enabling us to win new customers. We also have an international footprint that continues to grow with strong sales in Asia and Europe. Importantly, our innovative pipeline of new products continues to drive strong customer acquisition. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders."  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended May 31, 2017  Net sales for the three months ended May 31, 2017 increased by 5.0% to $7.4 million, as compared to net sales of $7.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2016. The increase in net sales is primarily attributable to increases in product orders from customers.  Gross profit for the three months ended May 31, 2017 increased by 9.6% to $1.8 million, as compared to $1.6 million for the three months ended May 31, 2016. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 24.1% for the three months ended May 31, 2017, as compared to 23.1% for the three months ended May 31, 2016. The increases in both metrics are primarily attributable to business with new and existing customers with higher profit margins.

(“Surge” or the “Company”) (OTC Pink:SPRS), a leading supplier of capacitors, discrete semi-conductors and audible/sounding devices, announced today that its Board of Directors has postponed the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to January 5, 2017.The Board issued the following statement in conjunction with this announcement:“We have decided to postpone the Annual Meeting in order to ensure all Surge shareholders are given sufficient time to make an informed decision about their votes. Recently, dissident shareholders Michael Tofias and Bradley Rexroad brought a lawsuit against Surge in Nevada, urging the Company to delay the date of the Annual Meeting and turn over shareholder information.We were surprised by the demand to delay the Annual Meeting, given that the meeting date was validly set by the Company and the dissidents never made this demand previously. Also, under the clear and unambiguous language of the relevant statute, the dissidents are not entitled to the requested shareholder information. However, our commitment to shareholder democracy and transparency remains steadfast, and this lawsuit is a time consuming distraction from the important issues at hand and is wasting the Company’s and shareholders’ resources. Therefore, we have shared the shareholder information with Messrs. Tofias and Rexroad even though we have no obligation under the statute to do so and decided to consent to their demand to delay the Annual Meeting date.We continue to firmly believe that electing Messrs. Tofias and Rexroad to the Board of Surge and immediately pursuing a sale process is not in the best interests of the Company and all shareholders. We remind shareholders that Tofias and Rexroad have not put forth a plan for growing Surge and delivering increased shareholder value, beyond simply displacing your experienced co-founders – Ira Levy and Steve Lubman – from the board and urging a prompt sale of the Company. These “plans” would leave the Company and its shareholders without a clear direction, would only serve to satisfy the short-term interests of these dissident shareholders, and would rob you of long-term value creation.We therefore urge all shareholders to support our nominations of Ira Levy and Steve Lubman, who each has 40 years of experience in the electronics components industry, who together have built the Company into what it is today, and who are deploying a successful strategy to deliver enhanced, long-term value to all shareholders.

Surge Components, Inc. Sends Letter to Shareholders




Your Experienced Co-Founders – Ira Levy and Steve Lubman – Are 
      Executing on a Successful Strategy to Drive Continued Growth at Surge


Dissident Shareholders Tofias and Rexroad Have No Plan Other Than 
      to Sell the Company Quickly, Depriving You of Long-Term Value


Vote Today on the GOLD Proxy Card to Protect Your Investment






November 08, 2016 08:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



DEER PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Directors of Surge Components, Inc. (“Surge” or the 
      “Company”) (OTC Pink:SPRS), a leading supplier of capacitors, discrete 
      semi-conductors and audible and sounding devices, today sent the 
      following letter to Surge shareholders:
    


      ***
    

      November 8, 2016
    

      Dear Fellow Shareholders,
    

      At the upcoming Surge Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on 
      November 22, 2016, we believe you will face a clear choice between:
    

1. Supporting your Company’s co-founders, Ira Levy and Steve 
      Lubman, as they continue to execute on a successful strategy to drive 
      continued growth at Surge and deliver sustainable, long-term value for 
      you. This successful strategy has delivered strong growth and 
      profitability over the past eight years since 2008, and we expect more 
      growth. This past third quarter alone we delivered a 6.6% 
      year-over-year increase in gross profits and a 25.9% gross profit margin.
    

OR


2. Backing dissident shareholders Michael Tofias and Bradley 
      Rexroad, whose only stated plan is to quickly sell the Company so that 
      they can exit their positions, while leaving your money on the table. In 
      their own words from their October 25, 2016 letter, “We continue to 
      believe Surge should be sold, preferably to a strategic buyer.” 
      Now, in the 11th hour, they claim to want to “fix” Surge. But 
      they still offer no plan whatsoever. Rexroad and Tofias do not want to 
      manage or “fix” Surge; they want to sell it. The reality remains that 
      their election would serve their own short-term interests while leaving 
      you – our shareholders – with a rudderless Company.
    

Your Founders:



        Clear growth strategy: higher margin business, expanding international 
        footprint, capitalizing on industry relationships
      

        Each has more than 40 years of industry experience and strong 
        reputations
      

        Building long-term value – delivered strong growth and profitability 
        over the past eight years since 2008
      


The Dissidents:



        No plan, no industry experience, no public board experience
      

        Flip-flopping – quick sale of the Company to "fix Surge"
      

        Grasping at straws – citing 20 year old ancient history to make their 
        case
      


      We urge you to support the re-election of Ira Levy and Steve Lubman as 
      directors at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on November 
      22, 2016, and we recommend that you disregard incorrect and misleading 
      claims made by dissident shareholders Tofias and Rexroad.
    

      Let’s look at the facts when 
      comparing your Company’s founders and the dissidents:
    

Your Founders: Each possesses more than 40 years of 
      deep experience in the electronic components industry. Together 
      they have built Surge since its inception in 1981, and as Surge’s 
      largest stockholders their interests are aligned with yours.



        Co-founders Ira Levy and Steve Lubman have worked hard to build Surge 
        over the past 35 years into the successful and growing world-class 
        business that it is today.
      

        Ira and Steve are highly-respected in the electronic components 
        industry and have the deep customer and supplier relationships that 
        are the lifeblood of the Company’s current and future success.
      

        Under their leadership, Surge’s share price has appreciated 
        tremendously – by 1,313% – over the past eight years.1 
        As owners of approximately 21% of Surge’s stock, Ira and Steve have 
        true “skin in the game” and have the same incentive for the long-term 
        performance of Surge as you.
      


The Dissidents: Tofias and Rexroad have no 
      relevant industry experience and no plan 
      for Surge.



        The dissidents are NOT EXPERTS in the electronic components industry 
        and DO NOT UNDERSTAND the complexity of the business.
      

        They have NOT presented a strategic plan beyond selling the Company, 
        which they have stated multiple times as their goal. The idea in their 
        most recent letter that they have “no preconceived notions about the 
        ‘right’ future direction for Surge,” DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THEIR 
        PREVIOUS STATEMENTS.
      

        Tofias and Rexroad have NEVER served on the board of a public company.
      


Your Founders: Have methodically positioned Surge for 
      future growth and maximum value creation. Our plan 
      is working. Now is not the time to sell. Over nearly four decades 
      your founders have:



        Solidified a robust customer base, including Fortune 500 technology 
        companies, while further focusing sales efforts on higher margin 
        customers to maximize profitability.
      

        Established a world-class supply chain with very strong relationships 
        and an international footprint that continues to grow.
      

        Built a strong balance sheet, with cash on hand of $6.9 million and 
        zero debt, positioning the Company to take value-creating actions such 
        as the current $500,000 stock buyback and investing in future growth, 
        including:

        

            Increasingly focusing our sales efforts on higher margin customers
          

            Continued hiring of top industry talent
          

            Potential acquisitions to build the business
          




The Dissidents: Want to cut off Surge’s momentum for 
      their own short-term interests.



        They have made clear they want the Company to be sold as quickly as 
        possible, so that they can exit their positions. Selling the Company 
        would rob other shareholders of the potential to reap the rewards of 
        our growth strategy.
      

        They claim that, “Things are not improving at Surge,” which we believe 
        to be clearly untrue. Evidence for the positive momentum at Surge 
        includes strong Q3 financial results, an increasing focus on 
        high-margin business, and a growing international footprint 
        demonstrated by the valuable relationships built by Ira and Steve.
      

        Despite their lack of any relevant experience, they want to replace 
        your founders and industry experts Ira Levy and Steve Lubman who are 
        successfully driving a plan to deliver long-term value to shareholders.
      

        They criticize Surge for offering to buy their shares, which we 
        believe is an attempt to draw attention away from the main point: we 
        tried numerous times to find an amicable resolution with the 
        dissidents and stop this costly proxy contest, but they insisted on a 
        “prompt” sale of the entire Company.
      


Your Founders: Have made a point of building strong 
      corporate governance practices at Surge.



        Surge’s Directors have been stewards of shareholder value while 
        adhering to strong corporate governance principles.
      

        A nationally-recognized executive compensation firm recently 
        determined that Surge’s executive compensation is fully in-line with 
        similar companies and that stock and options grants are similarly 
        in-line with peer companies.
      

        Recently-appointed director Martin Novick is an industry expert with 
        nearly 40 years of experience.
      


The Dissidents: Are selectively highlighting in their 
      campaign aspects of the Company’s performance and corporate governance 
      in a misleading effort to paint a picture of poor business performance 
      that is simply UNTRUE.



        Their complaint that we did not allow them to communicate with the 
        shareholders is false. In fact, Tofias and Rexroad have already mailed 
        their proxy materials to Surge shareholders.
      

        They criticize the fact that Surge rents office space from an entity 
        owned in part by Ira Levy and Steve Lubman, but the reality is that 
        this is an arm’s length transaction that is set at fair market value, 
        was approved by the independent directors of the Board and has been 
        fully disclosed in the SEC filings of the Company.
      

        Their complaint about our auditor is without merit: it is perfectly 
        legal and is not a conflict of interest for an auditor to perform work 
        for others.
      

        Their criticism of executive compensation is baseless. From 2000-2008, 
        a difficult time in the electronic components industry, Ira Levy and 
        Steve Lubman were not granted any equity compensation. That changed 
        only when they had turned around the Company after 2008, having 
        strengthened sales and profits. Since 2008, Surge’s stock has since 
        increased 1,313%.2 Ira and Steve’s compensation is 
        heavily dependent on meeting business incentives.
      

        They have issued statements that we believe completely mischaracterize 
        the Company’s recently adopted NOL shareholder rights plan. This plan 
        was adopted to protect very valuable net operating loss carryforwards 
        (“NOLs”) – estimated at over $10 million for the long-term benefit of 
        the Company and its shareholders. This plan is up for vote by 
        shareholders at the upcoming Annual Meeting – leaving it up to you 
        whether this protection remains in effect.
      


Our strategic plan is working – our continued results bear this out. 
      Now is not the time for a rushed sale of the Company. Unfortunately, 
      two individuals have chosen to wage a costly and distracting proxy fight 
      to pursue their own personal agendas. Your vote is important and 
      will shape the Company’s ability to continue to deliver long-term 
      shareholder value.

Surge Components, Inc. Announces Postponement of Annual Meeting of 
      Shareholders




- Decision Follows Demand by Dissident Shareholders to Delay Meeting -








November 11, 2016 09:28 AM Eastern Standard Time



DEER PARK, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Surge Components, Inc. (“Surge” or the “Company”) (OTC Pink:SPRS), a 
      leading supplier of capacitors, discrete semi-conductors and 
      audible/sounding devices, announced today that its Board of Directors 
      has postponed the Company’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders to January 5, 
      2017.
    

      The Board issued the following statement in conjunction with this 
      announcement:
    

      “We have decided to postpone the Annual Meeting in order to ensure all 
      Surge shareholders are given sufficient time to make an informed 
      decision about their votes. Recently, dissident shareholders Michael 
      Tofias and Bradley Rexroad brought a lawsuit against Surge in Nevada, 
      urging the Company to delay the date of the Annual Meeting and turn over 
      shareholder information.
    

      We were surprised by the demand to delay the Annual Meeting, given that 
      the meeting date was validly set by the Company and the dissidents never 
      made this demand previously. Also, under the clear and unambiguous 
      language of the relevant statute, the dissidents are not entitled to the 
      requested shareholder information. However, our commitment to 
      shareholder democracy and transparency remains steadfast, and this 
      lawsuit is a time consuming distraction from the important issues at 
      hand and is wasting the Company’s and shareholders’ resources. 
      Therefore, we have shared the shareholder information with Messrs. 
      Tofias and Rexroad even though we have no obligation under the statute 
      to do so and decided to consent to their demand to delay the Annual 
      Meeting date.
    

      We continue to firmly believe that electing Messrs. Tofias and Rexroad 
      to the Board of Surge and immediately pursuing a sale process is not in 
      the best interests of the Company and all shareholders. We remind 
      shareholders that Tofias and Rexroad have not put forth a plan for 
      growing Surge and delivering increased shareholder value, beyond simply 
      displacing your experienced co-founders – Ira Levy and Steve Lubman – 
      from the board and urging a prompt sale of the Company. These “plans” 
      would leave the Company and its shareholders without a clear direction, 
      would only serve to satisfy the short-term interests of these dissident 
      shareholders, and would rob you of long-term value creation.
    

      We therefore urge all shareholders to support our nominations of Ira 
      Levy and Steve Lubman, who each has 40 years of experience in the 
      electronics components industry, who together have built the Company 
      into what it is today, and who are deploying a successful strategy to 
      deliver enhanced, long-term value to all shareholders. Vote today on the GOLD 
      proxy card to pave the way for continued growth and value creation at 
      Surge.”
