				Testimonials			



  


BF Joy has been a customer of All Covered, formerly ARHD, for over 6 years.  We’ve enjoyed having a partnership with BF Joy leadership that has allowed our teams to collectively make smart decisions about Information Technology investments to further strengthen BF Joy’s long standing tenure as a leader in their field.  We’re proud to be part of the BF Joy team and wish them another 100 years of success! 
Josh Lippy ARHD


B Frank Joy was a very valued partner. During our time working together, they brought successful experience, a driven team and a very positive reputation in their market space. I wish the Joy Company all the success in their next 100 years. 
Larry Kiest, Jr. President / LMK Technologies


A true measure of success for any business is the number of years in business. B. Frank Joy, celebrating its 100 years in business, has clearly realized that success. Further, keeping the business in the family and passing the leadership from one generation to the next over 100 years is rarely accomplished. Of course that was achieved with well executed strategies and hard work by many people. The Joy Family, the B. Frank Joy Management and its team of employees should be very proud. 
Timothy Cummins, CPA, CCIFP Partner


Congratulations on the last 100 years and hopes for a stronger next 100.

I have had the pleasure of working with the Owners, Management and a large portion of the field personnel at The Joy Companies since 1985 – (32 years). All the folks at Joy have been very professional and exciting to work with through their various Strategic Plan changes. I look forward to our continuing partnership for many more years. 
Joyce D. Kenny President / SCG
