You feel as if you are catapulted back into the 1930's and 1940's, a behind the scenes visitor trailing FDR's Head Secret Serviceman. Excellent. Could not put it down. So many first hand accounts of FDR, his reactions, what he was really like, the real man. Worth it!!0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Macdonaldon February 21, 2008Format: Library Binding|Verified PurchaseMike Reilly was my grandma's brother, so I found this memoir to be fascinating. As a history reader it has merit as well, offering insights into the world of the White House, the fear and diplomacy of the war era, and some views of the Yalta and Cairo conferences. The culture clash between the Arab delegation on a Navy ship and the author's attitude to them in the 40's is interesting in light of today's "troubles" in that region.Robin MacDonaldHughson, CA11 comment|
