Kemper Arena | Experience | Exponent

































   

 















Kemper Arena







 Background
On June 4, 1979, in the same facility that once had hosted the Republican National Convention, nearly a third of Kemper Arena’s roof collapsed during a rainstorm. A supervisor had observed water pouring in and the scoreboard falling. Finally, a large area of the roof collapsed onto an unoccupied seating area. 
Designed by architect Helmut Jahn, the 17,600-seat Crosby Kemper Memorial Arena was regarded as innovative for its design simplicity with no interior columns to obstruct spectator views. Three exterior space frames supported the roof: three acres of concrete and steel weighing over 1,500 tons. 
The roof was designed to release rainwater gradually through intentionally undersized drains, each servicing individual tributary areas. But the June 4 storm was intense, raining over 4 inches per hour with winds gusting to 70 mph. Overloads at the roof drains were exacerbated by winds that pushed water unevenly and by deflection of the space frame and roof trusses, which caused ponding. 
 Our Work
Exponent inspected the debris and zeroed in on steel truss connections in the flat portion of the roof between the famed Space Frames, which had held the roof up. The collapse was triggered by fracture of the high strength bolts, part of the hanger that suspended the roof from the space frames. Analysis demonstrated that failure of just one of four bolts per hanger resulted in a large prying load on the three remaining bolts. Once they failed, the hanger shed its load, overloading adjacent hangers. Lack of proper estimation of rainwater loads under high wind conditions, and lack of redundancy in the roof support system (ability to transfer loads after partial system failure) were principal shortcomings of the design, which was based on commonly accepted but sometimes erroneous understanding of uniform rainwater loading and even distribution of connection load to individual bolts. The issues were corrected, and the arena re-opened within a year.

Our History







Failure Analysis Associates (FaAA) was founded in Palo Alto, California, in 1967 when three professors from Stanford University and two engineers from Stanford Research Institute (SRI) decided to pioneer a new field - investigating how and why failures and accidents occur. FaAA initially provided engineering expertise to the legal and insurance industry. In the 1970’s, the Company continued to expand its accident investigation services while also responding to the increased engineering requirements of the utility and nuclear power industries. In the 1980’s, the Company added new engineering and science disciplines including civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, biomechanics, data analysis/statistics, human factors and visual communication services. We were well-known and respected for our independent investigations on some of world's biggest engineering accidents and failures and we expanded our office footprint outside of California.

Our History







Failure Analysis Associates (FaAA) was founded in Palo Alto, California, in 1967 when three professors from Stanford University and two engineers from Stanford Research Institute (SRI) decided to pioneer a new field - investigating how and why failures and accidents occur. FaAA initially provided engineering expertise to the legal and insurance industry. In the 1970’s, the Company continued to expand its accident investigation services while also responding to the increased engineering requirements of the utility and nuclear power industries. In the 1980’s, the Company added new engineering and science disciplines including civil engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, biomechanics, data analysis/statistics, human factors and visual communication services. We were well-known and respected for our independent investigations on some of world's biggest engineering accidents and failures and we expanded our office footprint outside of California.

We design and build custom trade show displays :  A Full Service Exhibit House
At any trade show or exhibition, your booth has to perform two functions. It has to attract attendees, and it has to effectively promote your brand.
At Exponents, we understand this challenge, and we embrace it. We don’t just sell one-size-fits-all exhibits. Instead, we work hand and hand with our clients through the process of creating a unique trade show booth that is perfect to represent them and their brand.
Turnkey Trade Show Rental Booths
We design and fabricate custom turnkey rental booths unique to your brand, products and services. We offer turnkey rental booths, allowing our clients to connect with audiences in unique, memorable ways.
If your show marketing budget doesn’t allow you to buy a new trade show booth, Exponents can help. In addition to crafting trade show booths, Exponents offer customized high quality trade show rental exhibits .
This allows you to tap into the potential offered by a custom trade show exhibit without making the same financial commitment.



Why Choose Exponents?
As a world leader, operating globally, we offer  innovative trade show booths, displays and rental exhibits. Every Exponents trade show booth is designed with modularity in mind to make it easy to adapt to your changing needs, locations and trade show schedules.
We understand that each business is different and from the moment you choose us as your trade show booth builder, we’ll listen to your trade show objectives and work with you to create a truly unique trade show booth design that works for your brand.
Once your trade show booth has been designed, we’ll pre-build it in our manufacturing facility which gives you the opportunity to preview the booth before it ships to the show. This service gives complete peace of mind and allow you to make any tweaks or suggest any last minute changes.
Our Service includes 
 Free 3D design service
 A dedicated project manager handling all show service paperwork and coordination.
 Shipping to exhibition center
Full installation and dismantling service

        Best vendor sourcing reviews on manufacturing testing services | VendOp          ×    Thanks For Logging In Refreshing...                × We Would Love To Help        Close  Send Message             All Categories     Testing Services           Performance evaluation vendor reviews on testing services for manufactured products.          Overview Browse Companies  As a purchasing manager or company representative searching out the best source for your project requiring testing services for manufacturers (any size) you are very aware of the challenges of finding the right company. Visiting company websites does not give you actual experiential, objective feedback. It is subjective marketing. What you need is objective, peer-to-peer reviews that are independent and trustworthy. What you need are third party, authoritative reviews from actual customers of the supply chain manufacturer firm. The vendor reviews below are written by testing services customers and include written commentary and scorings across many major and minor criteria that are important to you. This assures you of contacting a company that’s been vetted by other companies through the entire cycle of a job, start to finish. And they performed well. This is information you can really use and trust for your business to business manufacturing supply chain sourcing.
Your critical assessment of other companies are very useful. We urge you to provide reviews of companies in your supply chain.

Sourcing the best company to perform the services you need is hard. We know this from our own procurement experience. You don’t know how well the testing company will perform until you’re far into the work. The question is: how can you source supply chain vendors and have a reliable picture of how’ll they do over the entire cycle? A lot of money and time is on the line. Independent, third-party vendor performance reviews for companies that do mechanical testing services are presented on our site to assist you in sourcing. The reviews below are written by customers of the firms. They’ve been through a complete cycle (or more than one) with the service providers, and then report with star rating scores and open-opinion commentary on their experiences. Other manufacturing measurement tools round out the information available to you for your strategy and next step. The information is comprehensive and based in real experience. That’s a powerful combination for you in business to business manufacturer procurement.
Your opinion is valuable in the B2B world. We encourage you to write reviews of companies you’ve used as a manufacturing vendor in your supply chain.

Exponent has a full-time staff of over 900 located in 25 international offices. Exponent’s multidisciplinary organization of engineers, scientists, physicians and business consultants, addresses complicated issues facing industry and government today. The firm’s consultants provide product design analysis, development, and testing; analyze failures and accidents to determine their cause and prevent their recurrence; and evaluate environmental and human health concerns to find cost-effective solutions. Exponent is certified to ISO 9001 and is authorized by the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide professional engineering services.
The Philadelphia Laboratory is proudly recognized as an ISO 17025 accredited laboratory (A2LA Certificate 2561.01). Additionally, the laboratory is fully compliant with CFR 21 Part 58, U.S. FDA Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).         Exponent Inc Reviews   All Reviews and Filters  | Write A Review             Premium Lab           Andrew Kohm      CEO  @ ACME Enterprises  Executive Management,  Medical Device 11/24/2014       Speed 4 /  Price 3 /  Quality 5     Mechanical Testing      I would not use Exponent for all of your testing. Most testing does not need the premium services that Exponent provides. If you need testing done that will be scrutinized, use Exponent. They will ensure that your tests are done correctly and will hold up under review.  They are also great if you do not know how to perform a test or need help designing the testing regime.    Strengths:  The main strengths of Exponent Biomechanical group is their expertise and reputation. You will be working with some great biomechanics experts. Everything from the quote to the final report are well written and very detailed. They have onsite load frames to perform the testing and you are encouraged to be present during testing. Besides the project leads, they have great support personnel. In many labs, the expertise of the Exponent support staff would be your lead on the project.   

If equipment is needed which this office does not have, they can leverage their internal and external network to find a place that does have it. 

They can design fixtures and arrange for fabrication as well.   Needs to improve:  The in house expertise, professionalism and attention to detail all come at a price, cost. They are not cheap by any means. In fact, they can be up to twice as expensive as other labs. 

Be careful of up selling. While in many cases this can increase the data collected, make sure that it is necessary to your project.
