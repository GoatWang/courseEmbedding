Our Company


						Founded on the belief that customers deserve more from their energy supplier, Energy Plus offers rewards to all of its 
                        customers each month just for paying their energy bills. It's a new way of looking at your energy service.
					

						To help bring customers the quality service they deserve, Energy Plus is backed by its parent company, NRG Energy, Inc., a Fortune 250 
                        company at the forefront of changing how people think about and use energy. 
                        Learn more about what the NRG family has to offer.


						Energy Plus allows customers to choose a plan that fits their needs. Our plans offer different pricing options and rewards, 
                        and the ability to add a Green Option to support the environment by offsetting electricity usage with Renewable Energy Certificates 
                        (RECs) produced by wind power generation facilities. Perhaps the best part is that you don't have to do anything differently. 
                        There will be no interruption in your service. Your local utility will continue to deliver your electricity, read your meter 
                        and send your bill, while you reap the benefits of joining the Energy Plus family.
					

						Energy Plus serves customers in Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

Scam
I was given a competitive rate for the first 30 days - only slighter higher than Peco. Ever since then I have been charged over 4 cents over any other company is charging in PA. my electric bill is over $2000. Please stay away.

Fraud
The Company is a fraud, They wrap customers up with a special hook offers like free miles or save on state tax and free points with an advertising hint that you are going to save money. Once you bite because you think you are going to save on your utility bill they have you and the fraud begins. One they never deposit the points or miles as agreed into your accounts and when you call they will tell you its a billing error or they over looked it. Second they gauge you on the cost of your electric you buy from them. They tell you they are buying at market prices but you will see you bill only go up on the average of 100-300% or even more. By the time you realize what is going on and call to cancel they tell you it takes a billing cycle to switch back and steal more of your money. I was with them for almost a year until I paid attention to what was happening. They are stealing from NY customers and the Attorney General needs to get involved. I plan on going after this company on my own and am in the process of collecting customer bills to put together a class action lawsuit. I have been posting on message boards and there are hundreds of upset customers who feel there money was stolen also. The best part is when you call Energy Plus holdings to complain and let them know you want your money back and accuse them, they will issue a refund immediately to keep you quite. They are praying on people who wont pay attention or are embarrassed to fight them and are making millions at the expense of Energy customers who were duped. I have written certified letters to all the Energy Companies they are working with. I have also notified Jet Blue, U-Promise, and Marriot Rewards among others to let them all know that Energy Plus Holdings is using there name in a well planned fraud to deceit there long time loyal customers. If you have been taken by this company and want to join the fight e-mail us right away. We will get this company for what they are doing.

Scam
HUGE SCAM COMPANY








		    James  Send email




 






		    Feb 23, 2012
		




Scam
After receiving offers to reduce my electric bill if I switched from my local provider NYSEG, I took the bait. My bills became outrageously expensive, so I compared the KWH charge to my previous year's bill from NYSEG and found I was being charged 250% more per KWH! I called NYSEG to confirm their current pricing and, yep, they were still two fifths of what Energy Plus Holdings was charging. When I called to cancel my service with Energy Plus they said it would take two months to switch back to NYSEG, therefore forcing me to be overcharged several hundred dollars more! Don't make the same mistake I did. Do your research before switching. Energy Plus Holdings is bad news.

Scam
We were scammed by Energy Plus. We were charged at least 5 cents more per KWH with Energy Plus compared to the energy supplier’s standard average rate. Energy Plus assured me we were getting the market standard average rate! According to my bills the standard average rate stayed the same for 5 months & it was 5 cents higher than their competitors!!! We are struggling to pay our bills and to be over charged almost $50 a month!!! Shame on Energy Plus!! Now I am watching the electric bill! I learned my lesson!!

 Who is Energy Plus?



            Energy Plus is an energy supply company based in Philadelphia, PA that offers electricity service through Energy Plus Holdings LLC and natural gas
            service through its affiliate Energy Plus Natural Gas LLC. Our goal is to bring innovation to the energy sector by pairing energy service with reward
            incentives. We are backed by our parent company, NRG Energy, Inc., a Fortune 200 company at the forefront of changing how people think about and use
            energy.
        

            For more information, please visit the Our Company section of our website.
        



Deregulation

What is deregulation?



						Deregulation is the process by which governments remove, reduce, or simplify restrictions with the intent of encouraging efficiency and
                        competition in markets. Deregulation in the United States traces its roots to the oil crisis of the 1970s but it took until the late 1990s
                        to put the idea of energy deregulation into practice. Today, about half of the states have enacted some form of energy deregulation.
					

						Before deregulation, utilities controlled all three components of the energy industry: generation, transmission and the sale of energy.
                        Deregulation divides those processes, with different companies having the ability to handle each aspect.
					



What is Energy Plus' role in providing energy in deregulated states?



						Energy Plus is an energy supplier that buys energy on the open market and sells
						it to our customers, bundling it with rewards to offer a new approach to a standard service.
						Utilities still handle the delivery to our customers’ homes, ensuring the
						wires, pipes and meters are properly working. For this reason, energy charges are separated into
						supply and delivery portions – but our customers continue to receive consolidated
						bills that reflect charges from both their utility company and Energy Plus.
					



Who delivers my energy?



						Delivery will continue to be provided by your local utility company, which has the
						responsibility to ensure the wires, pipes and meters are working properly. Switching to Energy Plus
						is seamless – you will not experience any interruption in service.
					



Deregulation has made choosing my energy supplier a lot more confusing. How do I know I can trust Energy Plus?



						Deregulation doesn’t mean lack of oversight. States that have paved the way for innovation
						in the energy market still maintain oversight of suppliers, who are controlled through a
						licensing process.  Energy Plus is licensed in all of the states where we operate. For
						state-specific information and our license numbers, please visit our
						Service Areas page.
					



What is an ESCO?



						ESCO is a term used to refer to an energy supplier such as Energy Plus. It stands for Energy
						Services Company and is a term used often in New York.
					




Rates

What is a variable-rate plan?



						Energy Plus offers variable supply rate plan products. With this type of energy supply service, the supply rate
						you pay may change each month. The supply rate may be different, including higher, than the supply rate charged
						by your local utility company. Because Energy Plus's variable supply rate plans require no long-term commitment,
						you can evaluate your plan each month to determine if it's working for you without being locked into a long-term
						contract. (Cancellation may take 1-2 billing cycles depending on your utility’s timeframe for processing the request.)
					



What is a fixed-rate plan?



                    Energy Plus offers fixed supply rate plan products. With this type of energy supply service, the supply rate will remain
                    fixed for the length of your fixed-price contract. You’ll enjoy the security of knowing your price won’t change for the
                    length of your contract. An early cancellation fee may apply if you cancel your service before your contract is set to
                    expire. Before your contract is set to expire, we will notify you of your contract renewal and pricing options.
                



How much will my supply service cost?



						For variable plans, we will determine the variable supply price in our discretion based on many different factors,
                        which may include competitive prices, industry charges we are responsible for, applicable state and local taxes,
                        profit margins, or other business conditions. The supply rate may be different, including higher, than the supply
                        rate charged by your local utility company. Please review your selected plan Important Offer details for more
                        information about your specific supply rate.
					




Switching to Energy Plus

How do I switch?



                        Switching is simple and can be done over the phone or online. Because we offer
                        service in different states, please visit our Service Areas page and
                        select your state to find the correct phone number to ensure your call is properly routed and answered as quickly
                        as possible.
					



What information will I need to enroll?



						You will only need a copy of your electricity and/or natural gas bill to complete your enrollment. We handle the rest
                        so that you will not experience any interruption in service. Your local utility company will continue to provide all
                        transmission services, including delivering the energy to your home, reading your meter and handling any service emergencies.
					



Do I have to contact my utility company or current supplier before switching to Energy Plus?



						No. We take care of contacting your current provider as part of the enrollment process.
					



How long does it take to enroll over the phone?



						It takes approximately ten minutes to enroll over the phone.
					



Is there a cost to enroll?



						No. Energy Plus does not charge start-up fees of any kind. In some cases, your
                        local utility company may charge a nominal fee to switch.
					



Is there a long-term commitment required?



						If you select our fixed supply rate plan, an early cancellation fee may apply
                        if you cancel your service before your contract expires. If you select our variable
                        supply rate plan, you can cancel without a termination penalty.
					



What happens once I switch to Energy Plus?



						As a new customer, you will receive a welcome letter or email from Energy Plus that
                        includes our terms and conditions. In most states, you’ll start seeing Energy Plus listed
                        on your normal utility bill after one to two billing cycles.
					



How long does it take for my Energy Plus service to start?



						In most states, your new Energy Plus service will take from one to two billing cycles to begin. For more information,
						please visit our Service Areas map and select your state.
					



How do I cancel?



						You may cancel service by calling our customer service team. To appropriately route your
						call, please visit our Contact Us page to find the correct phone number
						for your state. Please note that your utility controls the effective date of cancellation, so it
                        may take 1-2 billing cycles before the cancellation is effective.
					




Billing

How will I be billed?



						Energy Plus customers will continue to receive a consolidated bill from their local utility company.
                        Your bill will contain separate charges for the energy you used (the supply) and for getting that
                        energy to your house (the delivery). The supply portion reflects charges from Energy Plus; the delivery
                        portion reflects charges from your utility company.
                    

						Billing varies according to your state and utility region. For more information about billing where
						you live, visit our Service Areas map and select your state.
					



How can I pay my bill?



						Because Energy Plus supply service is billed through your utility company,
						the methods of payment vary. For more information about billing where you live, visit our
						Service Areas map and select your state.
					



How can I enroll in budget billing?



						Please refer to our Service Areas page to
						see if budget billing is available in your area. This page will direct you to the correct
						phone number to call to enroll in budget billing.

Where does Energy Plus serve customers?

						Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. We also currently
						offer natural gas service in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Ohio. To find out if your

						Service Areas map and select your state. Please note that
						Energy Plus is temporarily not enrolling new customers in Connecticut or New York.
					



Can I be notified if Energy Plus becomes available in my area?



						Yes. Please Contact Us and we will add your information to our notification list.
					




Green Option

How can I "go green" with Energy Plus?



						Energy Plus offers customers a way to support the environment through our Green Option, a program
						that directly ties consumption with the creation of 100% wind power, one of the cleanest forms
						of electricity available. For about a penny more per kilowatt hour, Green Option customers reduce
						the nation’s dependence on conventional electricity generated by fossil fuels – while
						earning their choice of rewards.
					



How does the Green Option work?



						Every kilowatt-hour of electricity our Green Option customers use counts toward the purchase of Renewable
						Energy Certificates (RECs) - the “currency” of renewable electricity production in the United States.
                        One REC represents proof that one megawatt-hour of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy source.
					



What is a REC?



						Once renewable electricity such as wind power is fed into the electric grid, it’s not possible to separate
						it from other sources of electricity. So, a credit (REC) is created as a way to account for – and
						encourage – green energy’s contribution to the grid. RECs are sold separately and only one
						certificate may be issued for each unit of renewable electricity produced. The RECs purchased by Energy Plus support
						100% wind-generated power.
					




Am I signing up to get green electricity sent to my home?



						No. You will continue to receive electricity the same way, but when you sign up for the Green Option,
						we will purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) produced by
						wind power generation facilities located in the United States to match 100% of your electricity usage.
					



Are energy credits a substitute for conservation?



						No.  The best way to reduce energy consumption is to use less energy.  Energy credits are just
						one tool that encourages the creation of smarter, greener power.

After receiving offers to reduce my electric bill if I switched from my local provider NYSEG, I took the bait. My bills became outrageously expensive, so I compared the KWH charge to my previous year's bill from NYSEG and found I was being charged 250% more per KWH! I called NYSEG to confirm their current pricing and, yep, they were still two fifths of what Energy Plus Holdings was charging. When I called to cancel my service with Energy Plus they said it would take two months to switch back to NYSEG, therefore forcing me to be overcharged several hundred dollars more! Don't make the same mistake I did. Do your research before switching. Energy Plus Holdings is bad news.

I agree. Energy Plus Holdings is costing me hundreds of dollars. I am switching back to NYSEG immediately. I'm a little concerned over what they are going to charge me for my last bill.

I am an Energy Plus Supervisor and was very concerned to read about your experience. After looking into our customer database, I was unable to find any account that matches your information, and would like to be able to discuss with you further. I encourage you to call our customer service team at 877-320-0356 to handle this situation. With respect to your specific concerns:
•	We offer a market-rate product whereby we buy electricity every day at the best possible price and use that price to set our rate so we can be as competitively priced as possible. We cannot speak to why the utility companies sometimes have lower rates than ours. Rates also do vary across the state of New York so one customer's experience is not indicative of all regions. Right now, many of our customers in NY and CT are receiving rates lower than their local utility and our competitors. 
•	The length of time it takes to return back to the utility is completely governed by the utility’s rules. We submit all cancelations immediately and the utility informs us as to when the cancellation will take place. In this instance we would encourage you to call NYSEG and ask them for an off-cycle meter reading so that your billing cycle will end and your service can be switched back more quickly.
•	We do not charge cancellation fees nor lock customers into a contract. Customers can try our service, and if they are dissatisfied, they can cancel at any time without penalty. Unlike our competitors, we offer many different programs which provide extra value to customers such as earning cash back or airline miles. We encourage customers to ask us about our offers to ensure they are receiving the benefit that best suits their needs.

We got scam by Energy Plus also, my first bill is double compare to Central Hudson charged us. Be careful with them, do not listen to their promise. I am thinking about reporting to NY attorney general office and see if they can do anything.

I was solicited by Energy Plus today and found the offer suspicious. First I was asked to look at my Central Hudson bill to see if I qualified and then, when I said I didn't have it, i was told that I automatically qualified. I was then offered to save on various minor line items, such as sales tax, but not told that this saving would entail changing subscribers. First the sales person wanted to "hook" me. 

I had previously been offered cheaper electricity by IDT, an offer I accepted and which resulted in huge overcharges such as are described above. IDT is a fortune 1000 company that also offers the PennyTalk calling card, which is another huge scam that cost me up to a couple of hundred dollars when I attempted to buy their calling card to avoid expensive "off system" cell phone charges during a trip to Canada. PennyTalk is advertised in the AAA magazine, which is where I first learned of it. I incorrectly thought AAA would somehow vet their advertisers at a minimal level, but that was wishful thinking.

Having determined that IDT was essentially a criminal enterprise, and that the sale of bargain electricity was attracting companies of this kind, I was naturally suspicious of Energy Plus. I persisted in asking the Energy Plus sales rep questions about what my rate would be but the best they could say was that they'd been consistently low. I had to dig at them to get them to clarify that the rate was floating and that it was not guaranteed to be anything in particular in the future. At this point I told them the best I could do was research their offer and get back to them. Having found the above reports of overcharging my research is finished, and so is my interest in their offer.

Paul, I could not agree more. We just recently got a letter telling us we get a bonus and cashback for switching to Energy Plus if we switch from CL&P. Obviously intrigued, I was trying to get some more information online and stumbled upon these comments.

So thank you all for commenting. I would have gotten extremely angry if we ended up going through with the switch and had our bill jump. Their letter is going right in the trash.

I signed up for Energy Plus in CT and my bill has actually gone down a little. The first month it was up a bit and I was alarmed. I waited to see my second bill and everything was in line as promised.
I am not sure if I am getting the service I am due to the complaints about or my location. I just know I am paying a little less and I am collecting Sky Miles each month.
I am very happy with the service.

I can't even begin to tell you what a rip-off Energy plus has been. My poor father has been paying 14 cents an hour and this month his rate went to 17 cents. His bill is $1, 200 and that's US dollars! Con Ed's current rate is 8 cents and last month's was 6 cents and He has been paying 14 cents for several months...

I told my father to call them and demand his money back for the rip-off. Plus he NEVER got his 3% rebate that they promised and it he has been with them over a year!

Good luck NY residents and we should do something with the NY Attorney General Office!

I AM FURIOUS! The same thing happened to us with Energy Plus - in the last 7 months we have been charged $442 MORE than we would have paid had we been with National Grid as our supplier! It makes me so angry that they get away with the FALSE ADVERTISING. Needless to say, we've since switched back and will never make that mistake again!

I'm a Con Ed coustomer in NY and was told that I would have to wait for at least one billing cycle to complete for Energy Plus to be removed from my account after finally waking up and doing research. YOU NEED TO ASK CON EDISON TO CANEL YOUR CURRENT ACCOUNT AND RE-CREATE A NEW ACCOUNT FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO DROP ENERGY PLUS IMMEDIATELY. They will not offer that option to you, you need to request it.

I received an offer to get JetBLue points for switching, their literature did not provide too much detailm, so I was immediately suspicious. Thanks to these postings, I am going to toss in the garbage their offer. I do have a question on how do I know if I'm getting the best price from my current provider? Any insight into tis would be greatly appreciated!

I just received a bill from Energy Plus that was $0.15 per Kwh. Called Central Hudson to see what they are charging, and it is 0.0855. Do not be tempted to switch based on the promise of miles or hotel points. This will end up costing you big $!! They have no explanation for their outrageous rates, other than they buy electricity daily and costs have been rising.

I just noticed the difference today between Energy Plus and Con Edison as the electricity supplier. I am very stupid to believe them I can save money by switching from con ed. to energy plus. I took out all my bills (over 9 months), and compared the difference from my friend which lives next to me. The latest billing summary as of Jan 20, 2010; I used 265 kWh, the total delivery charges is $46.59 + $49.50 (electricity supply charges by Energy Plus) = $96.09 

However you know what I found out from my friend's bill? He got total charges $77.25; he used 283 kWh, total delivery charges is $47.43 + $26.49 (electricity supply charges by Con Edison) = $77.25; which he paid about $20 less than me even used more electricity than me. What a shame for Energy Plus!!!

Thus I briefly calculate the overpaid for 9 months, and i have the total $359.78

In conclusion, Energy Plus is a scam, go call your original supplier, and switch back to it, you can save several hundred bucks in a year.

Thank you for all these posts. I'm in CT and we just received this offer in the mail. They have been harrassing us about changing, which made me suspicious. Even after telling them that we would call them if we wnated it, they called at least 3 times a day. Total harrassment! I will stay with my current provider for now.

I tried speaking with a ConEd rep about my bill. She was totally rude and I was on hold for about 20 minutes. They basically instructed me to call Energy Plus and ask for my money back. When you go to a gas station, fill up your tank and then find another station with gas 10 cents cheaper, do you get a refund?
When calling Energy Plus to discuss, I spoke with a very polite rep who answered my questions. Rates are variable, and there were many months my rate was lower than ConEd. I doubt ConEd would give me any credit for those months. 
Bottom line, there are no guarantees every company will save you every month. At least you have a choice. ConEd will gauge your eyeballs out with delivery charges, regardless of who your supply comes from. And they could care less.

I'm glad I found this site! I also got a letter from Delta with the EnergyPlus offer. After checking around, it seems that EP is selling electricity for over 15 cents a kwh and when I checked on my provider's website, the cheapest was $0.09 or almost 40% less. 

Switching would have given me 10, 000 bonus miles, but almost $40 more a month in electricity bills. Not worth it!

Do not go with Energy Plus! I'm a New York City resident. Just cancelled my billing with Energy Plus. I went with Energy Plus on the asumption I would save money. NO CHANCE !! Their rates this month were 18.8 cents, Con ed was 7 cents. I've been with Energy Plus for 6 months now. Every bill higher and higher ! We're not even into the summer months. Do not go with Energy Plus!

CL&P had been charging 11.5 per kwh and just dropped it's rate to 9.48 effective Jan. 2011.

Energy Plus has been charging me 14 cents the last two months. It is partially my fault as I have not been diligent in scrutinizing my bill lately but as of today I have fired them.

If you know anyone who is doing business with this company do them a favor and let them know they too are getting ripped off!!

I am going to post on every website I can find to bring this company and their deceptive price structure into the public's eye.

They pissed off the wrong person when they screwed with me!

Energy Plus Holdings - Don't walkEnergy Plus HoldingsUnited StatesI also got baited in by Energy Plus - I noticed them because a business organiation I belong to, Support Services Alliance (SSA), sent a flyer out about Energy Plus. It really did sound like a great deal...until I got my third bill and the "intro" rate was gone - I switched 2 business accounts and my personal account and I went for an 11 month ride. I finally found a website that compared energy prices and it showed their price about half what they were charging me. When I got to the bottom of it, the intial rate quote is only a 2 month quote, after that hang on to yourself cuz you're going for a ride!!! I contacted SSA to let them know of my experience, but they're still sending out the Energy Plus flyer (got one 2 weeks ago), so I'm wondering what's in it for SSA, cuz there isn't anything in it for the consumer! RUN, DO NOT WALK, to the nearest exit on this offer!

Energy Plus Holdings - Scam, stay away from this companyEnergy Plus HoldingsUnited StatesPlease read this if you are considering switching your electric supply company to Energy Plus.

Over two years ago I switched to Energy Plus after speaking to one of their sales people. They told me I should see and an average of 7% savings over my current supplier’s charges in addition to getting 3% back into my son's Upromise account as well as a $25 signing bonus that would also go into the Upromise account. I believed Energy Plus's representation and I signed up. I now regret it and partially blame myself because I didn't’ listen to my wife. My wife knew something was wrong. She pays the utility bills and on several occasions she had told me that the electric bills seemed really high as compared to the past. I dismissed her concerns with a statement like " energy is getting more expensive, don't worry we have a good deal". I now know what an *** I was not to listen to her. Last week my wife insisted I call to have the meter checked because of how high the bill was. I did call, and was shocked when National Grid told me that in my most recent bill, I paid over 14 cents per KWH to Energy Plus when National Grid was charging a little over 5 cents.

I immediately called Energy Plus and spoke to a supervisor; this is where it gets interesting. The supervisor was apologetic and explained, that recently their cost had spiked but generally speaking, over time everything averaged out and that they offered competitive electric supply rates. I now know, that this word, "competitive” is a word Energy Plus uses a lot to cover their deception and presumably, walk the fine line of legality. Their idea and anybody else’s idea of competitive is quite different. The supervisor I spoke with did a quick review of my account and told me that indeed, over the last year I had paid a bit more than my original supplier would have charged but the year prior to that I had done well. He assured me that he would look at the last year of my bills and see if "some adjustment could be made".

While I was waiting for the supervisors call back, I did a bit of investigating myself. I googled "Energy Plus Scam" and was not surprised to see the page fill with complaints of overcharging, then I took a detailed look at my last 23 months of Electric bills, noted the amount charged by Energy Plus for my energy supply and called National Grid (previous supplier) and got the amount they had been charging during the same period. The result of this simple check dropped my jaw in disbelief. I had been taken to the cleaners. The initial three months after signing were nearly identical to my previous supplier’s rate and then for the next 20 months, Energy Plus overcharged me from 100% to over 200% more each month than what I would have been charged if I had stayed with National Grid. Most of the months, the overcharge was between 140% and 200%. I called the Energy Plus supervisor back and asked him to look back a bit further than one year because his representation that the first year of their service, I had done well, was much like the original sales spiel, not true. The supervisor then told me that, I shouldn't forget, that all the while I had been benefiting from the 3% rebate back to my son’s Upromise account and that their rate had been clearly stated on my bill. He went on to say that I could have canceled at anytime, free of charge and that as it turns out their company isn't as competitive (there's that word again) in my area as they are in other areas. I again brought up the salespersons original representation of saving an average of 7% annually on my electric supply. The supervisor acknowledged that this was a statement that his company’s sales people would sometimes make.

The following excerpt is from Energy Plus’s web site as of 2/13/2011, “As with all variable rate plans, your supply price may fluctuate on a monthly basis – lower or higher – to reflect the current state of each power market. However, in order to make an informed comparison to competitive offers, customers should average their bills over the course of several months or seasons, rather than taking a snapshot of just one month. Our goal is to be competitive with other energy suppliers and your local utility company over the long run, while offering valuable rewards.” Well, I would say that Energy Plus was not very good at meeting their goal. Notice again the frequent use of competitive in Energy Plus’s well crafted statement. The statement implies savings and in essence says you really can’t make an informed decision unless you wait through seasons of their inflated bills to make a decision. Rather insulting, Energy Plus doesn’t list any rates past or current on their web site for a good reason, it would limit the number of people they could take advantage of. They rather you take their word, regrettably I did.

The supervisor did get back to me that day, and offered me 600.00 and advised me that he didn't have to offer that. Six hundred dollars isn't close to what their overcharges amounted to. He went on to say that he was only able to go back one year in my account and that would be the best he could do.

I've severed my relationship with Energy Plus and am waiting for the check now. I fully expect the check to have some kind of statement below the endorsement area which will release them of any further liability. If that is the case I will not be signing it. Either way I will be filing a complaint with the NYS Public Service Commission (80 complaints in 2010) and perhaps the NYS Attorney General in the coming weeks. It is indeed scary that a company like this can continue to do business in NYS. Why hasn't the NYS Public Service Commission shut them down? Why have the Energy Plus, executives not been prosecuted for fraud. I hope that Upromise has or is in the process of disassociating themselves from Energy Plus.

Bottom line; be very careful with these non-mainstream energy companies. As it turns out, (after checking Public Service Commission complaints) there are many companies like Energy Plus out there, preying on good people because they can. Somehow they are allowed to continue to do business, this is truly a buyer beware industry.

To add insult to injury, when I notified Upromise of this bad player affiliation that they have as mentioned by dozens of their members on the community board in the form of overcharging complaints, here is the exact text of my e-mail exchange with Upromise customer support. It doesn't give you the sense that Upromise does a lot of checking on the character of the companies they associate with or really care once it's pointed out to them as long as Upromise is getting some of the ill gotten booty.

Dear Upromise staff.

Please stop your association with Energy Plus. Just google Energy Plus
Scam to see all the complaints about their rates. They misrepresent the
savings in a huge way.The last 20 months I was overcharged by 100 to
over 175% as compared with the utility I had switched from for the same
variable rate product.
Your own community board tells story after story of the fraud that is
being perpetrated on your members. It is Upromise that introduced me to
Energy Plus.My post appears as user sge411.

Energy Plus Holdings - ScamEnergy Plus Holdings United StatesEnergy Plus Holdings sends out promotions for free flyer miles and then overcharges for elctrical service. Im my case they charged 20 cents a kilowatt hour compared to 5.7 cents I was paying before with NYSEG. My bill went from $40 to $140!! More than triple what I was paying before.

Energy Plus Holdings - Don't do itEnergy Plus HoldingsUnited StatesFirst of all the rates are at least twice as much as the local company in NY. The second thing is that it is impossible to disconnect their service. On their bill they have a phone number that only works during the weekend when their office is closed. During the week it only rings and eventually you get disconnected. The best way but not an easy way is to call the number pretending that you want to sign up and then ask for a supervisor. This takes a long time as well but it works. Dont let them place you on hold.

For those of you still considering switching from your local electric supplier to resellers like Energy Plus, read this article about energy deregulated markets. Upromise, maybe now you will reconsider your association with Energy Plus. http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2011/07/23/For-Many-Energy-DeReg-Was-a-Dismal-Failure.aspx#pa...

Energy Plus Holdings - ScamEnergy Plus HoldingsConnecticutUnited StatesEnergy Plus markets their rates as being cheaper then your standard utility bill. And they are for the "introductory" period. After the introductory period, they jack your rate up to a premium rate to your standard provider. Even worse, when CT lowered electricity rates across the board in late 2011, Energy Plus actually raised my rate! Energy Plus raised my rate by 15% to almost 15c/kwh, when CLP the standard provider lowered theirs to 8.2c/kwh. Everybody in the industry went down, and Energy Plus went up. Go figure. They had no legitimate explanation. I ended up switching to Dominion and received a rate that was 50% lower then what Energy Plus was charging me. Be careful, these guys will screw you!

ENERGY PLUS TERMS OF SERVICE FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS SUPPLY 


	We appreciate your business. This document is a contract between us, Energy Plus, and you that allows us to switch your electricity and natural gas account(s) to our service. It describes the nature of our service with you and provides important information for you to be aware of. We will begin supplying your electricity and natural gas under this contract, but your utility will continue to be responsible for delivering your electricity and natural gas sending you a bill for both of our services.




				Summary of Important Information





Length of Your Commitment

				Month-to-Month 



Price for Your Electricity

				You'll receive a promotional electric supply price for your first three bills and your price will be variable after that.



Price for Your Natural Gas

				You'll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility's natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes.



Applicable Fees

				None



Your Right to Rescind

				New customers have 7 calendar days to rescind this contract. Existing customers entering into a new contract have 3 business days to rescind. This is called your “Right to Rescind” period, which means you will not start service with us until after this period. 



Your Right to Cancel

				Once service has started, you may cancel by contacting us. It may take one or two billing cycles before the cancellation is finalized, depending on your utility’s timeframes. 





A. Important Information 



Length of Your Commitment: Month-to-Month. We will begin providing service to you after your utility processes our request to switch your service. The switch will not occur before the expiration of your “Right to Rescind” period. Our service will continue until either of us cancels the contract.         

Price: You will receive a promotional price for your first three billing cycles with us.

For Your Electricity: The promotional electric supply price you will receive during your first three billing cycles with us will be listed in your Welcome Confirmation. For your reference, our prices include generation and transmission charges and Sales and Use Tax (SUT), but they do not include any utility distribution charges or other utility fee or charge. If you enrolled in a plan with a percentage of green power, your price includes the cost for us to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates. 

After the promotional period, your prices with us will be variable.

For Your Natural Gas: You'll receive a promotional natural gas supply price for your first three billing cycles that is 5% lower than your utility's natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. The promotional natural gas supply price works differently than the promotional electric supply price because it may change for each of your first three billing cycles in order to stay 5% lower than your utility's natural gas supply rate effective on the first day of each month for residential and commercial rate classes. If you have a residential account, any natural gas supply price comparisons we make are based on your utility's natural gas supply rate for PSE&G's RSG rate class and NJNG's RS rate class. If you have a commercial account, any natural gas supply price comparisons we make are based on your utility's natural gas supply rate for PSE&G's GSG/LVG rate class and NJNG's GSS rate class. For your reference, our prices include natural gas supply and transportation charges and Sales and Use Tax (SUT), but they do not include any utility distribution charges or other utility fee or charge.
After the promotional period, your prices with us will be variable. 

	We will determine the variable supply price in our discretion based on many different factors, which may include competitive prices, industry charges we are responsible for, applicable state and local taxes, profit margins, or other business conditions. Our current and historical prices are not an indicator of our future prices and we do not guarantee any savings. Our prices may be higher than your utility’s supply rate. No matter what, we will not increase your variable price in any given month by more than 30% from the prior month’s supply price.

Applicable Fees: None. If you are currently in a contract with another electricity and natural gas supplier, the request to switch you to our service will automatically cancel your service with the other electricity and natural gas supplier. You are responsible for any penalties the other electricity and natural gas supplier may charge.        

Right to Rescind: You have the “Right to Rescind” this contract for a limited time, which means you can cancel your request to switch your electricity and natural gas service and never start service with us. After switching your electricity and natural gas service to us, you will receive a confirmation notice from your utility to confirm your choice for us to be your electricity and natural gas supplier. If you are a new customer, you can rescind for up to seven calendar days from the date of that notice from your utility by calling your utility at the contact information listed below. If you are a current customer entering into a new contract with us, you have the right to rescind without penalty within three business days of receipt of this contract by calling us at 1-877-866-9193. This contract is not binding until your “Right to Rescind” period has ended with no action on your part to rescind the contract.        

Your Right to Cancel: We will not charge you for starting or stopping service. You may cancel this contract without having to pay any cancellation fee by calling us at our contact information listed below. We will request that the utility cancel your service with us, but the utility controls the effective date of your cancellation. The effective date is usually the next date that your meter is read after the utility has processed our request to cancel your service with us. If you do cancel this contract, you may forfeit some of the rewards that we describe in your Welcome Confirmation, and you will be responsible for unpaid balances as of the cancellation date. This contract may also be cancelled without any penalties if you should pass away or in the event that you move, relocate, or have a disability that prevents you from paying for service with forty-eight (48) hours’ notice.   

Our Right to Cancel: We have the right to cancel this contract for any reason as long as we give you thirty days' written notice, but if we are canceling the contract due to your conduct or your breach of this contract, you will have an opportunity to fix this condition within the thirty days. Your utility will control the effective date of our cancellation request, but this is usually the next date that your meter is read. If your utility terminates your service, this contract will be automatically cancelled.    

Your Authorization to Release Your Information: This contract provides authorization for your utility to release all information regarding your electricity and natural gas account to us and for us to contact you about our other products and services or share information about your account with any designated rewards partner or with any third-party vendor we use to provide services and rewards to you. We reserve the right to share information with our affiliates, to the extent permitted by law.       

Electronic Communication: If you provide us with your Email address, you are consenting to this contract and other forms of communication being provided to you in electronic form and you must provide us with any update to your valid Email address should it change. You are required to notify us of any change in Email address and/or any withdrawal of consent for the electronic transmission of contracts or other customer information. If you enroll electronically, please note that our website and application is best viewed in Internet Explorer 8.0 or higher.      

Billing: Your local utility is responsible for sending you a bill that includes the charges for our service and charges for the utility’s service. The bill that the utility sends should include a separate line item for our service. Under this contract, you agree to pay your utility directly for our service, but if you fail to make a payment for 120 days, we may bill you separately for any unpaid charges from us. In that event, you agree to pay the costs we incur to collect any amounts owed to us, which could include reasonable attorneys’ fees.

	You also agree to review your bills in a timely manner, and if there are any inaccuracies with the portion of the bill for our services, you agree to notify us within ninety days after the date of the bill. If we do not hear from you, you are agreeing that the billed amounts are correct and you are waiving any right to dispute the billed amounts to the extent permitted by law.    

Taxes: Any applicable tax charges are included on the one bill you will receive from your utility. If you are exempt from any taxes, you are responsible for requesting an exemption by filing all required documentation with us and/or your utility.    

Contract Details: Energy Plus Holdings LLC supplies your electricity and our subsidiary, Energy Plus Natural Gas LLC supplies your natural gas. We use “Energy Plus”, “we”, “us”, or “our” to refer to both of us for the purposes of this contract. We use “you” or “your” to refer to you, the customer.

	This contract is for the sale and purchase of all of your electricity and natural gas for the residential account(s) listed in your Welcome Confirmation (letter or email). By entering into this contract, you are authorizing us to take the steps necessary to switch your electricity and natural gas supply service to us, and you agree to appoint us as your agent to acquire the necessary information to meet your electricity and natural gas needs as required by your “utility”, which we use to refer to your local distribution company. Your utility is responsible for the delivery of electricity and natural gas to you and we are not. This contract and the Welcome Confirmation (letter or email) you received create your entire contract with us and replace any prior oral or written statements or representations.     

	Contract Changes: We can only change a material term of this contract with your consent, and we will obtain your approval before making any material change. We will not change or alter the waiver of jury trial provision under any circumstances, and any changes to this contract must be made in writing.    

Customer Complaints: If you have questions about our prices or our service, you should call us at the contact information listed below. If you are not satisfied with the response from our Customer Care representative, you may ask that your questions be referred to one of our supervisors, who will respond promptly. If you remain unsatisfied with our attempts to resolve the issue, you may seek assistance from the NJ BPU or request information from the NJ BPU regarding your consumer protection rights.

Assignment: We may sell, transfer, pledge or assign the accounts, revenues or proceeds associated with this contract in connection with any financial contract, and we may assign the rights and obligations under this contract to another energy supplier consistent with applicable law. You may not assign this contract.    

No Reliance: You acknowledge that (1) you are not relying on any advice, statements, recommendations or representations of ours other than the written representations in this contract; (2) that you consulted with your own advisors to the extent you deemed necessary; and (3) that you understand the risks of entering into this contract, including the risk that our prices may be higher than your utility’s rates. You acknowledge that you are capable and willing to assume those risks (whether financial, economic or otherwise) and that you have made your own decision to enter into this contract.    

Force Majeure: We will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide electricity and natural gas supply to you pursuant to this contract, but we do not guarantee a continuous supply of electricity and natural gas. Certain Force Majeure events outside of our control may cause interruptions in service. If a Force Majeure event prevents us from performing any of our obligations in any way, our performance shall be excused for the duration of such event, and we will not be liable for damages associated with any delay or failure to perform as a result. "Force Majeure" includes, without limitation, acts outside of our control, sabotage, riots or civil disturbances, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of vandalism, terrorist acts, natural disasters, explosions, fires, or similarly cataclysmic occurrence, failure, shortage or unavailability of generating units or transmission facilities, nonperformance by your local utility, or any change in law or any other action by a governmental authority that materially impairs our ability to perform our obligations under this contract. We will give you reasonably prompt notice of any Force Majeure occurrence.     

Severability: Each provision of this contract is made subject to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any are held to be unenforceable or invalid by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, we will negotiate an equitable adjustment to or an amendment of the affected provisions with you with a view toward effecting the purpose of this contract. In this case, the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.    

LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY AND DAMAGES: THE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS PROVIDED UNDER THIS CONTRACT WILL MEET THE QUALITY STANDARDS OF YOUR UTILITY. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY US. WE HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS NOR ANY ASSOCIATED LOSS OR DAMGAGE RESULTING FROM SUCH INTERRUPTIONS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY NEW JERSEY LAW, LIABILITIES NOT EXCUSED BY REASON OF FORCE MAJEURE OR OTHERWISE SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES. WE WILL BEAR NO LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMGAGES OR LOST PROFITS. THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES ARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES OF THE HARM OR LOSS, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE.    

ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY NEW JERSEY LAW, ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT, SHALL BE FINALLY RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (“AAA”) CONDUCTED UNDER THE AAA COMMERCIAL RULES AND THE CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES, OR, AT THE ELECTION OF EITHER PARTY, BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS SECTION OF SPECIAL CIVIL PART OF THE CIVIL DIVISION, SUPERIOR COURT OF NEW JERSEY (“SMALL CLAIMS COURT”), IF THE DISPUTE OR CLAIM IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ITS JURISDICTION. BY ENTERING INTO THIS CONTRACT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHTS TO SEEK REMEDIES IN COURT, OTHER THAN IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, AND THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY IN ARBITRATION IS LIMITED AND THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS.

AAA MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. IN THE EVENT THE PROHIBITION ON CLASS ARBITRATION IS DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. JUDGMENT ON THE ARBITRATOR’S AWARD CAN BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THIS AGREEMENT EVIDENCES A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE, AND THUS THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS PROVISION. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  

Other Provisions: This contract can change based on any future legislation, orders, rules, regulations or your local utility tariff or policy changes.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Composite Score:





                        Energy Plus Holdings, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 5 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
