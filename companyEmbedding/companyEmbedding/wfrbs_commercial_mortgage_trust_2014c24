      Fitch Affirms WFRBS 2014-C24
    





October 26, 2016 04:55 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 16 classes of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities, Inc.'s WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust Series 2014-C24 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A full list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to generally overall stable performance. The 
      stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since 
      issuance, therefore the original rating analysis was considered in 
      affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the 
      pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.7% to $1.22 
      billion from $1.23 billion at issuance. No loans have been defeased, and 
      interest shortfalls are currently affecting class G.
    

      Overall Stable Performance: The transaction's overall performance 
      remains stable and continues to be in-line with issuance expectations. 
      However, one loan (0.3%) was transferred to the special servicer in 
      August 2016 for payment default.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by only 9.3% of 
      the initial pool balance prior to maturity. Approximately 38.5% of the 
      pool is full term interest only, 41.6% of the pool is partial interest 
      only and 19.9% of the pool consists of amortizing balloon loans.
    

      Specially Serviced Loan: Currently, there is one specially serviced loan 
      (0.3%). The loan transferred to special servicing in August 2016 for 
      imminent monetary default due to the declining oil and gas economy which 
      has significantly impacted the Bakken market and has resulted in 
      approximately a 50% decline in occupancy and rents at the property.
    

      Lower Loan Concentration: Loan concentration is lower than that of other 
      recent transactions. The largest loan represents 9.6% of the pool, and 
      the top 10 loans represent 46.5%.
    

      High Retail and Florida Concentrations: Twenty-one loans (40.8%) are 
      secured by retail properties. Fourteen loans (22.5%), including two top 
      10 loans, are located in Florida.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, the 
      St. Johns Town Center pooled note representing 9.6% of the pool, was 
      assigned a Fitch credit opinion of 'AA-'sf on a stand-alone basis at 
      issuance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to generally overall stable performance. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.7% to $1.22 billion from $1.23 billion at issuance. No loans have been defeased, and interest shortfalls are currently affecting class G.Overall Stable Performance: The transaction's overall performance remains stable and continues to be in-line with issuance expectations. However, one loan (0.3%) was transferred to the special servicer in August 2016 for payment default.Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by only 9.3% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity. Approximately 38.5% of the pool is full term interest only, 41.6% of the pool is partial interest only and 19.9% of the pool consists of amortizing balloon loans.Specially Serviced Loan: Currently, there is one specially serviced loan (0.3%). The loan transferred to special servicing in August 2016 for imminent monetary default due to the declining oil and gas economy which has significantly impacted the Bakken market and has resulted in approximately a 50% decline in occupancy and rents at the property.Lower Loan Concentration: Loan concentration is lower than that of other recent transactions. The largest loan represents 9.6% of the pool, and the top 10 loans represent 46.5%.High Retail and Florida Concentrations: Twenty-one loans (40.8%) are secured by retail properties. Fourteen loans (22.5%), including two top 10 loans, are located in Florida.Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, the St. Johns Town Center pooled note representing 9.6% of the pool, was assigned a Fitch credit opinion of 'AA-'sf on a stand-alone basis at issuance.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:WFRBS 2014-C24--$25 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$55.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$86.3 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$240 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$286.3 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$59.2 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$99.2 million class A-S* at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest-only X-A class at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$44.9 million class B* at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$32.6 million class C* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$176.7 class PEX* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$72 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest-only class X-C at 'BB-sf; Outlook Stable:--$25.8 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest-only class X-D at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$10.9 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.*The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for class PEX certificates, and class PEX certificates may be exchanged for the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.Fitch does not rate the class X-B, X-E, G, SJ-A, SJ-B, SJ-C and SJ-D certificates.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)Read Morehttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchWFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-C24 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/872486Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013804Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013804Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

	(1) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan information to the properties based upon the Cut-Off Date balance of each property as disclosed in

	the offering document.
































	(2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if applicable, and

	the Maturity Date.
































	(3) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures become available from borrowers on an asset level. As NCF DSCRs are reported in the Loan

	Periodic File, the most current NCF DSCR is used in the stratification section of this report. If no updated NCF DSCRs are reported, the most current NOI DSCR is used. If no

	updated DSCR information is provided, then information from the offering document is used. If the DSCRs reported by the Master Servicer are based on a period of less than 12

	months, they are normalized based on the Most Recent Financial as of Start and End Dates reported in the Loan Periodic File. The DSCR information was provided to the

	Certificate Administrator by the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator has not independently confirmed the accuracy of such information. The Scheduled Balance Totals

	reflect the aggregate balances of all pooled loans as reported in the CREFC Loan Periodic Update File. To the extent that the Scheduled Balance Total figure for the “State” and

	“Property” stratification tables is not equal to the sum of the scheduled balance figures for each state or property, the difference is explained by loans that have been modified into

	a split loan structure. The “State” and “Property” stratification tables do not include the balance of the subordinate note (sometimes called the B-piece or a “hope note”) of a loan

	that has been modified into a split-loan structure. Rather, the scheduled balance for each state or property only reflects the balance of the senior note (sometimes called the Apiece)

	of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure.
