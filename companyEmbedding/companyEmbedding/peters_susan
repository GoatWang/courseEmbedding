Early life[edit]
Peters was born Suzanne Carnahan in Spokane, Washington, the elder of two children born to Robert and Abby Carnahan. Her father was a civil engineer of Irish descent while her mother was of French descent. Shortly after her birth, the Carnahan family moved to Portland, Oregon. In 1933, Robert Carnahan was killed in a car accident and the family moved to Los Angeles to live with Peters' maternal grandmother.[1][better source needed](Another source says, "... she and her mother came to Hollywood when Suzanne was still an infant."[2])
Peters was educated at Laird Hall School for Girls, the LaRue School in Azusa, California, and Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy. "Susan, during her years in high school, worked after hours in a Los Angeles department store, earning money to help the family."[3] While in her senior year at Hollywood High School, Peters began taking drama classes and signed with an agent. After graduating in June 1939, she won a scholarship to the Max Reinhardt School of Dramatic Arts. While performing in a showcase at the school, she was spotted by a talent scout for Warner Bros. and given a screen test. Warner Bros. signed Peters to a contract.[1]
Career[edit]




Tish trailer (1942)






Random Harvest trailer (1942)


For the first two years of her career, she used her given name of Suzanne Carnahan and played small, often uncredited parts in films such as Meet John Doe (1941). Warner Bros. eventually convinced her to change her name to Susan Peters. By 1942, however, Warner Bros. chose not to renew her contract. A few months after being dropped by Warner Bros., she was contacted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios to test for a supporting role in the film Tish. She won the role and also signed a contract with M-G-M.[1] Her first substantial role, in Random Harvest (1942), earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[4]
Further impressed, MGM began to groom her for starring roles, casting her in several lesser productions that allowed her to learn her craft. A starring role in Song of Russia (1943) earned her critical acclaim. In 1944 she was one of ten actors who were elevated from "featured player" status to the studio's official "star" category; the others included Esther Williams, Laraine Day, Kathryn Grayson, Van Johnson, Margaret O'Brien, Ginny Simms, Robert Walker, Gene Kelly, and George Murphy. An official portrait taken of MGM's contracted players during this period prominently features Peters sharing the front row with the head of the studio himself, Louis B. Mayer, and alongside such actors as James Stewart, Mickey Rooney, Margaret Sullavan, Katharine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, and Greer Garson.
Injury and later career[edit]
Peters married actor and film director Richard Quine on November 7, 1943. On January 1, 1945, Peters and Quine were duck hunting when a rifle accidentally discharged and she was injured; the bullet lodged in her spinal cord.[5] The accident left her permanently paralyzed from the waist down, which required her to use a wheelchair.[6] Her mother, who had maintained a bedside vigil during her stay in the hospital, died in December 1945.
MGM continued to pay her salary, but, unable to find suitable projects, Peters subsequently left the studio. She returned to the screen in the lead role in Columbia's The Sign of the Ram (1948),[7] but the film failed to win an audience. She toured in stage productions of The Glass Menagerie and The Barretts of Wimpole Street, and her performances were highly regarded[by whom?], but her disability made her a difficult actress to cast.[1] Peters' final role was as the title character in the live television drama Miss Susan. The show was canceled after Peters' health began to decline.[4]
Later years and death[edit]
Peters and her husband Richard Quine adopted a son, Timothy Richard, in 1946. They separated in March 1947 with Peters claiming that Quine was cruel and would not speak to her for days at a time. They were divorced in September 1948.[8] Following her divorce and the end of her career, Peters suffered from depression.[citation needed]
On October 23, 1952, Peters died at Memorial Hospital in Visalia, California at the age of 31. Peters' doctor attributed her death to a chronic kidney infection, a complication caused by her paralysis, and bronchial pneumonia. He also noted that her death was hastened by dehydration and starvation because, in the last few weeks of her life, Peters had "lost interest" in eating and drinking and had lost the will to live.[6] Her funeral was held on October 27 in Glendale, California, after which she was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park next to her mother.[9][10]
For her contribution to motion pictures, Susan Peters has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street.[11]

Early life[edit]
Peters was born Suzanne Carnahan in Spokane, Washington, the elder of two children born to Robert and Abby Carnahan. Her father was a civil engineer of Irish descent while her mother was of French descent. Shortly after her birth, the Carnahan family moved to Portland, Oregon. In 1933, Robert Carnahan was killed in a car accident and the family moved to Los Angeles to live with Peters' maternal grandmother.[1][better source needed](Another source says, "... she and her mother came to Hollywood when Suzanne was still an infant."[2])
Peters was educated at Laird Hall School for Girls, the LaRue School in Azusa, California, and Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy. "Susan, during her years in high school, worked after hours in a Los Angeles department store, earning money to help the family."[3] While in her senior year at Hollywood High School, Peters began taking drama classes and signed with an agent. After graduating in June 1939, she won a scholarship to the Max Reinhardt School of Dramatic Arts. While performing in a showcase at the school, she was spotted by a talent scout for Warner Bros. and given a screen test. Warner Bros. signed Peters to a contract.[1]
Career[edit]




Tish trailer (1942)






Random Harvest trailer (1942)


For the first two years of her career, she used her given name of Suzanne Carnahan and played small, often uncredited parts in films such as Meet John Doe (1941). Warner Bros. eventually convinced her to change her name to Susan Peters. By 1942, however, Warner Bros. chose not to renew her contract. A few months after being dropped by Warner Bros., she was contacted by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios to test for a supporting role in the film Tish. She won the role and also signed a contract with M-G-M.[1] Her first substantial role, in Random Harvest (1942), earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[4]
Further impressed, MGM began to groom her for starring roles, casting her in several lesser productions that allowed her to learn her craft. A starring role in Song of Russia (1943) earned her critical acclaim. In 1944 she was one of ten actors who were elevated from "featured player" status to the studio's official "star" category; the others included Esther Williams, Laraine Day, Kathryn Grayson, Van Johnson, Margaret O'Brien, Ginny Simms, Robert Walker, Gene Kelly, and George Murphy. An official portrait taken of MGM's contracted players during this period prominently features Peters sharing the front row with the head of the studio himself, Louis B. Mayer, and alongside such actors as James Stewart, Mickey Rooney, Margaret Sullavan, Katharine Hepburn, Hedy Lamarr, and Greer Garson.
Injury and later career[edit]
Peters married actor and film director Richard Quine on November 7, 1943. On January 1, 1945, Peters and Quine were duck hunting when a rifle accidentally discharged and she was injured; the bullet lodged in her spinal cord.[5] The accident left her permanently paralyzed from the waist down, which required her to use a wheelchair.[6] Her mother, who had maintained a bedside vigil during her stay in the hospital, died in December 1945.
MGM continued to pay her salary, but, unable to find suitable projects, Peters subsequently left the studio. She returned to the screen in the lead role in Columbia's The Sign of the Ram (1948),[7] but the film failed to win an audience. She toured in stage productions of The Glass Menagerie and The Barretts of Wimpole Street, and her performances were highly regarded[by whom?], but her disability made her a difficult actress to cast.[1] Peters' final role was as the title character in the live television drama Miss Susan. The show was canceled after Peters' health began to decline.[4]
Later years and death[edit]
Peters and her husband Richard Quine adopted a son, Timothy Richard, in 1946. They separated in March 1947 with Peters claiming that Quine was cruel and would not speak to her for days at a time. They were divorced in September 1948.[8] Following her divorce and the end of her career, Peters suffered from depression.[citation needed]
On October 23, 1952, Peters died at Memorial Hospital in Visalia, California at the age of 31. Peters' doctor attributed her death to a chronic kidney infection, a complication caused by her paralysis, and bronchial pneumonia. He also noted that her death was hastened by dehydration and starvation because, in the last few weeks of her life, Peters had "lost interest" in eating and drinking and had lost the will to live.[6] Her funeral was held on October 27 in Glendale, California, after which she was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park next to her mother.[9][10]
For her contribution to motion pictures, Susan Peters has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1601 Vine Street.[11]

Page Content
About Supervisor Susan PetersSusan Peters is serving her fourth term on the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors representing the Third District after having been first elected in 2004 and re-elected in 2008, 2012, and 2016. The Third District includes the unincorporated communities of Arden Arcade, Carmichael, Fair Oaks, Foothill Farms and North Highlands as well as the neighborhoods of Campus Commons, College Greens, and Glenbrook in the City of Sacramento. In addition to the Board of Supervisors, she serves on a number of boards including the Sacramento Area Council of Governments where she served as chair during 2011, the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency which she chaired in 2009 and the Sacramento Transportation Authority where she served as chair in 2006 and 2014. On the Board of Supervisors, she has worked to insure that local government is focused on the right priorities, taxpayer monies are accountable and managed well, and decisions are based upon sound information and research to enable Sacramento County to attract new businesses, revitalize area business districts and maintain our neighborhoods. Accomplishments to date include the revitalization of the two major commercial corridors -- Fulton Avenue and Auburn Boulevard, the opening of three neighborhood parks by the Carmichael Recreation and Park District (Patriots, O’Donnell Heritage, and Jan Parks), and the completion of Phase 1 of the Hazel Avenue Improvement Project that added more vehicles lanes to relieve congestion over the American River Bridge between U.S. Highway 50 and Curragh Downs Drive in Fair Oaks. She currently is leading the effort for Phase 2 of Carmichael’s Fair Oaks Boulevard Improvement Project from Landis Avenue to Shirley Way that will add new streetscape landscaping to that section of the roadway as well as for Phase 2 of the Hazel Avenue Widening Project from Curragh Downs Drive to Sunset Avenue in Fair Oaks.  Susan is also supporting the expansion of Eastern Oak Community Park in Arden Arcade by the Mission Oaks Recreation and Park District. Recognizing the need to maintain the quality of residential life in the unincorporated suburban area, Susan approved the creation and on-going implementation of the Department of Transportation’s Neighborhood Traffic Management Program that allows residents to develop plans for their neighborhoods to combat speeding and cut-through traffic. She also was successful in forging a partnership with the California Highway Patrol in creating a maximum enforcement program targeting speeders on major roadways in the unincorporated area. Another significant initiative she promotes is the annual “Pothole Sweeps Week” conducted in the fall by the Department of Transportation as part of a concentrated effort to identify and fill potholes in order to protect and preserve the transportation infrastructure in preparation for the inclement winter weather. Susan is a former Board Chairman of the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce where she spearheaded efforts to locate Raley Field in West Sacramento. She also was a founding member of the Northern California World Trade Center, and a past president of the Sacramento Theater Company. As businesswoman, Susan began her career in banking and later worked beside her now late husband Peter McCuen at McCuen Properties as treasurer for the company. Their efforts led to a redefining of the Sacramento region, including managing the successful reuse of Mather Air Force base into the now thriving Mather Commerce Center. In addition to her elected duties, she serves as Board Chair of the Leland Stanford Mansion Foundation which restored the historic home of California’s eighth governor. Susan’s connection to the Third District dates back when she grew up in the Old Foothill Farms area. She currently resides in Arden Arcade and formerly lived in Carmichael and Fair Oaks.

Susan Sarandon, original 3.5 x 5 photograph by celebrity photographer Peter Warrack. Vintage photograph from the original negative. Printed by Warrack as part of his personal archive. Previously unpublished.
In his early 20's, Peter Warrack lived in London, Rome, and Athens working for entertainment magazines and writing articles about events that he attended, like the Cannes Film Festival. It was during this period of time that his interest in photography began to develop. Over the years, Peter began to amass a very extensive collection of photographs of people he met. He attended many events and met many famed individuals of the time. He always took the time to research people before meeting them and was able to talk with them about their careers, their travels and even their families. 
Verso bears official "Peter Warrack Archive" ink stamping. In very good condition, though might have light mounting residue on verso from previous mounting.
Provenance: From the Peter Warrack Estate.

Satisfaction 100% Guaranteed
