Source: BlackRock Solutions. The fund credit quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AM (highest) to D (lowest). All securities except for those labeled "Not Rated" or "Other Fixed Income" have been rated by a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization ("NRSRO"). For purposes of this presentation, when ratings are available from more than one NRSRO, the highest rating is used. Guggenheim Investments converts ratings to the equivalent S&P rating. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low credit quality.All data is subject to change on a daily basis.

See the Fund’s Section 19a-1 letters, if any, located on the Fund's website under the "Fund News" section of the News & Literature Tab for estimates of distribution sources other than income. See the "Tax Information" on the Fund’s website under the Distributions Tab for final characterization of the Fund's distributions for federal income tax purposes.
The dividend history represents dividends that were paid by the Fund and is not a guarantee of the Fund's future dividend-paying ability. If you participate in the "DRIP" (the Dividend Reinvestment Plan) your income is reinvested in additional common shares.
For listed closed-end funds, the reinvestment price is determined by one of two scenarios. One, if the common shares are trading at a discount, the DRIP price is the weighted average cost to purchase the common shares from the NYSE or elsewhere. Lastly, if the common shares are trading at a premium, the DRIP price is the determined by taking either the higher of the NAV or approximately 95% of the common share price.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures shown. Since Inception returns assume a purchase of common shares at each Fund’s initial offering price for market price returns or the Fund’s initial net asset value (NAV) for NAV returns. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized. All distributions are assumed to be reinvested either in accordance with the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for market price returns or NAV for NAV returns. Until the DRIP price is available from the Plan Agent, the market price returns reflect the reinvestment at the closing market price on the last business day of the month. Once the DRIP is available around mid-month, the market price returns are updated to reflect reinvestment at the DRIP price. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Please refer to the most recent annual or semi-annual report for additional information.
Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.
1 Latest declared distribution per share annualized and divided by the current share price.
2 Distributions may be paid from sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short term capital gains, long term capital gains or return of capital. If a distribution consists of something other than ordinary income, a 19(a) notice detailing the anticipated source(s) of the distribution will be made available. The 19(a) notice will be posted to the Fund’s website and to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation so that brokers can distribute such notices to Shareholders of the Fund. Section 19(a) notices are provided for informational purposes only and not for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions in a particular year will be made after the end of the year. This information is not legal or tax advice. Consult a professional regarding your specific legal or tax matters.
3 Represents the amount of financial leverage the Fund currently employs as a percentage of total Fund assets.
4 Expense ratios are annualized and reflect the funds operating expense, excluding interest expense, or in the case of a fund with a fee waiver, net operating expense, as of the most recent annual or semi-annual report. The expense ratio, based on common assets, including interest expense was 1.49%.



Investment Objective
Guggenheim Taxable Municipal Managed Duration Trust (the “Trust”) is a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Trust’s primary investment objective is to provide current income with a secondary objective of long-term capital appreciation. The Trust cannot ensure investors that it will achieve its investment objectives.
The Trust seeks to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal securities, including securities known as “Build America Bonds” (or “BABs”). Under normal market conditions:

The Trust will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in taxable municipal securities, including BABs.
The Trust may invest up to 20% of its Managed Assets in securities other than taxable municipal securities, including municipal securities the interest income from which is exempt from regular federal income tax (sometimes referred to as “tax-exempt municipal securities”), asset-backed securities (“ABS”), senior loans and other income producing securities.
The Trust will not invest more than 25% of its Managed Assets in municipal securities in any one state of origin.
The Trust will not invest more than 15% of its Managed Assets in municipal securities that, at the time of investment, are illiquid.


Frequently Asked Questions
What are Build America Bonds?
Build America Bonds (“BABs”) are taxable municipal debt obligations issued pursuant to the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (the “Act”). BABs provide state and local governments with an alternative method of financing capital projects such as public buildings, schools and transportation infrastructure, which may be more affordable than issuing tax-exempt municipal securities. To help offset issuers’ borrowing costs, the U.S. Treasury Department (“Treasury”) subsidizes 35% of the interest paid on BABs. Issuers can elect to receive a direct payment from the Treasury (via the issuance of “direct payment BABs”) or to provide bondholders with a tax credit (via the issuance of “tax credit BABs”). Such subsidies may allow issuers to issue BABs that pay interest rates that are expected to be competitive with the rates paid by private bond issuers in the taxable fixed-income market. The BABs program allowed state and local governments to issue an unlimited amount of taxable debt through December 31, 2010, however, the issuance of BABs was discontinued on December 31, 2010. Under the sequestration process under the Budget Control Act of 2011, automatic spending cuts that became effective on March 1, 2013 reduced the federal subsidy for BABs and other subsidized taxable municipal bonds. The reduced federal subsidy has been extended through 2024. The subsidy payments were reduced by 7.3% in 2015 and by 6.8% in 2016.
How does GBAB seek to reduce the portfolio's effective duration?
Through a proprietary duration management trading strategy, the Trust will utilize a two-pronged approach that seeks to reduce the portfolio’s effective duration to generally less than 10 years.
Interest-Rate Swaps. GPIM will initially seek to take advantage of the relatively flat portions of the U.S. Treasury yield curve that appear to offer favorable decreases in duration without significant yield concessions. For example, this may be accomplished by combining the sale of interest-rate swaps on the long end of the yield curve with the purchase of interest-rate swaps on the intermediate portion of the yield curve. To take advantage of cost anomalies, GPIM will have the flexibility to opportunistically manage duration and may trade across other yield curves that exhibit similarly wide duration spreads with low spreads in yields.
Fixed-Income Sector and Security Selection. The Trust may invest up to 20% of the portfolio’s assets in income securities other than taxable municipal securities, which may consist of short-duration fixedincome securities. Initially, GPIM anticipates focusing such investments in asset-backed securities, senior loans and high-yield fixed-income securities, although the types of shortduration fixed-income securities in which the Trust may invest may vary significantly over time. This approach may help to decrease the overall duration of the Trust’s portfolio while also potentially adding incremental yield.
The Trust may incur cost in implementing the duration management strategy. There can be no assurance that GPIM’s duration management strategy will be successful in managing the duration of the Trust’s portfolio or helping the Trust to achieve its investment objectives.
Describe the differences between closed-end and open-end funds?
An open-end fund may be purchased or sold at NAV, plus sales charge in some cases. An open-end fund will issue new shares when an investor wants to purchases shares in the fund and will sell assets to redeem shares when an investor wants to sell shares. When selling an open-end fund the price the seller receives is established at the close of the market when the NAV is calculated. Unlike the open-end fund, a closed-end fund has a limited number of shares outstanding and trades on an exchange at the market price based on supply and demand. An investor may purchase or sell shares at market price while the exchange is open. The common shares may trade at a discount or premium to the NAV.
Why a Leveraged Fund?
Leveraged closed-end funds offer investors the opportunity to purchase shares of a fund whose dividend yields generally are designed to be higher than those of similar, unleveraged investments. At the same time, leverage introduces or heightens certain investment risks. As a result, understanding leverage, its benefits and risks, plays an important role in determining whether a leveraged Fund is the right investment. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including: the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Fund’s common shares, fluctuations in the dividend rates, and possible increased operating costs, which may reduce the Fund’s total return.
What is the DRIP and how is its price determined?
DRIP is the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The DRIP price is the cost per share for all participants in the reinvestment plan. The DRIP price is determined by one of two scenarios. One, if the Common Shares are trading at a discount, the DRIP price is the weighted average cost to purchase the Common Shares from the NYSE or elsewhere. Lastly, if the Common Shares are trading at a premium, the DRIP price is the determined either the higher of the NAV or approximately 95% of the Common Share price.

Risks
Investment in the Trust involves special risk considerations, which are summarized below. The Trust is designed for long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. The Trust is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Trust’s performance and the value of its investments will vary in response to changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a municipal security and other market factors.
No Operating History. The Trust is a newly-organized, diversified, closed-end management investment company with no operating history. 
Not a Complete Investment Program. An investment in the common shares of the Trust should not be considered a complete investment program. The Trust is intended for long-term investors seeking current income and capital appreciation. The Trust is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish to play short-term swings in the stock market. Each common shareholder should take into account the Trust’s investment objective as well as the common shareholder’s other investments when considering an investment in the Trust.
Investment and Market Risk. The Trust is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in the common shares of the Trust represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the Trust. The value of those securities may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The value of the securities owned by the Trust will affect the value of the common shares. At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than your original investment, including the reinvestment of Trust dividends and distributions.
Management Risk. The Trust is subject to management risk because it has an actively managed portfolio. The Sub-Adviser will apply investment techniques and risk analysis in making investment decisions for the Trust, but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results. The Trust will invest in securities that the Sub-Adviser believes are undervalued or mispriced as a result of recent economic events, such as market dislocations, the inability of other investors to evaluate risk and forced selling. If the Sub-Adviser’s perception of the value of a security is incorrect, your investment in the Trust may lose value.
Build America Bonds Risk. BABs are a new form of municipal financing. The BABs market is smaller and less diverse than the broader municipal securities market. In addition, because the relevant provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were not extended, bonds issued after December 31, 2010 cannot qualify as BABs. Therefore, the number of BABs available in the market is limited. It is impossible to predict the extent to which a market for such bonds will develop and there can be no assurance that BABs will be actively traded. Reduced liquidity may negatively affect the value of the BABs. Because issuers of direct payment BABs held in the Trust’s portfolio receive reimbursement from the U.S. Treasury with respect to interest payments on bonds, there is a risk that those municipal issuers will not receive timely payment from the U.S. Treasury and may remain obligated to pay the full interest due on direct payment BABs held by the Trust. Under the sequestration process under the Budget Control Act of 2011, automatic spending cuts that became effective on March 1, 2013 reduced the federal subsidy for BABs and other subsidized taxable municipal bonds. The reduced federal subsidy has been extended through 2024. The subsidy payments were reduced by 7.3% in 2015 and by 6.8% in 2016. Furthermore, it is possible that a municipal issuer may fail to comply with the requirements to receive the direct pay subsidy or that a future Congress may further reduce or terminate the subsidy altogether. In addition, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) contains a general offset rule (the “IRS Offset Rule”) which allows for the possibility that subsidy payments to be received by issuers of BABs may be subject to offset against amounts owed by them to the federal government. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) may audit the agencies issuing BABs and such audits may, among other things, examine the price at which BABs are initially sold to investors. If the IRS concludes that a BAB was mis-priced based on its audit, it could disallow all or a portion of the interest subsidy received by the issuer of the BAB. The IRS Offset Rule and the disallowance of any interest subsidy as a result of an IRS audit could potentially adversely affect a BABs issuer’s credit rating, and adversely affect the issuer’s ability to repay or refinance BABs. This, in turn, could adversely affect the ratings and value of the BABs held by the Trust and the Trust’s net asset value. The IRS has withheld subsidies from several states and municipalities. Because the BABs program is new, certain aspects of the BABs program may be subject to additional federal or state level guidance or subsequent legislation. For example, the IRS or U.S. Treasury could impose restrictions or limitations on the payments received. It is not known what additional procedures will be implemented with respect to direct payment BABs, if any, nor is it known what effect such possible procedures would have on the BABs market.
General Municipal Securities Market Risk. Investing in the municipal securities market involves certain risks. The municipal market is one in which dealer firms make markets in bonds on a principal basis using their proprietary capital, and during the recent market turmoil these firms’ capital was severely constrained. As a result, some firms were unwilling to commit their capital to purchase and to serve as a dealer for municipal bonds. Certain municipal securities may not be registered with the SEC or any state securities commission and will not be listed on any national securities exchange. The amount of public information available about municipal securities is generally less than for corporate equities or bonds, and the Trust’s investment performance may therefore be more dependent on the sub-adviser’s analytical abilities. The secondary market for municipal securities, particularly the below investment-grade bonds in which the Trust may invest, also tends to be less developed or liquid than many other securities markets, which may adversely affect the Trust’s ability to sell its municipal securities at attractive prices or at prices approximating those at which the Trust currently values them. Municipal securities may contain redemption provisions, which may allow the securities to be called or redeemed prior to their stated maturity, potentially resulting in the distribution of principal and a reduction in subsequent interest distributions. Many state and municipal governments are currently under significant economic and financial stress and may not be able to satisfy their obligations. The ability of municipal issuers to make timely payments of interest and principal may be diminished during general economic downturns and as governmental cost burdens are reallocated among federal, state and local governments. The taxing powers of any governmental entity may be limited by provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entity’s credit will depend on many factors, including the entity’s tax base, the extent to which the entity relies on federal or state aid, and other factors which are beyond the entity’s control. In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. Issuers of municipal securities might seek protection under Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Although similar to other bankruptcy proceedings in some respects, municipal bankruptcy is significantly different in that there is no provision in the law for liquidation of the assets of the municipality and distribution of the proceeds to creditors. Municipal bankruptcy is available to issuers in certain states. In states in which municipal bankruptcy is not presently available, new legislation would be required to permit a municipal issuer in such state to file for bankruptcy. Municipalities must voluntarily seek protection under the Bankruptcy Code; municipal bankruptcy proceedings cannot be commenced by creditors. Due to the severe limitations placed upon the power of the bankruptcy court in Chapter 9 cases, the bankruptcy court generally is not as active in managing a municipal bankruptcy case as it is in corporate reorganizations. The bankruptcy court cannot appoint a trustee nor interfere with the municipality’s political or governmental powers or with its properties or revenues, for example by ordering reductions in expenditures, increases in taxes, or sales of property, without the municipality’s consent. In addition, the municipality can continue to borrow in the ordinary course without bankruptcy court approval if it is able to do so without affecting the rights of existing creditors. Neither creditors nor courts may control the affairs of the municipality indirectly by proposing a readjustment plan that would effectively determine the municipality’s future tax and spending decisions, so the Trust’s influence over any bankruptcy proceedings would be very limited. In the event of bankruptcy of a municipal issuer, the Trust could experience delays in collecting principal and interest, and the Trust may not be able to collect all principal and interest to which it is entitled. There is no provision in municipal bankruptcy proceedings for liquidation of municipal assets in order to distribute proceeds to creditors such as the Trust.
Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that one or more credit securities in the Trust’s portfolio will decline in price, or fail to pay interest or principal when due, because the issuer of the obligation experiences a decline in its financial status.
Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that credit securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates. When market interest rates rise, the market value of credit securities generally will fall.
Duration Management Risk. The Trust’s managers expect to employ investment and trading strategies to seek to maintain the leverage-adjusted duration of the Trust’s portfolio at approximately 10 years. Such strategies include, among others, security selection and the use of financial products. Financial products may include US treasury swaps, total return swaps and futures contracts, among others. During the latest semi-annual period the Trust’s managers used a combination of Corporate Bonds, Asset Backed Securities, Collateralized Loan Obligations, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, Preferred Stock, Term Loans and other similar instruments to achieve a leverage-adjusted duration of approximately 10 years. These investments were also used to provide the Fund with protection against interest rate volatility while providing income to the Fund. (Duration is a measure of a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, expressed in years. Duration is a weighted average of the times that interest payments and the final return of principal are received. The weights are the amounts of the payments discounted by the yield to maturity of the bond.)
Financial Leverage Risk. The Trust initially expects to employ Financial Leverage through Indebtedness and/or engaging in reverse repurchase agreements. The Adviser and the Sub-Adviser anticipate that the use of Financial Leverage will result in higher income to Common Shareholders over time. Use of Financial Leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and capital appreciation but, at the same time, creates special risks. There can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be utilized or will be successful. Financial Leverage is a speculative technique that exposes the Trust to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not implemented. Increases and decreases in the value of the Trust’s portfolio will be magnified when the Trust uses Financial Leverage. As a result, Financial Leverage may cause greater changes in the Trust’s net asset value and returns than if Financial Leverage had not been used. The Trust will also have to pay interest on its Indebtedness, if any, which may reduce the Trust’s return. This interest expense may be greater than the Trust’s return on the underlying investment, which would negatively affect the performance of the Trust. Certain types of Indebtedness subject the Trust to covenants in credit agreements relating to asset coverage and portfolio composition requirements. Certain Indebtedness issued by the Trust also may subject the Trust to certain restrictions on investments imposed by guidelines of one or more rating agencies, which may issue ratings for such Indebtedness. Such guidelines may impose asset coverage or portfolio composition requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the 1940 Act. It is not anticipated that these covenants or guidelines will impede the Sub-Adviser from managing the Trust’s portfolio in accordance with the Trust’s investment objectives and policies. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the risks that the interest income earned on the investment of the proceeds will be less than the interest expense and Trust expenses, that the market value of the securities sold by the Trust may decline below the price at which the Trust is obligated to repurchase such securities and that the securities may not be returned to the Trust. There is no assurance that reverse repurchase agreements can be successfully employed. Dollar roll transactions involve the risk that the market value of the securities the Trust is required to purchase may decline below the agreed upon repurchase price of those securities. If the broker/dealer to whom the Trust sells securities becomes insolvent, the Trust’s right to purchase or repurchase securities may be restricted. Successful use of dollar rolls may depend upon the Sub-Adviser’s ability to correctly predict interest rates and prepayments. There is no assurance that dollar rolls can be successfully employed. Inverse floating rate securities represent beneficial interests in a special purpose trust (sometimes called a “tender option bond trust”) formed by a third party sponsor for the purpose of holding municipal bonds. Investing in such securities may expose the Trust to certain risks. In general, income on inverse floating rate securities will decrease when interest rates increase and increase when interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floating rate securities may subject the Trust to the risks of reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of principal. During the time in which the Trust is utilizing Financial Leverage, the amount of the fees paid to the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser for investment advisory services will be higher than if the Trust did not utilize Financial Leverage because the fees paid will be calculated based on the Trust’s Managed Assets, including proceeds of Financial Leverage. This may create a conflict of interest between the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, on the one hand, and the Common Shareholders, on the other hand. Common Shareholders bear the portion of the investment advisory fee attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of Financial Leverage, which means that Common Shareholders effectively bear the entire advisory fee. In order to manage this conflict of interest, the maximum level of and types of Financial Leverage used by the Trust must be approved by the Board of Trustees, and the Board of Trustees will receive regular reports from the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser regarding the Trust’s use of Financial Leverage and the effect of Financial Leverage on the management of the Trust’s portfolio and the performance of the Trust. In addition the Trust may engage in certain derivative transactions, including swaps, that have characteristics similar to leverage. To the extent the terms of any such transaction obligate the Trust to make payments, the Trust intends to earmark or segregate cash or liquid securities in an amount at least equal to the current value of the amount then payable by the Trust under the terms of such transaction in accordance with applicable interpretations of the Staff of the SEC. To the extent the terms of any such transaction obligate the Trust to deliver particular securities to extinguish the Trust’s obligations under such transactions, the Trust may “cover” its obligations under such transaction by either (i) owning the securities or collateral underlying such transactions or (ii) having an absolute and immediate right to acquire such securities or collateral without additional cash consideration (or, if additional cash consideration is required, having earmarked or segregated cash or liquid securities). Securities so segregated or designated as “cover” will be unavailable for sale by the Sub-Adviser (unless replaced by other securities qualifying for segregation or cover requirements), which may adversely effect the ability of the Trust to pursue its investment objectives
Reinvestment Risk. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Trust's portfolio will decline if and when the Trust invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below the portfolio's current earnings rate. A decline in income could affect the common shares' market price or your overall returns.
Inflation/Deflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline. In addition, during any periods of rising inflation, the dividend rates or borrowing costs associated with the Trust’s use of financial leverage would likely increase, which would tend to further reduce returns to common shareholders. Deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time—the opposite of inflation. Deflation may have an adverse affect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely, which may result in a decline in the value of the Trust’s portfolio.
Insurance Risk. The Trust may purchase municipal securities that are secured by insurance, bank credit agreements or escrow accounts. The credit quality of the companies that provide such credit enhancements will affect the value of those securities. To date, BABs have sold largely without insurance; however, as the BABs market continues to develop and evolve, insured BABs offerings may become more prevalent. Many significant providers of insurance for municipal securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the insurers’ capital and called into question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the future. While an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the rating of the underlying municipal security will be more relevant and the value of the municipal security would more closely, if not entirely, reflect such rating. In such a case, the value of insurance associated with a municipal security would decline and the insurance may not add any value. As concern has increased about the balance sheets of insurers, prices on insured bonds—especially those bonds issued by weaker underlying credits—declined. Most insured bonds are currently being valued according to their fundamentals as if they were uninsured. The insurance feature of a municipal security normally provides that it guarantees the full payment of principal and interest when due through the life of an insured obligation, but does not guarantee the market value of the insured obligation or the net asset value of the common shares attributable to such insured obligation.
Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk. Under normal market conditions, the Trust may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in securities that at the time of investment are below investment-grade quality, which are commonly referred to as “junk” bonds and are regarded as predominately speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Below investment-grade securities may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns. It is likely that an economic recession could severely disrupt the market for such securities and may have an adverse impact on the value of such securities. In addition, it is likely that any such economic downturn could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such securities to repay principal and pay interest thereon and increase the incidence of default for such securities. Lower grade securities, though high yielding, are characterized by high risk. They may be subject to certain risks with respect to the issuing entity and to greater market fluctuations than certain lower yielding, higher rated securities. The retail secondary market for lower grade securities may be less liquid than that for higher rated securities. Adverse conditions could make it difficult at times for the Trust to sell certain securities or could result in lower prices than those used in calculating the Trust’s net asset value. Because of the substantial risks associated with investments in lower grade securities, you could lose money on your investment in common shares of the Trust, both in the short-term and the long-term.
Sector Risk. The Trust may invest a significant portion of its managed assets in certain sectors which may subject the Trust to additional risk and variability. To the extent that the Trust focuses its managed assets in the hospital and healthcare facilities sector, for example, the Trust will be subject to risks associated with such sector, including adverse government regulation and reduction in reimbursement rates, as well as government approval of products and services and intense competition. Securities issued with respect to special taxing districts will be subject to various risks, including real-estate development related risks and taxpayer concentration risk. Further, the fees, special taxes or tax allocations and other revenues established to secure the obligations of securities issued with respect to special taxing districts are generally limited as to the rate or amount that may be levied or assessed and are not subject to increase pursuant to rate covenants or municipal or corporate guarantees. Charter schools and other private educational facilities are subject to various risks, including the reversal of legislation authorizing or funding charter schools, the failure to renew or secure a charter, the failure of a funding entity to appropriate necessary funds and competition from alternatives such as voucher programs. Issuers of municipal utility securities can be significantly affected by government regulation, financing difficulties, supply and demand of services or fuel and natural resource conservation. The transportation sector, including airports, airlines, ports and other transportation facilities, can be significantly affected by changes in the economy, fuel prices, maintenance, labor relations, insurance costs and government regulation.
Special Risks Related to Certain Municipal Securities. The Trust may invest in municipal leases and certificates of participation in such leases. Municipal leases and certificates of participation involve special risks not normally associated with general obligations or revenue bonds. Leases and installment purchase or conditional sale contracts (which normally provide for title to the leased asset to pass eventually to the governmental issuer) have evolved as a means for governmental issuers to acquire property and equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of debt. The debt issuance limitations are deemed to be inapplicable because of the inclusion in many leases or contracts of “non-appropriation” clauses that relieve the governmental issuer of any obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless money is appropriated for such purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis. In addition, such leases or contracts may be subject to the temporary abatement of payments in the event the governmental issuer is prevented from maintaining occupancy of the leased premises or utilizing the leased equipment. Although the obligations may be secured by the leased equipment or facilities, the disposition of the property in the event of non-appropriation or foreclosure might prove difficult, time consuming and costly, and may result in a delay in recovering or the failure to fully recover the Trust’s original investment. In the event of non-appropriation, the issuer would be in default and taking ownership of the assets may be a remedy available to the Trust, although the Trust does not anticipate that such a remedy would normally be pursued. To the extent that the Trust invests in unrated municipal leases or participates in such leases, the credit quality and risk of cancellation of such unrated leases will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Certificates of participation, which represent interests in unmanaged pools of municipal leases or installment contracts, involve the same risks as the underlying municipal leases. In addition, the Trust may be dependent upon the municipal authority issuing the certificates of participation to exercise remedies with respect to the underlying securities. Certificates of participation entail a risk of default or bankruptcy not only of the issuer of the underlying lease but also of the municipal agency issuing the certificate of participation.
Asset-Backed Securities Risk. Investing in asset-backed securities (“ABS”) entails various risks, including credit risks, liquidity risks, interest-rate risks, market risks and legal risks. ABS are subject to significant credit risks because of the credit risks inherent in the underlying collateral and because issuers are primarily private entities. The structure of ABS and the terms of the investors’ interest in the collateral can vary widely depending on the type of collateral, the desires of investors and the use of credit enhancements. Although the basic elements of all ABS are similar, individual transactions can differ markedly in both structure and execution. Important determinants of the risk associated with issuing or holding the securities include the process by which principal and interest payments are allocated and distributed to investors, how credit losses affect the issuing vehicle and the return to investors in such ABS, whether collateral represents a fixed set of specific assets or accounts, whether the underlying collateral assets are revolving or closed-end, under what terms (including the maturity of the ABS itself) any remaining balance in the accounts may revert to the issuing entity and the extent to which the entity that is the actual source of the collateral assets is obligated to provide support to the issuing vehicle or to the investors in such ABS. The Trust may invest in ABS that are subordinate in right of payment and rank junior to other securities that are secured by or represent an ownership interest in the same pool of assets. In addition, many of the transactions in which such securities are issued have structural features that divert payments of interest and/or principal to more senior classes when the delinquency or loss experience of the pool exceeds certain levels. As a result, such securities have a higher risk of loss as a result of delinquencies or losses on the underlying assets.
Senior Loan Risk. Senior loans are usually rated below investment-grade. As a result, the risks associated with senior loans are similar to the risks of below investment-grade securities. There is less readily available, reliable information about most senior loans than is the case for many other types of securities. As a result, the Trust is particularly dependent on the analytical abilities of the sub-adviser. No active trading market may exist for certain senior loans, which may impair the ability of the Trust to realize full value in the event of the need to sell a senior loan and which may make it difficult to value senior loans. In the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower, the Trust could experience delays or limitations with respect to its ability to realize the benefits of the collateral securing a senior loan. In purchasing participations, the Trust will be exposed to the credit risk of both the borrower and the institution selling the participation.
Liquidity Risk. The Trust may invest up to 15% of its managed assets in municipal securities that are, at the time of investment, illiquid and certain other securities in which the Trust may invest may be illiquid. Illiquid securities are securities that cannot be disposed of within seven days in the ordinary course of business at approximately the value that the Trust values the securities. Illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable, more liquid securities and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value. The Trust may be subject to significant delays in disposing of illiquid securities. Accordingly, the Trust may be forced to sell these securities at less than fair market value or may not be able to sell them when the sub-adviser believes it is desirable to do so. Illiquid securities also may entail registration expenses and other transaction costs that are higher than those for liquid securities. Restricted securities (i.e., securities subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale) may be illiquid. However, some restricted securities (such as securities issued pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”) and certain commercial paper) may be treated as liquid for these purposes. Inverse floating-rate securities or the residual interest certificates of tender option bond trusts are not considered illiquid securities.
Volatility Risk. The use of financial leverage by the Trust will cause the net asset value, and possibly the market price, of the Trust's common shares to fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates and other economic indicators. In addition, the Trust may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in below investment-grade securities (i.e. "junk bonds"), which may be less liquid and therefore more volatile than investment-grade municipal securities. As a result, the net asset value and market price of the common shares of the Trust will be more volatile than those of a closed-end investment company that is not exposed to leverage or that does not invest in below investment-grade securities.
Inverse Floating-Rate Securities Risk. Under current market conditions, the Trust anticipates utilizing financial leverage through Indebtedness and/or engaging in reverse repurchase agreements. However, the Trust also may utilize financial leverage through investments in inverse floating-rate securities (sometimes referred to as “inverse floaters”). Typically, inverse floating-rate securities represent beneficial interests in a special purpose trust (sometimes called a “tender option bond trust”) formed by a third party sponsor for the purpose of holding municipal bonds. Distributions on inverse floating-rate securities bear an inverse relationship to short-term municipal bond interest rates. In general, income on inverse floating-rate securities will decrease, or in the extreme be eliminated, when interest rates increase and increase when interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floating-rate securities may subject the Trust to the risks of reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of principal. Short-term interest rates are at historic lows and may be more likely to rise in the current market environment.Inverse floating-rate securities may increase or decrease in value at a greater rate than the underlying interest rate, which effectively leverages the Trust’s investment. As a result, the market value of such securities generally will be more volatile than that of fixed-rate securities. Inverse floating-rate securities have varying degrees of liquidity based, among other things, upon the liquidity of the underlying securities deposited in a special purpose trust. The Trust may invest in taxable inverse floating-rate securities, issued by special purpose trusts formed with taxable municipal securities. The market for such inverse floating-rate securities issued by special purpose trusts formed with taxable municipal securities is relatively new and undeveloped. Initially, there may be a limited number of counterparties, which may increase the credit risks, counterparty risk and liquidity risk of investing in taxable inverse floating-rate securities. The leverage attributable to such inverse floating-rate securities may be “called away” on relatively short notice and therefore may be less permanent than more traditional forms of financial leverage. In certain circumstances, to the extent the Trust relies on inverse floating-rate securities to achieve its desired effective leverage ratio the likelihood of an increase in the volatility of net asset value and market price of the common shares may be greater. To the extent the Trust relies on inverse floating-rate securities to achieve its desired effective leverage ratio, the Trust may be required to sell its inverse floating-rate securities at less than favorable prices, or liquidate other Trust portfolio holdings in certain circumstances.
Recent Market Developments. Global and domestic financial markets have experienced periods of unprecedented turmoil. Instability in the credit markets has made it more difficult for a number of issuers to obtain financings or refinancings for their investment or lending activities or operations. There is a risk that such issuers will be unable to successfully complete such financings or refinancings. In particular, because of the conditions in the credit markets, issuers of debt securities may be subject to increased costs for debt, tightening underwriting standards and reduced liquidity for loans they make, securities they purchase and securities they issue. There is also a risk that developments in sectors of the credit markets in which the Trust does not invest may adversely affect the liquidity and the value of securities in sectors of the credit markets in which the Trust does invest, including securities owned by the Trust. The debt and equity capital markets in the United States have been negatively impacted by significant write-offs in the financial services sector relating to sub-prime mortgages and the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated market, among other things. These events, along with the deterioration of the housing market, the failure of major financial institutions and the resulting United States federal government actions led to worsening general economic conditions, which materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial firms in particular. Such market conditions may increase the volatility of the value of securities owned by the Trust, may make it more difficult for the Trust to accurately value its securities or to sell its securities on a timely basis and may adversely affect the ability of the Trust to borrow for investment purposes and increase the cost of such borrowings, which would reduce returns to the holders of common shares. These developments adversely affected the broader economy, and may continue to do so, which in turn may adversely affect the ability of issuers of securities owned by the Trust to make payments of principal and interest when due, lead to lower credit ratings and increased defaults. Such developments could, in turn, reduce the value of securities owned by the Trust and adversely affect the net asset value of the Trust’s common shares. In addition, the prolonged continuation or further deterioration of current market conditions could adversely impact the Trust’s portfolio. Governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments. Also, as a result of the downturn, many state and local governments have experienced significant reductions in revenues and consequently difficulties meeting ongoing expenses. As a result, certain of these state and local governments may have difficulty paying principal or interest on their outstanding debt and may experience ratings downgrades of their debt. In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. In addition to actions taken at the federal level, certain municipalities might seek protection under the bankruptcy laws, thereby affecting the repayment of their outstanding debt. Recently markets have witnessed more stabilized economic activity as expectations for an economic recovery increased. However, risks to a robust resumption of growth persist. A return to unfavorable economic conditions or sustained economic slowdown could adversely impact the Trust’s portfolio. Financial market conditions, as well as various social and political tensions in the United States and around the world, have contributed to increased market volatility and may have long-term effects on the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. The adviser and sub-adviser do not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the U.S. and global economies and securities markets in the Trust’s portfolio. The investment adviser and the sub-adviser intend to monitor developments and seek to manage the Trust’s portfolio in a manner consistent with achieving the Trust’s investment objectives, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in doing so.
Legislation And Regulation Risk. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in July 2010, has resulted in significant revisions to the U.S. financial regulatory framework. The Dodd-Frank Act covers a broad range of topics, including, among many others: a reorganization of federal financial regulators; the creation of a process designed to ensure financial system stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms; the enactment of new rules for derivatives trading; the creation of a consumer financial protection watchdog; the registration and regulation of managers of private funds; the regulation of rating agencies; and the enactment of new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans. The regulation of various types of derivative instruments pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect the Fund or its counterparties. The ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, and regulation that has been enacted thereunder, is not yet certain and issuers of securities in which the Fund invests may also be affected in ways that are currently unknown and unforeseeable.

On December 11, 2015, the SEC published a proposed rule that, if adopted, would change the regulation of the use of derivative instruments and financial commitment transactions by registered investment companies. The SEC sought public comments on numerous aspects of the proposed rule, and as a result the nature of any final regulations is uncertain at this time. Such regulations could limit the implementation of the Fund’s use of derivatives and reverse repurchase agreement transactions and impose additional compliance costs on the Fund, which could have an adverse impact on the Fund. The Adviser cannot predict the effects of these regulations on the Fund’s portfolio. The Adviser intends to monitor developments and seek to manage the Fund’s portfolio in a manner consistent with achieving the Fund’s investment objective, but there can be no assurance that they will be successful in doing so.

According to various reports, certain financial institutions, commencing as early as 2005 and throughout the global financial crisis, routinely made artificially low submissions in the LIBOR rate setting process. A number of financial institutions have entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies, and have been fined significant amounts, in connection with allegations of manipulation of LIBOR. Other proceedings and investigations by regulators and governmental authorities in various jurisdictions are ongoing.. These developments may have adversely affected the interest rates on securities whose interest payments were determined by reference to LIBOR. Any future similar developments could, in turn, reduce the value of such securities owned by the Fund.

At any time after the date of this Prospectus, legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the assets of the Fund or the issuers of such assets. Changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact on the Fund or entities in which the Fund invests. Legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the Fund itself is regulated. There can be no assurance that future legislation, regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on the Fund or will not impair the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Strategic Transactions Risk. The Trust may engage in various portfolio strategies, including derivatives transactions involving interest rate and foreign currency transactions, swaps, options and futures (“strategic transactions”), for hedging and risk management purposes and to enhance total return. The use of strategic transactions to enhance total return may be particularly speculative. Strategic transactions involve risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets, the possible default of the other party to the transaction and illiquidity of the derivative instruments. Furthermore, the Trust’s ability to successfully use strategic transactions depends on the sub-adviser’s ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured. The use of strategic transactions may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the Trust to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Trust can realize on an investment or may cause the Trust to hold a security that it might otherwise sell. Additionally, amounts paid by the Trust as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to strategic transactions are not otherwise available to the Trust for investment purposes.
Synthetic Investments Risk. As an alternative to holding investments directly, the Trust may also obtain investment exposure to credit securities through the use of derivative instruments (including swaps, options, forwards, notional principal contracts or customized derivative or financial instruments) to replicate, modify or replace the economic attributes associated with an investment in securities in which the Trust may invest. The Trust may be exposed to certain additional risks, including counterparty risk, should the sub-adviser use derivatives as a means to synthetically implement the Trust’s investment strategies. If the Trust enters into a derivative instrument whereby it agrees to receive the return of a security or financial instrument or a basket of securities or financial instruments, it will typically contract to receive such returns for a predetermined period of time. During such period, the Trust may not have the ability to increase or decrease its exposure. In addition, customized derivative instruments will likely be highly illiquid, and it is possible that the Trust will not be able to terminate such derivative instruments prior to their expiration date or that the penalties associated with such a termination might impact the Trust’s performance in a material adverse manner. Furthermore, derivative instruments typically contain provisions giving the counterparty the right to terminate the contract upon the occurrence of certain events. Such events may include a decline in the value of the reference securities and material violations of the terms of the contract or the portfolio guidelines as well as other events determined by the counterparty. If a termination were to occur, the Trust’s return could be adversely affected as it would lose the benefit of the indirect exposure to the reference securities and it may incur significant termination expenses.
Counterparty Risk. The Trust will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts purchased by the Trust. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties, the Trust may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Trust may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances.
Securities Lending Risk. The Trust may lend its portfolio securities to banks or dealers which meet the creditworthiness standards established by the Board of Trustees. Securities lending is subject to the risk that loaned securities may not be available to the Trust on a timely basis and the Trust may therefore lose the opportunity to sell the securities at a desirable price. Any loss in the market price of securities loaned by the Trust that occurs during the term of the loan would be borne by the Trust and would adversely affect the Trust’s performance. Also, there may be delays in recovery, or no recovery, of securities loaned or even a loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially while the loan is outstanding.
Investment Funds Risk. Investments in investment funds present certain special considerations and risks not present in making direct investments in securities in which the Trust may invest. Investments in investment funds involve operating expenses and fees that are in addition to the expenses and fees borne by the Trust. Such expenses and fees attributable to the Trust’s investments in investment funds are borne indirectly by common shareholders. Accordingly, investment in such entities involves expense and fee layering. To the extent management fees of investment trusts are based on total gross assets, it may create an incentive for such entities’ managers to employ financial leverage, thereby adding additional expense and increasing volatility and risk. A performance-based fee arrangement may create incentives for an adviser or manager to take greater investment risks in the hope of earning a higher profit participation. Investments in investment funds frequently expose the Trust to an additional layer of financial leverage.
Market Discount Risk. Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value, which is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the Trust’s net asset value could decrease as a result of its investment activities. Although the value of the Trust’s net assets is generally considered by market participants in determining whether to purchase or sell common shares, whether investors will realize gains or losses upon the sale of common shares will depend entirely upon whether the market price of common shares at the time of sale is above or below the investor’s purchase price for common shares. Because the market price of common shares will be determined by factors such as net asset value, dividend and distribution levels (which are dependent, in part, on expenses), supply of and demand for common shares, stability of dividends or distributions, trading volume of common shares, general market and economic conditions and other factors beyond the control of the Trust, the Trust cannot predict whether common shares will trade at, below or above net asset value or at, below or above the initial public offering price. This risk may be greater for investors expecting to sell their common shares soon after the completion of the public offering, as the net asset value of the common shares will be reduced immediately following the offering as a result of the payment of certain offering costs. Common shares of the Trust are designed primarily for long-term investors; investors in common shares should not view the Trust as a vehicle for trading purposes.
Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Trust’s annual portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year. Portfolio turnover rate is not considered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions for the Trust. A higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the Trust. High portfolio turnover may result in an increased realization of net short-term capital gains by the Trust which, when distributed to common shareholders, will be taxable as ordinary income. Additionally, in a declining market, portfolio turnover may create realized capital losses. See “Taxation” in the Trust’s prospectus.
Market Disruption and Geopolitical Risk. Instability in the Middle East and North Africa terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe and around the world have contributed to increased market volatility, may have long-term effects on the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. The adviser and sub-adviser do not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the U.S. and global economies and securities markets.
The Trust’s common share price will fluctuate and, at the time of sale, common shares may be worth more or less than the original investment or the Trust’s then-current net asset value. The Trust cannot predict whether its common shares will trade at, above or below net asset value.
