Arbitration & Mediation Services

Corporate Business Lawyers

Trial Lawyers













Arbitration & Mediation Services: Arbitration is an alternative means of setttling a dispute by impartial persons without proceeding to a court trial. It is sometimes preferred as a means of settling a matter in ordert to avoid the expense, delay, and acrimony of litigation. There is no discovery and there are simplified rules of evidence in arbitration. The arbitrator or arbitrators are selected directly by the parties or are chosen in accordance with the terms of a contract in which the parties have agreed to use a court-ordered arbitrator or an arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association. If there is no contract, usually each party chooses an arbitrator and the two arbitrators select a third to comprise the panel. When parties submit to arbitration, they agree to be bound by and comply with the arbitrators' decision. The arbitrators' decision is given after an informal proceeding where each side presents evidence and witnesses. Arbitration hearings usually last only a few hours and the opinions are not public record. Arbitration has long been used in labor, construction, and securities regulation, but is now gaining popularity in other business disputes.

Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Corporate Business Lawyers: A corporate lawyer is also known as In-House Counsel, Staff Attorney, Deputy General Counsel, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer. Their primary objective is to serve the interests of the corporation, not the owners of the business or the officers who run it. In addition to legal counsel, they may also be called upon to provide business advice. They may practice other areas of law concerning mergers and acquisitions, trademarks, tax law bankruptcy, employment, securities, real estate or international commercial law.

George C. Freeman, III, is a founding member of the firm and serves as the firm's managing partner. His practice focuses mainly on securities litigation and enforcement. He primarily represents financial advisors and broker-dealers, together with their respective officers, directors, and employees, in customer disputes and in SEC and FINRA investigations. He also represents underwriters, issuers, and trustees in securities class action cases. Outside the field of securities, George concentrates in complex commercial litigation. George has been recognized by Chambers USA in the field of Securities Litigation, and by Best Lawyers in the fields of Bet-the-Company Litigation, Commercial Litigation, and Securities Litigation. According to Chambers USA, George’s clients and peers have referred to him as “one of the best” securities litigation attorneys around, and have praised his “academic, scholarly knowledge of securities law.”
       
Notable Representations Led team representing broker-dealer in FINRA arbitrations, and in state and federal courts cases, nationwide arising from six high-yield bond funds that sustained massive losses during the 2007-2008 market meltdown. The firm has handled over 400 cases, and taken over 25 arbitration claims to final award, with most resulting in take-nothing decisions or awards representing only a small fraction of the amounts sought by the claimants. Represented senior executive of national broker-dealer in regulatory proceedings and civil litigation arising out of a multi-billion dollar ponzi scheme. Represented broker-dealer in federal trial and appellate courts nationwide in successfully obtaining injunctions barring investors from pursuing their claims before FINRA. Every federal court rejected the investors’ arguments and required investors to litigate rather than arbitrate their claims. Defended senior executive of a publicly-traded company, who, with his company, was a target of an SEC investigation into the company’s restatement of its annual financials. Represented multiple broker-dealers in numerous arbitrations and regulatory proceedings in the aftermath of the dotcom crash. Handled multiple cases, over a period of five years, relating to accusations of inaccurate stock assessments produced in research analyst’s reports. 
Professional and Civic ActivitiesGeorge has long been a member of the American, Louisiana, and New Orleans Bar Associations, as well as the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the American Law Institute. He has served as an arbitrator for the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange, and the American Arbitration Association. He also has taught jurisprudence, constitutional theory, and securities litigation and arbitration for over twenty-five years as a member of the adjunct faculty at Tulane University Law School, where he is a full Professor and a recipient of the Monte M. Lehman Distinguished Teaching Award. George is also active in community affairs. He has served on the Board of Directors of Trinity Episcopal School, of the Langston Hughes Academy Charter School, of FirstLine Schools, and on the Tulane Cancer Center Community Advisory Board.
