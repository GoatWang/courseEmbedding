Cancer Research
VAL-083 is a "first-in-class",small-molecule chemotherapeutic. In more than 40 Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute ("NCI"), VAL-083 demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating a number of cancers, including lung, brain, cervical, ovarian tumors and leukemia. VAL-083 is approved in China for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and lung cancer.
DelMar's business model is to leverage historical data by combining it with modern biological understandings of cancer and drug mechanism in order to address unmet medical needs.  This strategy also allows us to generate new intellectual property which is protected through DelMar's patent filings.


Reduced Risk: Historical evidence of clinical activity
Reduced Cost: Leverage prior investments
Reduced Time: Speed up development process with substantial prior data

DelMar is currently studying VAL-083 in a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial for patients with refractory glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in accordance with the protocol that has been filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   VAL-083 has received orphan drug designation in Europe and the U.S. for the treatment of gliomas.
Our research to date suggests that the unique anti-cancer mechanism of VAL-083 is distinct from platinum-based chemotherapy and much less susceptible to drug resistance mediated by p53.
The p53 gene plays a central role in the protection of the human body from cancer and is responsible for initiating the process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which directs a cell to commit suicide if it becomes damaged or cancerous.  The p53 pathway is also integral to the activity of many chemotherapy drugs.  p53 is frequently mutated in NSCLC and p53 mutations are highly correlated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor patient outcomes in NSCLC.
DelMar believes that these data support the potential of VAL-083 to address significant unmet medical needs in the modern treatment of a range of orphan and major cancer indications.

Glioblastoma multiforme ("GBM")

GBM is the most common and lethal form of brain cancer. 
15,000 new cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.1 
Median survival in newly diagnosed patients with best available treatments is 14.6 months.
Standard treatment following diagnosis includes surgical resection to remove as much of the tumor as possible (debulking), followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy with TemodarÂŹĂ (temozolomide, "TMZ"). 
Nearly all patients diagnosed with GBM will relapse following first-line treatment, with a 1-year survival rate of approximately 25% following failure of front-line therapy, with average 5-year survival rate less than 3%.2

VAL-083
Based on historical data and our own research, we believe that VAL-083 has the potential to offer physicians and patients a new paradigm in the treatment of GBM.
O6-DNA methylguanine methyl-transferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that causes resistance to temozolomide, the current standard of care in the treatment of GBM.  High expression of the MGMT enzyme is strongly correlated with poor patient outcomes.3

We have demonstrated that VAL-083's cytotoxic mechanism has more potent activity against brain tumor cells in comparison to TMZ and can overcome resistance associated with MGMT, suggesting that VAL-083 has the potential to surpass TMZ as the current standard-of-care in the treatment of GBM.4

DelMar's research is backed by historical clinical trials with VAL-083 that were conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute ("NCI") demonstrating activity against GBM that is comparable, or superior, to TMZ and other chemotherapies approved for the treatment of GBM.

DelMar is conducting clinical trials with VAL-083 as a potential treatment for GBM patients that have failed or whose tumors express biological features, such as a high expression of MGMT, that make them unlikely to respond to currently available therapies.

DelMar Pharmaceuticals Receives Approval from China's Human Genetic Resources Administration to Initiate Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Newly Diagnosed GBM


 Download as PDF

July 24, 2017

Biomarker-driven clinical trial will explore safety and efficacy of chemoradiation with VAL-083 as an alternative to standard-of-care temozolomide in MGMT-unmethylated GBM

VANCOUVER, British Columbia and MENLO PARK, Calif., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DelMar Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: DMPI) ("DelMar" and "the Company"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new cancer therapies, today announced that the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC), has approved the Company's application to initiate a Phase 2 safety and efficacy study of its lead product candidate VAL-083 in newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). DelMar was required to obtain HGRAC approval because the trial involves analysis of patient's MGMT status as a biomarker for patient selection and enrollment.  
"Our clinical trials to date have been focused on recurrent GBM for patients whose tumors have recurred following currently approved therapies. Obtaining HGRAC approval represents a significant step toward maximizing the potential benefit of VAL-083 in newly diagnosed GBM for patients whose tumors exhibit features, such as high expression of MGMT, which render them resistant to the current standard-of-care chemotherapy," said Jeffrey Bacha, Chief Executive Officer of DelMar Pharmaceuticals. "Success of VAL-083 as a front-line treatment would be a major turning point for the brain tumor community and this area of science." 
Up to 30 newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors exhibit high-expression of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) will be treated with VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy to examine the safety and efficacy of VAL-083 in this population. MGMT methylation status will be used as a biomarker for patient selection and only patients whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will be enrolled.  
Results of the trial will be used to guide design of global randomized trials, which if successful, would position VAL-083 as a potential replacement for the current standard-of-care (chemoradiation with temozolomide) for the approximately 2/3 of newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors feature MGMT-unmethylated GBM. 
GBM patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors exhibit a high expression of the MGMT enzyme, which is directly correlated to resistance to temozolomide, the current front-line chemotherapy used in the treatment of GBM. MGMT-unmethylated patients have particularly poor patient outcomes and significantly reduced survival compared to MGMT-methylated patients.  
DelMar has demonstrated that VAL-083's anti-cancer activity is independent of MGMT expression against multiple GBM cell lines in vitro. VAL-083's clinical activity against GBM has been established by DelMar's recent Phase 2 clinical trials in refractory GBM and historical trials conducted by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI). Results of prior NCI-sponsored trials of VAL-083 combined with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM suggest a potential superior benefit of chemoradiation with VAL-083 versus radiotherapy alone (+8.3 months) in comparison to similar studies involving temozolomide or nitrosoureas (+1.2 – 2.5 months).
Mr. Bacha continued, "GBM has been largely left behind in the recent advancements made in the fight against cancer and new therapies improving median survival have been lacking. We strongly believe that VAL-083 represents a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of GBM, particularly for the 2/3 of newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors exhibit high expression of MGMT."
The trial is expected to open for enrollment in the coming weeks at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYUCC) in Guangzhou, China under the direction of Professor Zhong-ping Chen, M.D., Ph.D., who serves as chair of the Department of NeuroSurgery/Neuro-Oncology at SYUCC. Prof. Chen has authored dozens of publications and been involved in numerous international brain tumor trials. He also currently serves as president of the Chinese Society for NeuroOncology and as editor-in-chief of the Chinese Journal of NeuroOncology. Kun Tuo, a subsidiary of QuintilesIMS, has been retained to monitor and oversee the conduct of the trial. Funding support for the trial will be provided by Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma), under the terms of DelMar's collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma. Further details of the trial can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier Number: NCT03050736)
About VAL-083
VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol) is a "first-in-class", DNA-targeting agent that introduces interstrand DNA cross-links at the N7-position of guanine leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. VAL-083 has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including GBM in historical clinical trials sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute.
VAL-083 has been granted an orphan drug designation by the U.S. FDA Office of Orphan Products for the treatment of glioma, medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer, and in Europe for the treatment of malignant gliomas.
DelMar has demonstrated that VAL-083's anti-tumor activity against GBM is unaffected by the expression of MGMT in vitro. Further details regarding these studies can be found at http://www.delmarpharma.com/scientific-publications.html.
The Company's recent outcomes in Phase 1-2 clinical trials suggest that VAL-083 may offer a clinically meaningful survival benefit for patients with recurrent GBM following treatment with both TMZ and bevacizumab. A well-tolerated dosing regimen of 40mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day cycle was selected for study in subsequent GBM clinical trials.
Based on these results, DelMar has embarked on human clinical trials for VAL-083 across multiple lines of GBM therapy. These trials include, i) an ongoing single-arm, biomarker driven, Phase 2 study to determine if VAL-083 treatment of MGMT-unmethylated adult GBM patients at first recurrence/progression, prior to bevacizumab, improves overall survival, compared to historical control with lomustine (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02717962); ii) a pivotal, controlled Phase 3 study in temozolomide-Avastin Recurrent GBM ("STAR-3") to evaluate overall survival versus salvage chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03149575); and iii) a single arm, biomarker driven, Phase 2 study to confirm the tolerability and efficacy of VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated GBM patients whose tumors are known to express high MGMT levels (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03050736). DelMar believes that the results of these studies may support a new treatment paradigm in chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of GBM.
About Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. GBM has an incidence of two to three per 100,000 adults per year, and accounts for 52 percent of all primary brain tumors. In the US alone, approximately 18,000 people are diagnosed with GBM every year. GBM accounts for 13,000 cancer deaths in the US annually. Current standard of care includes surgery, radiation and treatment with temozolomide (TMZ), however nearly all tumors recur and the prognosis for recurrent GBM is dismal. Most GBM tumors have unmethylated promoter status for O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT); a validated biomarker for TMZ-resistance. Second-line treatment with anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab has not improved overall survival (OS) and 5-year survival is less than 3%.
About DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing cancer therapies in indications where patients are failing or have become intolerable to modern targeted or biologic treatments. The Company's pipeline is based around VAL-083, a "first-in-class," small-molecule chemotherapeutic with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ovarian and other solid tumors (e.g. NSCLC, bladder cancer, head & neck) in U.S. clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). VAL-083 has been granted an orphan drug designation by the U.S. FDA Office of Orphan Products for the treatment of glioma, medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer, and in Europe for the treatment of malignant glioma.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") is a clinical stage drug
development company with a focus on the treatment of cancer. We are conducting
clinical trials in the United States with our product candidate, VAL-083, as a
potential new treatment for glioblastoma multiforme ("GBM"), the most common and
aggressive form of brain cancer. Our mission is to benefit patients and create
shareholder value by rapidly developing and commercializing anti-cancer
therapies in orphan cancer indications where patients have failed, or are
unlikely to respond to, modern therapy. We have presented interim data from our
clinical trial at peer reviewed scientific meetings demonstrating that VAL-083
can shrink or halt the growth of tumors in some brain cancer patients who have
failed other approved treatments. Currently, there is no approved therapy for
these patients.  ... More ...

DelMar Pharmaceuticals Receives Approval from China's Human Genetic Resources Administration to Initiate Phase 2 Clinical Trial in Newly Diagnosed GBM

If you are affiliated with this page and would like it removed please contact pressreleases@franklyinc.comSOURCE  DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Biomarker-driven clinical trial will explore safety and efficacy of chemoradiation with VAL-083 as an alternative to standard-of-care temozolomide in MGMT-unmethylated GBMVANCOUVER, British Columbia and MENLO PARK, Calif., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- DelMar Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: DMPI) ("DelMar" and "the Company"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new cancer therapies, today announced that the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC), has approved the Company's application to initiate a Phase 2 safety and efficacy study of its lead product candidate VAL-083 in newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). DelMar was required to obtain HGRAC approval because the trial involves analysis of patient's MGMT status as a biomarker for patient selection and enrollment.  "Our clinical trials to date have been focused on recurrent GBM for patients whose tumors have recurred following currently approved therapies. Obtaining HGRAC approval represents a significant step toward maximizing the potential benefit of VAL-083 in newly diagnosed GBM for patients whose tumors exhibit features, such as high expression of MGMT, which render them resistant to the current standard-of-care chemotherapy," said Jeffrey Bacha, Chief Executive Officer of DelMar Pharmaceuticals. "Success of VAL-083 as a front-line treatment would be a major turning point for the brain tumor community and this area of science." Up to 30 newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors exhibit high-expression of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) will be treated with VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy to examine the safety and efficacy of VAL-083 in this population. MGMT methylation status will be used as a biomarker for patient selection and only patients whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated will be enrolled.  Results of the trial will be used to guide design of global randomized trials, which if successful, would position VAL-083 as a potential replacement for the current standard-of-care (chemoradiation with temozolomide) for the approximately 2/3 of newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors feature MGMT-unmethylated GBM. GBM patients with MGMT-unmethylated tumors exhibit a high expression of the MGMT enzyme, which is directly correlated to resistance to temozolomide, the current front-line chemotherapy used in the treatment of GBM. MGMT-unmethylated patients have particularly poor patient outcomes and significantly reduced survival compared to MGMT-methylated patients.  DelMar has demonstrated that VAL-083's anti-cancer activity is independent of MGMT expression against multiple GBM cell lines in vitro. VAL-083's clinical activity against GBM has been established by DelMar's recent Phase 2 clinical trials in refractory GBM and historical trials conducted by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI). Results of prior NCI-sponsored trials of VAL-083 combined with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed GBM suggest a potential superior benefit of chemoradiation with VAL-083 versus radiotherapy alone (+8.3 months) in comparison to similar studies involving temozolomide or nitrosoureas (+1.2 – 2.5 months).Mr. Bacha continued, "GBM has been largely left behind in the recent advancements made in the fight against cancer and new therapies improving median survival have been lacking. We strongly believe that VAL-083 represents a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of GBM, particularly for the 2/3 of newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors exhibit high expression of MGMT."The trial is expected to open for enrollment in the coming weeks at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYUCC) in Guangzhou, China under the direction of Professor Zhong-ping Chen, M.D., Ph.D., who serves as chair of the Department of NeuroSurgery/Neuro-Oncology at SYUCC. Prof. Chen has authored dozens of publications and been involved in numerous international brain tumor trials. He also currently serves as president of the Chinese Society for NeuroOncology and as editor-in-chief of the Chinese Journal of NeuroOncology. Kun Tuo, a subsidiary of QuintilesIMS, has been retained to monitor and oversee the conduct of the trial. Funding support for the trial will be provided by Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma), under the terms of DelMar's collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma. Further details of the trial can be found at clinicaltrials.gov (Identifier Number: NCT03050736)About VAL-083VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol) is a "first-in-class", DNA-targeting agent that introduces interstrand DNA cross-links at the N7-position of guanine leading to DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. VAL-083 has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including GBM in historical clinical trials sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute.VAL-083 has been granted an orphan drug designation by the U.S. FDA Office of Orphan Products for the treatment of glioma, medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer, and in Europe for the treatment of malignant gliomas.DelMar has demonstrated that VAL-083's anti-tumor activity against GBM is unaffected by the expression of MGMT in vitro. Further details regarding these studies can be found at http://www.delmarpharma.com/scientific-publications.html.The Company's recent outcomes in Phase 1-2 clinical trials suggest that VAL-083 may offer a clinically meaningful survival benefit for patients with recurrent GBM following treatment with both TMZ and bevacizumab. A well-tolerated dosing regimen of 40mg/m2/day on days 1, 2, and 3 of a 21-day cycle was selected for study in subsequent GBM clinical trials.Based on these results, DelMar has embarked on human clinical trials for VAL-083 across multiple lines of GBM therapy. These trials include, i) an ongoing single-arm, biomarker driven, Phase 2 study to determine if VAL-083 treatment of MGMT-unmethylated adult GBM patients at first recurrence/progression, prior to bevacizumab, improves overall survival, compared to historical control with lomustine (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02717962); ii) a pivotal, controlled Phase 3 study in temozolomide-Avastin Recurrent GBM ("STAR-3") to evaluate overall survival versus salvage chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03149575); and iii) a single arm, biomarker driven, Phase 2 study to confirm the tolerability and efficacy of VAL-083 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed MGMT-unmethylated GBM patients whose tumors are known to express high MGMT levels (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT03050736). DelMar believes that the results of these studies may support a new treatment paradigm in chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of GBM.About Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM)Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain cancer. GBM has an incidence of two to three per 100,000 adults per year, and accounts for 52 percent of all primary brain tumors. In the US alone, approximately 18,000 people are diagnosed with GBM every year. GBM accounts for 13,000 cancer deaths in the US annually. Current standard of care includes surgery, radiation and treatment with temozolomide (TMZ), however nearly all tumors recur and the prognosis for recurrent GBM is dismal. Most GBM tumors have unmethylated promoter status for O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT); a validated biomarker for TMZ-resistance. Second-line treatment with anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab has not improved overall survival (OS) and 5-year survival is less than 3%.About DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing cancer therapies in indications where patients are failing or have become intolerable to modern targeted or biologic treatments. The Company's pipeline is based around VAL-083, a "first-in-class," small-molecule chemotherapeutic with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), ovarian and other solid tumors (e.g. NSCLC, bladder cancer, head & neck) in U.S. clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). VAL-083 has been granted an orphan drug designation by the U.S. FDA Office of Orphan Products for the treatment of glioma, medulloblastoma and ovarian cancer, and in Europe for the treatment of malignant glioma.
