We expect to receive approximately $378.3 million of net proceeds (assuming
the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) from
the sale of the common stock offered by us after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling
stockholders (including pursuant to any exercise by the underwriters of their
option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from the selling
stockholders).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with cash on
hand and borrowings under our new revolving credit facility, to repay and retire
the Vantage I revolving credit facility, the Vantage I second lien term loan,
the Vantage II revolving credit facility and the Vantage II second lien term
loan. In connection with the repayment of the term loans and credit facility
borrowings, we expect to record a $14.6 million earnings charge for the
extinguishment of debt; however, this charge is not reflected in our pro forma
financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The following table illustrates our anticipated use of the proceeds of this
offering:

Sources of Funds (in millions)                Uses of Funds (in millions)                    

Gross proceeds from this offering    $ 400.4  Repayment of Vantage I revolving

Borrowings under the new revolving            Repayment of Vantage I second lien

                                              Repayment of Vantage II revolving                              
                                              credit facility                          20.0

                                              term loan                               100.0  
                                              Underwriting discounts, fees and              
                                              expenses                                 22.0  

Total                                $ 462.1  Total                                 $ 462.1  

As of September 10, 2014, we had $111.0 million of outstanding borrowings
under the Vantage I revolving credit facility. The Vantage I revolving credit
facility matures July 19, 2015 and bears interest at a variable rate, which was
2.38% per annum at June 30, 2014. As of September 10, 2014, we had $20.0 million
of outstanding borrowings under the Vantage II revolving credit facility. The
Vantage II revolving credit facility matures November 8, 2016 and bears interest
at a variable rate, which was 2.38% per annum at June 30, 2014.

The $200 million Vantage I second lien term loan matures December 20, 2018
and bears interest at a variable rate, which was 8.5% per annum at June 30,
2014. On May 8, 2014, we entered into the $100 million Vantage II second lien
term loan, which matures on May 8, 2017 and bears interest at a variable rate,
which was 8.5% per annum at June 30, 2014.

The outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and term
loans were incurred to fund our development program. We may at any time reborrow
amounts repaid under our new revolving credit facility, and we expect to do so
to fund our development program.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$25.50 per share would cause the net proceeds from this offering, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses, received by us to increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately
$15.0 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. If the proceeds increase for
any reason, we would use the additional net proceeds to reduce the amount we
borrow under our new revolving credit facility or for general corporate
purposes, including to fund a portion of our development program. If the
proceeds decrease for any reason, then we would increase by a corresponding 
amount the amount of borrowings under our new revolving credit facility. 

An affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is a lender under the
Vantage I second lien term loan and will receive more than 5% of the net
proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, this offering is being made in
compliance with Rule 5121 of the FINRA. Additionally, affiliates of certain of
the underwriters are lenders under the Vantage I revolving credit facility, the
Vantage II revolving credit facility or the Vantage I second lien term loan and
may receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering.


The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete
with other companies in our industry that have greater resources than we do.
Many of these companies not only explore for and produce natural gas, but also
carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a
regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more
for productive natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define,
evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than
our financial or human resources permit and may be able to expend greater
resources to attract and maintain industry personnel. In addition, these
companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during
periods of low natural gas market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to
absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws
and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our
competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to
discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate
and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly
competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human
resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in
bidding for exploratory prospects and producing natural gas properties.


Company Description
We are a growth-oriented, independent oil and natural gas company engaged in
the acquisition, development, exploitation and exploration of oil and natural
gas properties in the United States, with a focus on the Marcellus Shale, where
we hold a concentrated acreage position in what we believe to be


 the core of the
play in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, we have a sizeable position
in what we believe to be the core of the Barnett Shale. We believe these areas
are among the most prolific unconventional resource plays in North America, and
are generally characterized by high well recoveries relative to drilling and
completion costs, predictable production profiles, significant hydrocarbons in
place and favorable operating environments.

Our management team has a proven track record of implementing technically
driven growth strategies to target best-in-class returns in some of the most
prominent unconventional plays across the United States. Roger Biemans, our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Tyree, our President and Chief
Financial Officer, founded our company with investments from affiliates of
Quantum Energy Partners, Riverstone Holdings LLC and Lime Rock Partners. We made
our initial entry into the Barnett Shale in 2007 and the Marcellus Shale in
2010. Since then, we have been committed to a strategy of disciplined growth
through acquisitions and development drilling in the highest quality areas of
these plays.

We utilize advanced well completion strategies and technologies, including
pad drilling and downhole rotary steering, to optimize well economics and
operational efficiencies. We believe that our horizontal drilling and completion
expertise, coupled with the favorable geologic characteristics of our Marcellus
and Barnett Shale acreage, positions us for continued strong results and growth.
We have grown our net daily production from 18.1 MMcfe/d for the year ended
December 31, 2011, to 63.3 MMcfe/d for the year ended December 31, 2013,
representing a compounded annual growth rate of 86.8%. Our estimated average net
daily wellhead production for the month of August 2014 was 150.4 MMcfe/d.

We have assembled a largely contiguous acreage position of 57,545 net acres
in what we believe to be the core of the Marcellus Shale in Greene County,
Pennsylvania. In addition, our Barnett Shale assets consist of approximately
38,499 net acres, 23,398 of which are located in what we believe to be the core
of the basin in Denton, Wise and Tarrant Counties in Texas. As of August 31,
2014, we had two rigs operating in the Marcellus Shale and two rigs operating in
the Barnett Shale and expect to operate approximately that same number of rigs
for the remainder of 2014. As of April 30, 2014, we had 1,074 identified
drilling locations, including 423 in the Marcellus Shale, 312 in the Upper
Devonian Shale and 339 in the Barnett Shale.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
