                Principal Global Investors: Investment Manager Highlight (PFG)            


    By J. William Carpenter | March 18, 2016 — 8:38 AM EDT    






Share
























































Principal Global Investors is the global asset management division of the American financial services giant Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: PFG). Principal Global Investors operates in more than 70 countries, offering institutional investors a full range of tailored investment solutions across all major asset classes. The firm employs a multi-boutique investment management model in which more than a dozen highly specialized subsidiary and affiliate investment managers provide customized investment strategies while Principal Global Investors coordinates business operations and shared services. The firm also manages retail funds as a subadvisor for Principal Funds, a separate Principal Financial Group subsidiary.
As of Dec. 31, 2015, Principal Global Investors has more than $360 billion in total assets under management (AUM) across its boutique investment operations. More than 44% of AUM are allocated to fixed-income investments, followed by equities at 38% and investments in private real estate at 13.5% of assets. The remaining 4% of AUM, about $14.8 billion, are allocated to other alternative investments and assets.
Investment Approach
Principal Global Investors and its subsidiary and affiliate boutiques operate on the notion that special expertise and focused effort are essential to delivering tailored investment strategies that evolve with the client's needs over time. To this end, each boutique specializes in a narrow range of investment strategies, implementing a unique investment process suited to the long-term success of those strategies. Each Principal Global Investors boutique also carries out independent research activities rather than relying on a centralized research operation. Research independence, the company believes, is essential to generating impactful research results and new investment insights.
Although each boutique has substantial decision-making autonomy, dedication to disciplined risk management, rigorous research and superior client service are all foundational principles shared across the organization. Investment teams also share a centralized information system, enabling local research teams across the globe to efficiently transmit new research and investment insight across the organization, further leveraging the scale and diversity of Principal Global Investors and its parent corporation.
Product Overview
Principal Global Investors delivers access to world-class investment teams across a wide spectrum of asset classes, investment styles and geographies. Alongside equity, fixed-income and multi-asset strategies, offerings include Islamic investment strategies, currency strategies, emerging market strategies and a variety of options in real estate investments. Boutique investment strategies are available to institutional investors including pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, charitable foundations and central banks.
Principal Global Investors and its boutique investment teams also act as mutual fund subadvisors for many funds distributed by Principal Funds, an independent corporate cousin. Principal Global Investors manages strategies covering a variety of asset classes, including equities, fixed-income investments, real estate investments and asset allocation strategies. Principal Funds primarily distributes products through licensed financial advisors.
Executive Leadership
James P. McCaughan serves as chief executive officer (CEO) of Principal Global Investors and president of global asset management at Principal Financial Group. He is responsible for all asset management activities across the parent company's worldwide operations, including strategic business development activities. McCaughan joined Principal Global Investors in 2002 and has served as CEO ever since. In previous positions, he served as CEO of Credit Suisse Asset Management's Americas division and as president and chief operating officer (COO) of Oppenheimer Capital. McCaughan completed a degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
Barbara A. McKenzie is senior executive director and COO of boutique operations at Principal Global Investors. She is responsible for oversight of the firm's global business, information technology and compliance operations, and she also oversees three subsidiary boutique operations. McKenzie joined the company in 1984. She completed a bachelor's degree in business administration and finance at the University of Iowa, and then completed an MBA degree in real estate and finance at Indiana University.

                        plan or investment advice from Principal® but may be used as general guidelines
                        to help you make retirement planning or other personal financial decisions. Responsibility for these
                        decisions is assumed by you, not Principal. Individual results will vary.

Your Retirement Wellness Score



                Your Retirement Wellness Score indicates the percentage of your pre-retirement income that is estimated to be
                              available at the specified retirement age (based on your personalized inputs and current assumptions). Studies
                              suggest replacing at least 70-85% of your income in retirement.                *
              

                The score compares what you are estimated to have in monthly income at retirement against your estimated monthly
                                pre-retirement income. For example, based on your inputs you may have $1,000 per month when you retire, but your
                                monthly pre-retirement income is $2,000. Your Retirement Wellness Score would be 50.              

                This score, and what you will have, are merely estimates based on information provided by you and several
                              financial assumptions, including a 4.5% withdrawal rate. This information may be valued as of different dates.
                              This is not a guarantee of future income.              

                Your Retirement Wellness Score always assumes you are replacing 100% of your pre-retirement income.
                              So, it will not change if you make changes that impact your desired income in retirement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
