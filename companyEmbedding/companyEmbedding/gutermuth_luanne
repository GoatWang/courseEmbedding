Luanne S. Gutermuth, Vice President HR, Washington Gas





lgutermuth@washgas.com
Industry Experience:  Utilities/Energy, Healthcare, Federal Government procurement
Functional Experience: Currently I am the Vice President, Human Resources & Organization Development for Washington Gas, a $1.2B gas distribution company, where I have responsibility for employee and labor relations, compensation and benefits, recruiting, and employee training and development.  I am also responsible for establishing a workforce strategy and leadership programs that support the company’s overall business objectives.  
Other leadership roles I have held at Washington Gas include Division Head, Consumer Services, Director, Business Process Improvement, Director, Organization Development and Director, Business Planning.  While at ManorCare Health Services, I was the Director of Marketing and Strategy for the company’s Alzheimer’s Services business line.
Key Business Transactional Experience:  At Washington Gas, I led a cross functional effort to evaluate business process outsourcing (BPO) across several functional areas (HR, ITS, Customer Service, Supply Chain).  Subsequently, I led the negotiations with the service provider for a $350M, 10-year contract and then helped to set up the governance organization that oversees the arrangement.  While a Contract Negotiator at the Department of Navy, I led the negotiations for several multi-million dollar procurements.
In my current role as VP, HROD at Washington Gas, I have led the development of a labor relations strategy and overseen negotiations with each of the company’s five labor unions.  
What is the most important skill you bring to a corporate board? Broad perspective and extensive experience in both developing and implementing strategy across a range of functions and business issues.
