About
The Author

David Lee is a highly respected
influential leader who serves with excellence and integrity. Throughout
his nearly 30 years of ministry, David Lee has effectively led high
performing teams in both the religious as well as the secular
communities. Serving as a licensed Ordained Elder under the pastorate
of Bishop T.D. Jakes for nearly 30 years and working under the umbrella
of T.D. Jakes Ministries for nearly a decade, he led the Sunday school
department as the Superintendent until the ministry relocated to its
current location in Dallas Texas. The first ministry class that led to
the licensing of the first set of ministers ordained at the
Potter’s House of Dallas Inc. was taught by David Lee.
Employed by T.D. Jakes Ministries Sales and Marketing Department, David
Lee led more than 500 people who worked with the sale and distribution
of products globally. There he demonstrated his business acumen as the
National Sales Manager where he managed the sale and marketing of a
multi-million dollar inventory at more than 9 major record-breaking
conferences including Woman Thou Art Loosed, Man Power and the Pastors
and Leaders Conferences as well as all of Bishop Jakes smaller personal
engagements.
David Lee is a touchable, practical, hands-on, process driven leader
who loves God and all kinds of people. Together, he along with his wife
Renee Richardson have committed themselves to philanthropy on the level
they are on. Balanced giving to local charities and humanitarian
organizations including feeding 9 children located in Guatemala and
subsidizing the incomes of a pastors and those in need, they put their
money to work for the Kingdom of God in practical meaningful ways that
have tangible results.
Appearing in conferences local
and abroad, David Lee has preached
and led leadership retreats, revivals, trainings and conferences in the
US, Canada, Bermuda and Africa. Through his weekly radio talk show
“The David Lee Show”, he quickly became known for his
understanding of leadership and his creative ability to gender new
insights in those who lead people. Currently he travels extensively
training and developing corporate leaders on building high performing
teams, how to hold deep impacting accountability discussions and how to
change undesirable behaviors through use of effective coaching
conversations and well written Action Plans.
In the pulpit, David Lee is the
first minister to have ever preached
a tag-team sermon with T.D. Jakes at the Potter’s House of Dallas
Inc. Celebrating nearly 30 years in ministry by preaching and teaching
the word of God, he aspires to simple yet powerful biblical principles
that make him an immerging voice of accountability, inspiration, and
influence among today’s spiritual leaders.
He is the proud father of two
adult aged children and two pre-teens.
He and his loving wife Renee are also the proud grandparents of one
loveable granddaughter. He credits the Holy Spirit along with his two
previous pastors Dr. Lincoln Williams Sr. and Bishop T.D. Jakes Sr. for
his Biblical prowess and spiritual clarity. His most recent book Sunday
Morning Stickup what your pastor doesn’t want you to know about
tithes is unapologetically controversial and undeniably enlightening.







What
Others Are Saying
Frank Chase J

I
finished the book and all I can say is that
David Lee stumbled onto a revelation of the tithe that has been hidden
since the sixth century. The author takes a theological position that
Christ became the last final perfect tithe for us on the cross.

I just finished reading
David Lee's book, Sunday Morning Stickup.
All I can say is, I've waited years to read a book that presents what's
contained in this book. I believe David Lee is a christian young man
who clearly demonstrates his love for God throughout this book and he
is anointed beyond belief.

What is the screening process that Service Professionals go through in order to become members of the HomeAdvisor network?





Verify Trade License
            HomeAdvisor checks to see if the business carries the appropriate state-level license. 
Verify Insurance
            As a part of our screening process, we encourage professionals to carry general liability insurance. We require coverage for hundreds of services. 
Verification of State Business Filings
            For business types that require a Secretary of State filing, we confirm that the business is in good standing in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search
            HomeAdvisor uses 3rd party data sources to conduct a criminal search for any relevant criminal activity associated with the owner/principal of the business.
Sex Offender Search
            We confirm that the owner/principal is not listed on the official state Sex Offender web site in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located. 
Bankruptcy Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the history of the principal/owner of the business for bankruptcy filings by or against them.
Legal Search for Civil Judgments
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for state level civil legal judgments entered against them.
Liens Search
            We use 3rd party data sources to check the principal/owner of the business for liens placed against them.
Identity Verification (SSN)
            HomeAdvisor verifies the social security number(s) of the owner/principal for identity check purposes. This check applies primarily to smaller business entities.
Identity Verification (Reverse Phone Lookup)
            We conduct a reverse business phone lookup to identify records matching the phone number information provided by the business.








NOTE: Member service professional information confirmed as described above may change or expire over time; while HomeAdvisor attempts to maintain accurate and up-to-date information, and confirms changes when notified, we cannot guarantee that profile and screening information is accurate. Therefore, we recommend that before working with a service professional you verify that information presented is still current and/or acceptable to you.


Please see
        
        
        
          
          
            
            HomeAdvisor's Terms and Conditions for a full description of how we screen Service Professionals


**Only for U.S. service professionals 
















            HomeAdvisor's Screening Process
         
HomeAdvisor uses the following criteria to screen service professionals at the time they apply for membership in our network:







Licensing
Applicants must carry required state-level licensing to perform work in the trade and service area for which they apply.




Sex Offender Search
We check the official sex offender website in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match with the applicant.




Legal Search for Civil Judgments
We use third-party data sources to check the principal/owner of each business for bankruptcy filings and significant state-level civil legal judgments, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, occurring within 12 months prior to application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network.






Criminal Records Search
HomeAdvisor uses third-party sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for relevant criminal activity associated with the business owner/principal within three years prior to application.




State Business Filings
We confirm that service professionals applying as corporations or limited liability companies are in good standing in the state in which they are located.




Identity Verification (Social Security Number)
HomeAdvisor verifies the social security numbers of business owners/principals to confirm their identities. (This applies primarily to small businesses.)







            Notification to residents of AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, KY, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, WY: HomeAdvisor uses a third party to screen professionals. The comprehensiveness of the records included in the national criminal database which our third party vendor uses varies by state. Please be aware that your state may be limited in its reporting. For more information click on the "Instant Database Searches" tab on the following webpage:

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Richardson David Lee carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Richardson David Lee currently holds license 2101106154 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Richardson David Lee



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

‘Tithing’ as a ‘Sunday Morning Stickup’ Author Sues TD Jakes’ Potter’s House Church Brainuser1February 10, 2015BooksGospelNewsThisNThatTop News16 Comments7716 views


*When David Lee Richardson wrote a book that essentially implied tithing is a rip-off, it appears he didn’t think the consequences all the way through.
Especially since the church he held a leadership position in, was none other than the Dallas, Texas mega-church, The Potter’s House, founded by public figure Bishop T.D. Jakes.
Now, after being stripped of his title and told that he and his family are no longer welcome at the church, Richardson has filed a lawsuit.
The church has a congregational attendance rate of 17,000 and is home to familiar names like Sheryl Brady, Joby Brady, and Mark Jeffries.
Richardson’s book,  “Sunday Morning Stickup: What Your Pastor Doesn’t Want You To Know About Tithes,” – yep, that’s the title, is a self-published work.

Author Claims Book on Tithing Got Him Put Out of TD Jakes’ Church (Listen) EurPublisherJuly 20, 2014BusinessGospelNewsTop News31 Comments13957 views


*The tension is rising at The Potter’s House church in Dallas, Texas, and former church member David Lee Richardson is at the center of it all.
His new book entitled “The Sunday Morning Stickup: What Your Pastor Doesn’t Want You to Know About Tithes” has caused quite a stir among Bishop T.D. Jakes and the rest of the leadership in the church community.
Richardson explains that before the book had even been published, he was called into a private meeting where he was “…stripped of his ministerial license which [he] held for more than 20 years,” based on the cover of the book alone. Richardson claims that those focused on becoming wealthy from running their own churches feel extremely threatened by some of the messages and information within his book.
He and his two children were also physically escorted out of the church while attending a service a few weeks later, humiliating him in front of his children were traumatized by the fact that their father was removed from church by the police.
When Richardson questioned the police as to why he was removed, the police explained to Richardson that the church asked them to get rid of him and that he may not ever return to the church without the possibility of him being arrested.
Listen as Richardson explains the situation below:

 Today's Christian experience is not what it use to be. So much has changed. One visit to a Sunday morning service and you will know that this is not the church you grew up with. Churn and frustration are at an all time high as many have voted with their feet and no longer attend church service. Church-her thirst to be accepted by the world and possess what it has to offer has negatively impacted her preaching and influence on society. Silent, she has no response to the moral decay of our time, yet she takes in more money than most will earn in two life times. Product pitches from the pulpit and product tables in the lobby are normal and a guaranteed scriputural reference to paying tithes is envitable.Laboring over souls on the altar is a thing of the past as many ministries look for ways to be more profitable. Being about "My Father's Business" has taken on a whole new meaning as the North American Church struggles to hold to the code of Divine Ethics that was once delivered to the saints by those who once valued the concept of no compromise. Tonight on The Revolution Radio, we welcome author, David Lee, as we discuss the contents of his latest book, Sunday Morning Stickup what your pastor doesn't want you to know about tithes. We will cover this controversial subject of tithes with listner participation. What is the true essence of tithing? Am I cursed if I don't tithe? Does it really take millions of dollars to win souls to Christ? These and a host of other question will be covered in this one on one interview. Have your Bibles ready!
