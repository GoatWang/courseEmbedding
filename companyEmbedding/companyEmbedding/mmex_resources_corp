Our Experience              MMEX PRESS RELEASE 3-07-17   MMEX Resources Announces Plan to Build $450 Million Refinery in Permian Basin  50,000 barrels per day capacity state-of-the-art facility intends to leverage existing infrastructure, bring economic benefits to Fort Stockton, Texas area AUSTIN, TEXAS, March 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  MMEX Resources Corp. (OTCPK: MMEX), a global energy company focusing on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and infrastructure projects in Texas and South America, announced today that it plans to build a $450 million, 50,000 barrels per day capacity crude oil refinery in the West Texas Permian Basin, subject to the receipt of required governmental permits and completion of required debt and equity financing.  Located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad, the 250-acre facility intends to utilize its connection to existing railways to export diesel, gasoline, and jet fuels; liquefied petroleum gas; and crude oil to western Mexico and South America. Once completed, the Pecos County refinery will be one of the first oil refineries built in the United States in more than 40 years.  Jack W. Hanks, President & CEO of MMEX Resources Corp., commented: “The Permian Basin is the largest continuous oil discovery in America and has experienced exponential gains in daily production volume recently. The existing facilities and pipeline networks are largely unequipped to handle this growth and are limiting where products can be transported. By building a state-of-the-art refinery along the region’s existing railway infrastructure, we hope to bring a local and export market for crude oil and refined products which will add substantial job and economic growth to West Texas.”  MMEX plans to surround the Pecos County refinery with an additional 250 acres of buffer property and leverage state-of-the-art emissions technologies to yield minimal environmental impact. It also expects to feature closed-in water and air-cooling systems, which will require very little local water resources. Construction is slated to begin in early 2018, following the permitting process, and the facility is projected to begin operations in 2019.  The company anticipates the 18-month construction process will create approximately 400 jobs in the area during peak construction, as well as foster a significant number of indirect jobs and revenue for companies in catering, workforce housing, construction, equipment and other industries. Once operational, the facility is expected to provide an estimated 100 permanent jobs and generate substantial tax revenue for Pecos County.  The MMEX management team has more than 30 years of experience building and managing multi-million dollar gas processing, pipelines, power plants, refinery and oil and gas operations in Peru and the United States. MMEX purchased the rights to the project from Maple Resources Corporation. As with each of its previous projects, the management team will establish local offices and representatives to keep the surrounding communities informed throughout the construction phase and once the refinery is fully operational.  “MMEX Resources is eager to work alongside the Pecos County community to produce a state-of-the-art facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region. The safety of our employees, the neighboring community and the environment are our top priorities,” concluded Hanks.  About MMEX Resources Corp.

MMEX Resources Corp. (OTCMKTS: MMEX) “Poor liquidity & financial flexibility may impinge an otherwise attractive project”

MMEX Resources Corp. (OTCMKTS:MMEX), is a global energy company focusing on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and infrastructure projects in Texas and South America.
The company recently announced to build a $450 million refinery in the Permian Basin’s Pecos County. If approved, the proposed refinery will be able to process up to 50,000 barrels of crude oil per day and convert it into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and other products that will is expected to meet growing demand in Mexico.
Also, there has not been a new refinery built in the United States in more than 40 years & MMEX Resources project is the second one proposed to be built in Texas over the past six months.
 
Successful completion & commercialization of the Project is subject to the receipt of required governmental permits and more importantly, timely closure of incremental funding for the project. The Company has previously incurred continuous losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of approximately $30 million, a total stockholders deficit of approximately ~$2.9 million and has  also reported negative cash flows from operations since inception.
 
Description & manufacturing set-up:
MMEX Resources Corporation is an oil and gas company. The Company is engaged in the evaluation, acquisition and development of oil and gas, refining, power generation, natural gas transmission and processing energy projects in the western United States and Latin America. The Company was previously engaged in the exploration, extraction and distribution of coal.
 
About the management:
MMEX business profile is expected to leverage on the longstanding experience (above 3 decades) of its management. The management has extensive experience in building and managing multi-million dollar gas processing, pipelines, power plants, refinery and oil and gas operations in Peru and the United States. The company’s upcoming project is likely to benefit from the robust track record of its management.
 
Recent announcement:
The company recently announced plans to build a $450 million refinery in the Permian Basin’s Pecos County. The proposed refinery will be able to process up to 50,000 barrels of crude oil per day and convert it into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and other products that will be shipped by rail to meet growing demand in Mexico.
Project at a glance:
As per management, Pecos County Refinery is likely to benefit from large oil discoveries in the Permian Basin, which has off late become the hottest shale, play in the United States.
Presently, the existing facilities and pipeline networks are largely unequipped to handle this growth and are limiting where products can be transported. By building a state-of-the-art refinery along the region’s existing railway infrastructure, MMEX hope to bring a local and export market for crude oil and refined products, which will add substantial job and economic growth to West Texas.
MMEX has a contract on a 250-acre property next to the Sulfur Junction Spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad about 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton. The rail line starts in San Angelo to the border town of Presidio and then into Ojinaga, Chihuahua.
 
Outlook – proposed time line & synergies:
The company plans to complete an environmental assessment for the property before submitting a permit application to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and other agencies.  If approved by regulators, the 18-month construction process will create around 400 jobs while the completed refinery is expected to employ around 100 people.
The facility is likely to entail a total capex of around half billion dollars. Construction is proposed to commence from early 2018, following the permitting & approval process, and the plant is projected to begin commercial operations from 2019 onwards.
 
Basis high-level calculation, at maximum capacity, MMEX would have the ability to generate (assuming a crude oil price of at least $50/barrel) up to $2.5 million in gross revenue on a daily basis.
 
MMEX Resources is bullish to work alongside the Pecos County community to produce a state-of-the-art facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region.
 
Key Stock Influences
Some key influences that might govern future stock price performance include: 

The company’s financial risk profile is marked by poor liquidity and inadequate financial flexibility. MMEX has incurred continuous losses since inception and has a large accumulated deficit in its book. In fact the company has a history of illiquidity and cash crunch. Therefore, its ability to arrange required funding for the captioned project in a time bound manner is a significant contingency.
MMEX is burning through cash & do not have enough liquidity to run its existing activities. Its ability to continue as “an ongoing concern” is entirely dependent on its ability to raise additional capital. Therefore, any sort of inability to raise fund in a timely and prudent manner, could materially & adversely affect its operations. Also, additional capital is likely to lead to dilution in its present equity capital.
The legal framework, expected approvals, permits and clearances, surrounding the upcoming project is uncertain at the moment. Future regulatory developments in these areas and its impact on MMEX business will remain a critical business sensitivity factor for the company.

Earnings Review
MMEX have not yet begun to generate revenues. As per its latest available filing, as of July 31, 2016, it had current assets of $3,335, comprised of cash, and current liabilities of $2,758,554, resulting in a working capital deficit of $2,755,219.
Because of continuing operating losses, MMEX have not generated positive operating cash flows. As a result, they have significant short-term cash needs. As of yet, its principal source of operating capital has been provided from private sales of common stock and warrants and debt financing.

As demand for gasoline and other refined products continues to grow in Mexico, another company has emerged with plans to build a new refinery near the border.
MMEX Resources Corp (OTCPK: MMEX) announced plans on Tuesday to build a $450 million refinery in the Permian Basin's Pecos County.

If approved, the proposed refinery will be able to process up to 50,000 barrels of crude oil per day and convert it into gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and other products that will be shipped by rail to meet growing demand in Mexico.




MMEX Resources Corp CEO Jack Hanks said the Pecos County Refinery will take full advantage of large oil discoveries in the Permian Basin, which has become the hottest shale play in the United States.
"The existing facilities and pipeline networks are largely unequipped to handle this growth and are limiting where products can be transported," Hanks said in a statement. "By building a state-of-the-art refinery along the region’s existing railway infrastructure, we hope to bring a local and export market for crude oil and refined products which will add substantial job and economic growth to West Texas.”
MMEX Resources has a contract on a 250-acre property next to the Sulfur Junction Spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad about 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton. The rail line starts in San Angelo to the border town of Presidio and then into Ojinaga, Chihuahua.




 


The Austin-based company plans to complete an environmental assessment for the property before submitting a permit application to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and other agencies but Hanks reported there are already plans in the works to use a closed-loop air cooling system and a closed-loop water system to minimize the impact in the desert ecosystem.
If approved by regulators, the 18-month construction process will create around 400 jobs while the completed refinery is expected to employ around 100 people.
“MMEX Resources is eager to work alongside the Pecos County community to produce a state-of-the-art facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region," Hanks said. "The safety of our employees, the neighboring community and the environment are our top priorities."

Although there has not been a new refinery built in the United States in more than 40 years, the MMEX Resources project is the second one proposed to be built in Texas over the past six months.
In November, The Woodlands-based Raven Petroleum LLC announced plans to build a refinery near the South Texas town of Hebbronville where gasoline, diesel and other products would also be shipped by rail to meet growing demand in Mexico.

	Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement



	 


	On March 4, 2017, MMEX Resources Corporation (the “Company”) entered into an agreement with Maple Resources Corporation (“Maple”), a related party, to acquire all of Maple’s right, title and interest (the “Rights”) in plans to build a $450 million, 50,000 barrels per day capacity crude oil refinery in Pecos County, Texas (the “ Refinery Transaction” or the “Project”). Pursuant to the Refinery Transaction, the Company agreed to acquire the Rights in exchange for the issuance of 7,000,000,000 new common shares (the “Purchased Shares”).


	 


	Completion of the Project is subject to the receipt of required governmental permits and completion of required debt and equity financing. The Company has previously incurred continuous losses from operations, has an accumulated deficit of approximately $30 million, a total stockholders’ deficit of approximately $2.9 million and has reported negative cash flows from operations since inception. In addition, the Company does not currently have the cash resources to meet its operating commitments for the next twelve months. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and ability to meet the ongoing requirements for capital investment to implement its business plan must be considered in light of the problems, expenses and complications frequently encountered by entrance into established markets and the competitive environment in which the Company intends to operate. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional debt or equity capital.




	 







	Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities



	 


	The Refinery Transaction provides for the Company to issue the Purchased Shares in two tranches, of which the First Tranche of 1,500,000,000 shares was issued on March 4, 2017. The Second Tranche of 5,500,000,000 shares are to be issued once the Company Articles of Incorporation are amended to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, as more particularly described below. In addition, the Second Tranche amount of shares will be adjusted (up or down) subject to valuation of the Refinery Transaction by a third party outside consultant. The issuance of the shares pursuant to the Refinery Transaction is exempt from registration pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.


	 


	In order to issue the requisite number of shares contemplated by the Refinery Transaction and such other funding of the Company as may be required, the holders of a majority of the Company’s common stock have approved an amendment and restatement of the Articles of Incorporation to provide for an increase in the authorized shares of common stock from 3,000,000,000 to 10,000,000,000 shares. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation will be amended to provide for two classes of common shares: (i) Class A Shares, having one vote per share, and (ii) Class B Shares, with 10 votes per share. All of the outstanding shares of Common Stock will be reclassified as Class A Shares, except that all of the Purchased Shares will be Class B Shares. Other than the provisions of the voting rights, the two classes of shares of common stock will have equal terms and conditions. We will file a subsequent report on Form 8-K when the amended and restated Articles of Incorporation have been filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada.

	We previously reported that on October 28, 2016, the Company had entered into a Settlement Agreement and Stipulation (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc. (“RCP”) and that, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, RCP would exchange certain payables/claims for a settlement amount payable in common shares of the Company. We have issued a cumulative aggregate of 489,000,000 common shares pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and, as of March 9, 2017, have terminated any further obligation to issue shares pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The issuance of the shares under the Settlement Agreement was exempt from registration pursuant to exemption provided by Section 3(a) (10) of the Securities Act of 1933, by virtue of the October 2016 order of a circuit court in Florida confirming the fairness of the terms of the Settlement Agreement.




	 







	Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders



	 


	On March 7, 2017, the holders of more than 50.1% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company executed their written consent in lieu of special meeting as to the proposed amendment and restatement of the Articles of Incorporation described above.

	3.2 Ability to Bear Economic Risk

	. The Purchaser acknowledges that investment in the Shares involves a high degree of risk, and represents that it is able, without materially impairing its financial condition, to hold the Shares for an indefinite period of time and to suffer a complete loss of its investment. In addition, the Purchaser (i) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the Purchaser’s investment in the Shares and (ii) understands and has fully considered for purposes of this investment the risks of this investment and understands that (a) this investment is suitable only for an investor who is able to bear the economic consequences of losing its entire investment, (b) the Company has a limited financial and operating history, (c) the Shares represent an extremely speculative investment which involves a high degree of risk of loss, and (d) there are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Shares; accordingly, it may not be possible for the Purchaser to liquidate its investment in the Shares in case of emergency.

	3.3 Further Limitations on Disposition

	. The Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the offering and issuance of the Shares will not be registered under the Securities Act on the grounds that the offering and issuance of the Shares are exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and that the Company’s reliance upon such exemption is predicated upon the Purchaser’s representations set forth in this Agreement. The Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Shares must be held indefinitely and it cannot dispose of the Shares unless the offer and sale of the Shares is registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from registration is available.

	3.5

	The Purchaser is not relying on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents with respect to the tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and understands that the Purchaser (and not the Company) shall be responsible for the Purchaser’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser is not relying on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents for legal advice with respect to this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


	 



	3.5 Accredited Investor Status.

	The Purchaser is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act.


	 



	3.6 Further Assurances.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



	 



	MMEX Resources announces plan to build $450 million refinery in Permian Basin




	50,000 barrels per day capacity state-of-the-art facility intends to leverage existing infrastructure,




	bring economic benefits to Fort Stockton, Texas area



	 


	AUSTIN, TEXAS – March 7, 2017 – MMEX Resources Corp. (OTCPK: MMEX), a global energy company focusing on the acquisition, development and financing of oil, gas, refining and infrastructure projects in Texas and South America, announced today that it plans to build a $450 million, 50,000 barrels per day capacity crude oil refinery in the West Texas Permian Basin, subject to the receipt of required governmental permits and completion of required debt and equity financing.


	 


	Located 20 miles northeast of Fort Stockton, Texas, near the Sulfur Junction spur of the Texas Pacifico Railroad, the 250-acre facility intends to utilize its connection to existing railways to export diesel, gasoline, and jet fuels; liquefied petroleum gas; and crude oil to western Mexico and South America. Once completed, the Pecos County refinery will be one of the first oil refineries built in the United States in more than 40 years.


	 


	Jack W. Hanks, President & CEO of MMEX Resources Corp., commented: “The Permian Basin is the largest continuous oil discovery in America and has experienced exponential gains in daily production volume recently. The existing facilities and pipeline networks are largely unequipped to handle this growth and are limiting where products can be transported. By building a state-of-the-art refinery along the region’s existing railway infrastructure, we hope to bring a local and export market for crude oil and refined products which will add substantial job and economic growth to West Texas.”


	 


	MMEX plans to surround the Pecos County refinery with an additional 250 acres of buffer property and leverage state-of-the-art emissions technologies to yield minimal environmental impact. It also expects to feature closed-in water and air-cooling systems, which will require very little local water resources. Construction is slated to begin in early 2018, following the permitting process, and the facility is projected to begin operations in 2019.


	 


	The company anticipates the 18-month construction process will create approximately 400 jobs in the area during peak construction, as well as foster a significant number of indirect jobs and revenue for companies in catering, workforce housing, construction, equipment and other industries. Once operational, the facility is expected to provide an estimated 100 permanent jobs and generate substantial tax revenue for Pecos County.


	 


	The MMEX management team has more than 30 years of experience building and managing multi-million dollar gas processing, pipelines, power plants, refinery and oil and gas operations in Peru and the United States. MMEX purchased the rights to the project from Maple Resources Corporation. As with each of its previous projects, the management team will establish local offices and representatives to keep the surrounding communities informed throughout the construction phase and once the refinery is fully operational.


	 


	“MMEX Resources is eager to work alongside the Pecos County community to produce a state-of-the-art facility that opens up economic and job opportunities for the region. The safety of our employees, the neighboring community and the environment are our top priorities,” concluded Hanks.
