Specifications
This tea is originated from near one of the most beautiful scenic places called Huang Mountain, Anhui province in China.


This tea is originated from near one of the most beautiful scenic places called Huang Mountain, Anhui province in China (same province as Keemun’s).  It is picked with one bud and two leaves. The leaves are shaped like the tips of spears and parts of the stems are yellowish in color. During its processing, each tea leaf is ironed under a piece of cloth and each huge and flat tea leaf leaves noticeably with crisscross pattern on them.  This tea is characterized as fully hand-crafted and truly a sensational work of art. While steeping this tea, you will easily find the slow sinking and floating movements, like spears gathering together.  The taste is extraordinarily and wonderfully complex. Nutty at first sip and the sweetness of this tea gradually reveals itself as you continue to drink it. The liquor is a bright, clear, pale green and also has a lingering, sweet aftertaste with a hint of flowery overtones.  This tea has won a lots of global awards since 1915, the most current being the "King of Tea" award in China Tea Exhibition 2004.

Hand-tuftTai Ping's hand-tufted carpets combine superior fibres such as wools, silk and flax with custom-finishing techniques. Our hand-tufters take almost a decade to master their craft and have the skills required to produce carpets and rugs of the finest quality. Specialised techniques, including sculpting and carving, introduce texture and dimension.







Hand-knotHand-knotted in Nepal by local artisans, each rug is carefully crafted from natural fibres that retain their intimate connection to the earth. Using techniques and expertise passed down through generations, our craftsmen meticulously create one-of-a-kind works of art infused with the spiritual essence of their homeland. From carding to spinning and dyeing to finishing, our fully integrated manufacturing process guarantees full control over the entire production process to ensure unrivaled quality. Our expert design and sales teams closely oversee the entire process of creation, advising our clients at every step from conception to installation, in order to ensure an efficient, satisfying collaboration and the most successful end product.







Pass-tuftWhen speed and economical delivery are high priorities, pass machine-tufted production provides the best, most viable solutions for both commercial and residential applications. This technology yields single- or two-toned carpets in an infinite array of textures, with the possibility of over-tufting for design accent. Pass machine-tufted carpet can be made to fit irregular room shapes, with minimal wastage and cost.







Broadloom TuftTai Ping uses the latest broadloom graphic and textured tufting technology to make fashionable floor coverings for venues where the budget is as important as the design. Tufts are stitched into a backing fabric using advanced industrial technology to produce endless pattern options in multi-level cut and loop combinations and fibre options. This technique allows production of wall-to-wall carpets and carpet tiles.







 We have won international renown with our innovation and expertise steeped in a rich history, a celebrated archive, unparalleled design and service to the world's most discerning clientele.

Harvesting Season & Spring Plucking Time						



2017 Yu Qian / Before the Rains
2nd Spring Harvesting Season
(April 5th-April 20th)
 
China Spring Green Tea:
 
Chinese spring green teas are categorized by four seasonal designations indicating which time in the spring the tea was picked and manufactured. The earlier the tea is plucked the smaller the yield of that tea will be and the more expensive the tea will be. The earliest plucked teas are the most desirable for sweetness and delicacy, and the fever for these teas is high in China as well as in the West. Chinese spring green teas are only plucked once a year in their designated harvesting seasons.
 
 – Early spring plucked teas:
 
Pre-Qing Ming tea: 1st Spring Harvesting Season from end of March to before April 5th.
 
Pre-Qing Ming teas are the first teas plucked each new spring season. Depending on the location and altitude in each tea-producing region, leaf plucking can begin as early as the middle week of March and continue until April 5th.
 
Pre-Qing Ming teas command the highest prices because the demand for these teas outpaces the supply each spring. This is especially true for Famous Teas such as Gan Lu, Long Ding, Longjing, Lu Shan, Tai Ping Hou Kui, and Zhu Ye Qing.
 
Yu Qian /Before the Rain tea: 2nd Spring Harvesting Season from April 5th to April 20th
 
– Late spring plucked teas:
 
Gu Yu tea: 3rd Spring Harvesting Season from April 21st to May 6th
 
Li Xia tea: 4th Spring Harvesting Season from May 7th until
May 21st






Steeping Instructions:						



Use 1.5 Tablespoons (3 grams) per 6 oz water
Steep 2-3 infusions at 2 minutes each
Water temperature should be 160˚F-170˚F

Bob and I visited the Tai Ping Hou Kui tea production area on our first tea buying trip to China in 2000. The core production zone for Tai Ping Hou Kui tea is Hou Keng village in Xinming Township. Two nearby villages – Hou Gang and Xian Jia – also contribute to the production. These tea areas are in Tai Ping county, at the southern end of Tai Ping Lake, situated close to the stunning Huang Shan Mountains in Anhui Province.

The Tai Ping area is difficult to get to as there are no easy roads for driving to this remote place. For us to reach it, we hired a boat to take us down Tai Ping Lake. There, at the end of the lake, lies a pristine area surrounded by  pine and bamboo forests. This is where this glorious tea is made. The finished tea departs the village by boat too, as you can see in this photo of large bags of tea that have just been loaded for delivery to tea markets in Anhui and beyond.

Tai Ping Lake is a beautiful, man-made lake that supports mixed aqua-culture, and serves as an experimental station for agricultural and aquatic research. The tea gardens are located high in the mountains in areas that  generate moisture-laden blankets of ‘clouds & mist’ which keep the plants hydrated and protected from the hot afternoon sun. The area sees few visitors – at the time that we visited it was required that we obtain special visas from Beijing to allow us to visit this incredible place to observe the tea production.

Tai Ping Hou Kui is one of China’s most celebrated Famous Teas, and is a former Tribute Tea to the Chinese emperor. But today everyone has the opportunity to drink it!
Tai Ping Hou Kui is a large, long and flat tea that is very impressive in size. The size of the leaf has to do with the variety of tea bush cultivar that is grown for Tai Ping Hou Kui (Shi Da Ye ), the plucking standard, and the method of processing the fresh leaf. The plucking standard for this tea calls for it to be made from a bud embraced by two leaves. This tea is one of the few green teas (along with Xi Hu Longjing) that is ‘shaped and pressed’ (by hand or by machine) and not ‘rolled’ (by hand or by machine).
Tai Ping Hou Kui is made three ways and in three villages ( see above). The most expensive Tai Ping Hou Kui is Nie Jian from Hou Keng village, then Nie Jian from Hou Gang village, etc. So both production zone and method of manufacture determine price. Li Jian and Bu Jian manufacture are very different from that used for Nie Jian.

Nie Jian = hand-made Tai Ping Hou Kui: all major steps are done by hand. Shaping the long leaves, placing them on the screens and gently pressing them by hand during the firing steps
Li Jian =  mostly machine-made and the leaf is flattened gently with a mechanical roller
Bu Jian = same as Li Jian but the leaf is covered with a wet paper and firmly flattened with a mechanical roller

Nie Jian Tai Ping Hou Kui is made from the early spring pluckings that occur over 14 days. But for Li Jian and Bu Jian Tai Ping the tea bushes are plucked on average 7-8 times in a season.
If you look at the last picture at the bottom of this page you will see what standard Bu Jian Tai Ping Hou Kui looks like  – it is very different looking from the images of the hand-pressed Nie Jian we have again in 2017. Sadly, this is what most tea enthusiasts have experienced for Tai Ping Hou Kui not our carefully processed, nie jian hand-made tea.
Because we observed the production of traditional Tai Ping Hou Kuo 17 years ago ( when all the tea was still handmade) we have recently had detailed conversations with our colleagues in China to understand what is causing some Tai Ping Hou Kui to be so flat and stretched.
Now we understand – it is the use of mechanical rolling. Today, the steps of  processing are different but the final results are similar within the category of Nie Jian. Overall, the processing tools and the heat source have changed. Then, it was tea firing baskets over low charcoal fires. Today it is fire boxes with controlled and varied temperatures.
Because we have no pictures of modern Tai Ping Hou Kui processing, we will share with you our now ‘historic’ images of Tai Ping Hou Kui manufacture. The leaf still undergoes Sha Qing (kill-green) by hand in a tea firing pan (picture below) to reduce moisture and prepare the leaf for pressing/shaping/drying.

Following this, the leaves are individually hand-shaped and placed on a bamboo tray ( today a mesh screen)  in one layer not touching other leaves. The leaves are gently pressed by hand to flatten them and take shape.

Several tea firing baskets (today these are mesh screens inserted into the fire box at differing temperatures) were heated over charcoal embers of different temperatures ranging from 100 degrees to 60 degrees. The leaf was placed on rice paper in the top of the tea basket for 2-3 minutes and then gently pressed by hand as it sat over the heat. The leaf was moved to each of the different baskets (mesh screens) during this initial firing, and each time the leaf is again pressed by hand until the firing was complete. (Today, leaf is moved to different temperature positions in the fire box and paper is no longer used).
Both yesterday and today, upon close inspection of the tea leaf one can see the crosshatch marks from the weave of rice paper (or the mesh screening) embossed on the leaf.

So, we are thrilled to have this wonderful Nie Jian Tai Ping Hou Kui for our tea enthusiast customers. We hope to return to the tea factories in Tai Ping one day and update our photo presentation to show the modern-style processing.
Tai Ping Hou Kui is revered for its clean, elegant, refreshing, very sweet floral taste and deep flavor. The color of the leaf is an unusual blusih-green, and the are full and thick, folded rather than flattened. If you are able to steep this tea in a glass mug or heat-proof drinking glass then you will be able to watch these large tea leaves ‘dance’ in the water as they unfurl.
Tai Ping Hou Kui is a large and bulky tea and somewhat difficult to measure by tablespoon. This is one tea that really benefits from being weighed on a gram scale to avoid the disappointment of the inevitable inaccurate measuring of tea leaf this large when done by volume measure.
