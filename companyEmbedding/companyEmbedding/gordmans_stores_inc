History[edit]




A Gordmans store in Nampa, Idaho.


Richman-Gordman[edit]
In 1936, Dan Gordman quit his job at a Bloomingdale's in New York City and decided to move west in hopes of finding his own calling in life. A need for car repairs brought Gordman to Omaha, Nebraska, where he found a loving relationship with Esther Richman as well as a business relationship with her father Sam Richman. The company's origins went back to the early 20th century when Sam Richman opened a small clothing store in Omaha in 1915. Sam Richman's Outfitters to the Family occupied a small storefront block-long building at 16th and Chicago in downtown Omaha. Dan Gordman joined Sam as a full partner in the business and married his daughter Esther. Several years passed, and eventually the business had grown to occupy the entire building at 16th and Chicago. In 1948, a second store was opened in South Omaha, Nebraska and then Dan purchased Sam's remaining interest in the Company, and the name of the stores was changed to Richman Gordman.[2]
During the 1960s, Jerry and Nelson, Dan's sons, and his nephew Bob joined Dan in Richman Gordman and positioned the company for more aggressive expansion. In the early 1970s, the company expanded beyond Nebraska. Richman Gordman opened two stores in Des Moines, Iowa followed by another location in Topeka, Kansas. Richman Gordman's 10th store opened in Grand Island, Nebraska in 1974. Dan Gordman was among the first to incorporate central checkouts, shopping carts, and self-service shoes to Omaha and was also one of the first stores to be open on Sundays.
1/2 Price Store and Gordmans[edit]
In 1975, Dan opened a small test store in South Omaha at 25th and L Streets named the 1/2 Price Store. The concept was to sell Richman Gordman merchandise at half price. The concept led to the opening of six more 1/2 Price Stores in the 1970s and a separate corporate structure was built to accommodate the growing business. By the time the company celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1990, it operated 16 1/2 Price Store off-price department stores and 16 Richman Gordman department stores. In 1992, however, Richman Gordman filed for bankruptcy protection, and all of its department stores closed. The off-price department store division became the company's sole focus after it emerged from bankruptcy under the Richman Gordman 1/2 Price Stores name in 1993.
In 1996, the birth of Gordmans took three years, converting all 1/2 Price Stores into the Gordmans brand. The idea came from Dan's vision of providing name brands at a cost savings. The company decided to develop a new prototype store and attempted to improve the store's presentation. Out the combined efforts of hundreds of associates, the first two Gordmans stores opened in Tulsa, Oklahoma in August 1999.
Sun Capital Partners bought the company in 2008. It was taken public again in 2010 with Sun continuing to hold a majority stake.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Bloomberg reported that Gordmans was reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.[3] On March 13, 2017 Bloomberg announced that Gordmans had indeed filed for bankruptcy in Nebraska (In re Gordmans Stores Inc., 17-80304, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nebraska (Omaha).) with a liquidation deal struck with Tiger and Great American.[4] Stage Stores bought the stores and the Gordmans name and are expanding the brand once again.[5]

History[edit]




A Gordmans store in Nampa, Idaho.


Richman-Gordman[edit]
In 1936, Dan Gordman quit his job at a Bloomingdale's in New York City and decided to move west in hopes of finding his own calling in life. A need for car repairs brought Gordman to Omaha, Nebraska, where he found a loving relationship with Esther Richman as well as a business relationship with her father Sam Richman. The company's origins went back to the early 20th century when Sam Richman opened a small clothing store in Omaha in 1915. Sam Richman's Outfitters to the Family occupied a small storefront block-long building at 16th and Chicago in downtown Omaha. Dan Gordman joined Sam as a full partner in the business and married his daughter Esther. Several years passed, and eventually the business had grown to occupy the entire building at 16th and Chicago. In 1948, a second store was opened in South Omaha, Nebraska and then Dan purchased Sam's remaining interest in the Company, and the name of the stores was changed to Richman Gordman.[2]
During the 1960s, Jerry and Nelson, Dan's sons, and his nephew Bob joined Dan in Richman Gordman and positioned the company for more aggressive expansion. In the early 1970s, the company expanded beyond Nebraska. Richman Gordman opened two stores in Des Moines, Iowa followed by another location in Topeka, Kansas. Richman Gordman's 10th store opened in Grand Island, Nebraska in 1974. Dan Gordman was among the first to incorporate central checkouts, shopping carts, and self-service shoes to Omaha and was also one of the first stores to be open on Sundays.
1/2 Price Store and Gordmans[edit]
In 1975, Dan opened a small test store in South Omaha at 25th and L Streets named the 1/2 Price Store. The concept was to sell Richman Gordman merchandise at half price. The concept led to the opening of six more 1/2 Price Stores in the 1970s and a separate corporate structure was built to accommodate the growing business. By the time the company celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1990, it operated 16 1/2 Price Store off-price department stores and 16 Richman Gordman department stores. In 1992, however, Richman Gordman filed for bankruptcy protection, and all of its department stores closed. The off-price department store division became the company's sole focus after it emerged from bankruptcy under the Richman Gordman 1/2 Price Stores name in 1993.
In 1996, the birth of Gordmans took three years, converting all 1/2 Price Stores into the Gordmans brand. The idea came from Dan's vision of providing name brands at a cost savings. The company decided to develop a new prototype store and attempted to improve the store's presentation. Out the combined efforts of hundreds of associates, the first two Gordmans stores opened in Tulsa, Oklahoma in August 1999.
Sun Capital Partners bought the company in 2008. It was taken public again in 2010 with Sun continuing to hold a majority stake.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Bloomberg reported that Gordmans was reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.[3] On March 13, 2017 Bloomberg announced that Gordmans had indeed filed for bankruptcy in Nebraska (In re Gordmans Stores Inc., 17-80304, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nebraska (Omaha).) with a liquidation deal struck with Tiger and Great American.[4] Stage Stores bought the stores and the Gordmans name and are expanding the brand once again.[5]

History[edit]




A Gordmans store in Nampa, Idaho.


Richman-Gordman[edit]
In 1936, Dan Gordman quit his job at a Bloomingdale's in New York City and decided to move west in hopes of finding his own calling in life. A need for car repairs brought Gordman to Omaha, Nebraska, where he found a loving relationship with Esther Richman as well as a business relationship with her father Sam Richman. The company's origins went back to the early 20th century when Sam Richman opened a small clothing store in Omaha in 1915. Sam Richman's Outfitters to the Family occupied a small storefront block-long building at 16th and Chicago in downtown Omaha. Dan Gordman joined Sam as a full partner in the business and married his daughter Esther. Several years passed, and eventually the business had grown to occupy the entire building at 16th and Chicago. In 1948, a second store was opened in South Omaha, Nebraska and then Dan purchased Sam's remaining interest in the Company, and the name of the stores was changed to Richman Gordman.[2]
During the 1960s, Jerry and Nelson, Dan's sons, and his nephew Bob joined Dan in Richman Gordman and positioned the company for more aggressive expansion. In the early 1970s, the company expanded beyond Nebraska. Richman Gordman opened two stores in Des Moines, Iowa followed by another location in Topeka, Kansas. Richman Gordman's 10th store opened in Grand Island, Nebraska in 1974. Dan Gordman was among the first to incorporate central checkouts, shopping carts, and self-service shoes to Omaha and was also one of the first stores to be open on Sundays.
1/2 Price Store and Gordmans[edit]
In 1975, Dan opened a small test store in South Omaha at 25th and L Streets named the 1/2 Price Store. The concept was to sell Richman Gordman merchandise at half price. The concept led to the opening of six more 1/2 Price Stores in the 1970s and a separate corporate structure was built to accommodate the growing business. By the time the company celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1990, it operated 16 1/2 Price Store off-price department stores and 16 Richman Gordman department stores. In 1992, however, Richman Gordman filed for bankruptcy protection, and all of its department stores closed. The off-price department store division became the company's sole focus after it emerged from bankruptcy under the Richman Gordman 1/2 Price Stores name in 1993.
In 1996, the birth of Gordmans took three years, converting all 1/2 Price Stores into the Gordmans brand. The idea came from Dan's vision of providing name brands at a cost savings. The company decided to develop a new prototype store and attempted to improve the store's presentation. Out the combined efforts of hundreds of associates, the first two Gordmans stores opened in Tulsa, Oklahoma in August 1999.
Sun Capital Partners bought the company in 2008. It was taken public again in 2010 with Sun continuing to hold a majority stake.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Bloomberg reported that Gordmans was reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.[3] On March 13, 2017 Bloomberg announced that Gordmans had indeed filed for bankruptcy in Nebraska (In re Gordmans Stores Inc., 17-80304, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nebraska (Omaha).) with a liquidation deal struck with Tiger and Great American.[4] Stage Stores bought the stores and the Gordmans name and are expanding the brand once again.[5]

History[edit]




A Gordmans store in Nampa, Idaho.


Richman-Gordman[edit]
In 1936, Dan Gordman quit his job at a Bloomingdale's in New York City and decided to move west in hopes of finding his own calling in life. A need for car repairs brought Gordman to Omaha, Nebraska, where he found a loving relationship with Esther Richman as well as a business relationship with her father Sam Richman. The company's origins went back to the early 20th century when Sam Richman opened a small clothing store in Omaha in 1915. Sam Richman's Outfitters to the Family occupied a small storefront block-long building at 16th and Chicago in downtown Omaha. Dan Gordman joined Sam as a full partner in the business and married his daughter Esther. Several years passed, and eventually the business had grown to occupy the entire building at 16th and Chicago. In 1948, a second store was opened in South Omaha, Nebraska and then Dan purchased Sam's remaining interest in the Company, and the name of the stores was changed to Richman Gordman.[2]
During the 1960s, Jerry and Nelson, Dan's sons, and his nephew Bob joined Dan in Richman Gordman and positioned the company for more aggressive expansion. In the early 1970s, the company expanded beyond Nebraska. Richman Gordman opened two stores in Des Moines, Iowa followed by another location in Topeka, Kansas. Richman Gordman's 10th store opened in Grand Island, Nebraska in 1974. Dan Gordman was among the first to incorporate central checkouts, shopping carts, and self-service shoes to Omaha and was also one of the first stores to be open on Sundays.
1/2 Price Store and Gordmans[edit]
In 1975, Dan opened a small test store in South Omaha at 25th and L Streets named the 1/2 Price Store. The concept was to sell Richman Gordman merchandise at half price. The concept led to the opening of six more 1/2 Price Stores in the 1970s and a separate corporate structure was built to accommodate the growing business. By the time the company celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1990, it operated 16 1/2 Price Store off-price department stores and 16 Richman Gordman department stores. In 1992, however, Richman Gordman filed for bankruptcy protection, and all of its department stores closed. The off-price department store division became the company's sole focus after it emerged from bankruptcy under the Richman Gordman 1/2 Price Stores name in 1993.
In 1996, the birth of Gordmans took three years, converting all 1/2 Price Stores into the Gordmans brand. The idea came from Dan's vision of providing name brands at a cost savings. The company decided to develop a new prototype store and attempted to improve the store's presentation. Out the combined efforts of hundreds of associates, the first two Gordmans stores opened in Tulsa, Oklahoma in August 1999.
Sun Capital Partners bought the company in 2008. It was taken public again in 2010 with Sun continuing to hold a majority stake.
Bankruptcy[edit]
On March 6, 2017, Bloomberg reported that Gordmans was reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.[3] On March 13, 2017 Bloomberg announced that Gordmans had indeed filed for bankruptcy in Nebraska (In re Gordmans Stores Inc., 17-80304, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Nebraska (Omaha).) with a liquidation deal struck with Tiger and Great American.[4] Stage Stores bought the stores and the Gordmans name and are expanding the brand once again.[5]

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

MARKET RESEARCH





MARKETS SERVED BY GORDMANS STORES
					 

This section provides readers 
				with commercial intelligence on the markets in United States, 
				and the Cities and Towns in the country. This section gives both a narrative description (about 
				2215 pages) of the various matters 
				covered as well as provides readers with the ability to directly 
				use the Chapters (via Microsoft Word or compatible word 
				processors) to produce their own reports and documentation. 
				 Experienced users will be able to use the spreadsheet and 
				databases to generate highly detailed narrative reports, charts 
				and graphics - as well as sophisticated business and commercial 
				forecasts and models. The databases are provided in both Excel 
				spreadsheets (about 3660 spreadsheets) and an Access database 
				tables (about 3810 tables). Explanatory notes are provided as word processor
    documents or in PDF formats.  
 



The narrative
    is necessarily illustrative in its terminology and seeks to provide a basic
    degree of business logic and theory which indicates the rational applied in
    the forecasting and modelling methodology.


 



The databases provided are specifically
    designed to provide users with a uniform and consistent numeric measure of
    both (normally) quantifiable values as well as conceptual factors which are
    (usually) only capable of qualification. Experienced users will know how to
    apply forecasting and modelling software to the numeric data provided to
    generate highly detailed and discrete business planning models. The
    databases provided in this report can be used directly with databases on
    other product, markets and industries in other countries. The databases are
    specifically designed to be trans-national, currency neutral, inflation and
    purchasing parity adjusted, product parity and product equivalent adjusted,
    opportunity cost adjusted, and numerically compatible; they all can be
    linked or merged programmatically in business planning models to provide
    multi-national and multi-level analysis.





Before using the data provided please
    read the Database
    Introduction as well as the Notes and Definitions links found in
    each Chapter. There are subtle statistical nuances to some of the
    spreadsheets and databases which will help the user to fine-tune their
    models and forecasts to obtain maximum effect and greater accuracy. The
    database flow chart and database description should be consulted when
    applying statistical and modelling software.
