About Us

            At Cashbloom, we understand that choosing a funding source is a delicate decision. We value all applicants and view each business uniquely, taking all circumstances into consideration. The principals of our company come from a small business background, which is why we understand the day to day challenges and what it takes to be successful. We underwrite accordingly and want to fund a business in a way that the payback can be easily managed.  Because our goal is to keep businesses thriving, we tend to build long term relationships with all of our merchants.
            

Our company philosophy is simple: Don't be the biggest - be the BEST. We aim to provide an exceptional level of support to all of our merchants from application, to funding and most important, post funding. All merchants will receive a designated Account Executive to assist with the submission, a Funding Coordinator to make the funding process simple and a Renewal Funding Executive that provides continued client support after the funding.
            
Some of the Types of Business We Fund:


Restaurants
Beauty Salons
Clothing Stores
Auto Repair
Healthcare Providers
Lodging
Grocery Stores
Liquor Stores
Bars / Pubs





Why Choose Us?

DIRECT FUNDER: Most companies that offer working capital are brokers and resellers; they add unnecessary fees and delay the process whereas we are the funding source – no middle man.
HIGHEST APPROVAL RATIO: We find ways and reasons to approve accounts and say yes.
LOWEST RATES IN THE INDUSTRY: We reward premium merchants with premium rates.
TRUSTED: Over 88% of merchants renew their advance.
REPUTABLE: We are a trusted member and have earned an A rating through the Better Business Bureau (BBB).
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON WE ARE THE BETTER CHOICE IS... Our company philosophy. We strive to have a personalized, one-on-one long term business relationship with all our clients. We do not want to be the “biggest” provider – we strive only to be the BEST. Your account executive will be there to help guide you throughout the process, and most important, after you have been funded! We pride ourselves on providing exceptional customer service each and every day and we look forward to seeing how we can help you and your business.






Frequently Asked Questions
How Much Can I Get?

            The amount of your advance is based off of your business’ unique history.  Cashbloom can award a range of customized amounts from $5,000 to $500,000.
            
How Does Cashbloom Work?

            Once we confirm that your business is qualified for funding, the process is simple; we customize an advance based on your specific business needs.
            

            For example, say that your business needs $10,000, and has average monthly sales of $30,000. Cashbloom will advance you the $10,000 up front, and then your advance gets paid off over a period of 6-12 months through an agreed upon percentage of your daily credit card sales.
            
Do I Have To Switch Banks or Open a New Account?

            No; we're all about making this process as seamless as possible.  This is why we offer you the flexibility of using either your existing merchant account provider or even your own bank account.  No new accounts or bank switches necessary.
            
What’s Your Track Record?

            With over 10,000 businesses funded, an “A” rating by the Better Business Bureau and an 88% renewal rate, our commitments are strong and growing!
            
But What If I’m a Seasonal Business…Or… What If My Sales Fluctuate?

            At Cashbloom, we with work with the flow of your business; this is why we only base your repayment on a percentage of your sales, rather than a fixed amount.  This way, if you have a slower month, your repayment will be smaller.  It’s that simple.
            
What’s The Catch?

            With no application fees or collateral required, the real effort is taking the time to ask.  So give us a call or submit an inquiry today, we will be in contact soon with options for you and your business to consider.

Merchant Cash Advance
Merchant Cash Advances from $5,000 to $1,000,000 within 10 days.
Apply Now »





Merchant Cash Advance




A Merchant Cash Advance is a great alternative to traditional financing for small and medium size business.  By purchasing a portion of your businesses future credit card sales at a discount, an MCA provides cash now for your future sales. The repayment is simple as we take a small portion of your future credit card sales as repayment.  




Merchant Cash Advances from $5,000 to $1,000,000
Qualification:

Been in business for at least 1 month
Not in active BK
Minimum $5,000 a month in credit card sales

Here are some great attributes of a Merchant Cash Advance:
Cash Flow Friendly:  Because you pay a percentage of your credit sales, your repayment fluctuates with your own cash flow; If sales are lower you are repaying less!
Fast: Approvals are typically issued same day and accounts are typically funded in as fast as 24 hours.
High Approval: Unlike traditional financing personal credit score plays a small part in our underwriting model.
More Capital: In most instances you have access to more capital every 3-4 months 






What is a Merchant Cash Advance?





                A merchant cash advance is a convenient and swift way to get your business the working capital it needs. By purchasing a future portion of your credit card sales, a merchant cash advance provider will provide your business with an upfront, lump sum of cash.
                

                The process is designed to get you the funds your business needs with ease and speed in mind; a merchant cash advance is typically repaid in less than 12 months. With an agreed upon small percentage that works with the flow of your business, payback is just as simple.
                



Merchant Cash Advance VS Bank Loan


                Qualifying for a bank's business loan in today's economy has become very challenging and if you do not have excellent credit – virtually impossible. Other traditional sources of capital such as home equity loans and credit card loans are no longer options for many business owners. Therefore, a merchant cash advance is a smart alternative to traditional financing.

                






Merchant Cash Advance Funding Process






               Upon submitting the documents, we will review the account and issue a conditional approval with various options. Once an option is selected, the agreement will be e-mailed or faxed to you. After the executed contracts are received, Cashbloom will perform final verifications and issue the final approval. Subsequently, one of our funding coordinators will set up the preferred payback platform for the merchant.

Alternative Financing

What is Alternative Financing? Is it right for my business?





					Alternative financing was created to meet the underserved capital markets from traditional financing. Many businesses can’t or don’t want to go through the lengthy process of obtaining traditional financing. They need an infusion of capital for marketing/advertising, inventory purchase, staff hiring, renovations or just working capital and alternative financing is the answer.  While there are many forms of alternative financing, they all typically get paid back within 24 months. This allows the business to get have availability to obtain additional funds for other projects. Here are some of the reasons why alternative financing is the way to go:

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

I interned here this past quarter in the Investments Group and I absolutely loved it! All the employees up to the branch manager and the Senior Financial Advisors were just the nicest people you will ever get to work for. They really don't make you feel like just lowly interns, they give you actual work to do, which is a nice feeling because you feel like you're contributing more than just making copies or doing data entry.

Would recommend the internship for anyone pursuing a finance degree. You'll get the fun experience, the name on your resume, and they get fresh minds to help them out. It's a win-win for everyone!







Great place to recommend dairy farms and making butter, and most of all fantastic tax write-offs!

Keep away from Richard Braugh! 

He ran my account down to nothing!

About Us

            At Cashbloom, we understand that choosing a funding source is a delicate decision. We value all applicants and view each business uniquely, taking all circumstances into consideration. The principals of our company come from a small business background, which is why we understand the day to day challenges and what it takes to be successful. We underwrite accordingly and want to fund a business in a way that the payback can be easily managed.  Because our goal is to keep businesses thriving, we tend to build long term relationships with all of our merchants.
            

Our company philosophy is simple: Don't be the biggest - be the BEST. We aim to provide an exceptional level of support to all of our merchants from application, to funding and most important, post funding. All merchants will receive a designated Account Executive to assist with the submission, a Funding Coordinator to make the funding process simple and a Renewal Funding Executive that provides continued client support after the funding.
            
Some of the Types of Business We Fund:


Restaurants
Beauty Salons
Clothing Stores
Auto Repair
Healthcare Providers
Lodging
Grocery Stores
Liquor Stores
Bars / Pubs





Why Choose Us?

DIRECT FUNDER: Most companies that offer working capital are brokers and resellers; they add unnecessary fees and delay the process whereas we are the funding source – no middle man.
HIGHEST APPROVAL RATIO: We find ways and reasons to approve accounts and say yes.
LOWEST RATES IN THE INDUSTRY: We reward premium merchants with premium rates.
TRUSTED: Over 88% of merchants renew their advance.
REPUTABLE: We are a trusted member and have earned an A rating through the Better Business Bureau (BBB).
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON WE ARE THE BETTER CHOICE IS... Our company philosophy. We strive to have a personalized, one-on-one long term business relationship with all our clients. We do not want to be the “biggest” provider – we strive only to be the BEST. Your account executive will be there to help guide you throughout the process, and most important, after you have been funded! We pride ourselves on providing exceptional customer service each and every day and we look forward to seeing how we can help you and your business.






Frequently Asked Questions
How Much Can I Get?

            The amount of your advance is based off of your business’ unique history.  Cashbloom can award a range of customized amounts from $5,000 to $500,000.
            
How Does Cashbloom Work?

            Once we confirm that your business is qualified for funding, the process is simple; we customize an advance based on your specific business needs.
            

            For example, say that your business needs $10,000, and has average monthly sales of $30,000. Cashbloom will advance you the $10,000 up front, and then your advance gets paid off over a period of 6-12 months through an agreed upon percentage of your daily credit card sales.
            
Do I Have To Switch Banks or Open a New Account?

            No; we're all about making this process as seamless as possible.  This is why we offer you the flexibility of using either your existing merchant account provider or even your own bank account.  No new accounts or bank switches necessary.
            
What’s Your Track Record?

            With over 10,000 businesses funded, an “A” rating by the Better Business Bureau and an 88% renewal rate, our commitments are strong and growing!
            
But What If I’m a Seasonal Business…Or… What If My Sales Fluctuate?

            At Cashbloom, we with work with the flow of your business; this is why we only base your repayment on a percentage of your sales, rather than a fixed amount.  This way, if you have a slower month, your repayment will be smaller.  It’s that simple.
            
What’s The Catch?

            With no application fees or collateral required, the real effort is taking the time to ask.  So give us a call or submit an inquiry today, we will be in contact soon with options for you and your business to consider.

Merchant Cash Advance
Merchant Cash Advances from $5,000 to $1,000,000 within 10 days.
Apply Now »





Merchant Cash Advance




A Merchant Cash Advance is a great alternative to traditional financing for small and medium size business.  By purchasing a portion of your businesses future credit card sales at a discount, an MCA provides cash now for your future sales. The repayment is simple as we take a small portion of your future credit card sales as repayment.  




Merchant Cash Advances from $5,000 to $1,000,000
Qualification:

Been in business for at least 1 month
Not in active BK
Minimum $5,000 a month in credit card sales

Here are some great attributes of a Merchant Cash Advance:
Cash Flow Friendly:  Because you pay a percentage of your credit sales, your repayment fluctuates with your own cash flow; If sales are lower you are repaying less!
Fast: Approvals are typically issued same day and accounts are typically funded in as fast as 24 hours.
High Approval: Unlike traditional financing personal credit score plays a small part in our underwriting model.
More Capital: In most instances you have access to more capital every 3-4 months 






What is a Merchant Cash Advance?





                A merchant cash advance is a convenient and swift way to get your business the working capital it needs. By purchasing a future portion of your credit card sales, a merchant cash advance provider will provide your business with an upfront, lump sum of cash.
                

                The process is designed to get you the funds your business needs with ease and speed in mind; a merchant cash advance is typically repaid in less than 12 months. With an agreed upon small percentage that works with the flow of your business, payback is just as simple.
                



Merchant Cash Advance VS Bank Loan


                Qualifying for a bank's business loan in today's economy has become very challenging and if you do not have excellent credit – virtually impossible. Other traditional sources of capital such as home equity loans and credit card loans are no longer options for many business owners. Therefore, a merchant cash advance is a smart alternative to traditional financing.

                






Merchant Cash Advance Funding Process






               Upon submitting the documents, we will review the account and issue a conditional approval with various options. Once an option is selected, the agreement will be e-mailed or faxed to you. After the executed contracts are received, Cashbloom will perform final verifications and issue the final approval. Subsequently, one of our funding coordinators will set up the preferred payback platform for the merchant.

Alternative Financing

What is Alternative Financing? Is it right for my business?





					Alternative financing was created to meet the underserved capital markets from traditional financing. Many businesses can’t or don’t want to go through the lengthy process of obtaining traditional financing. They need an infusion of capital for marketing/advertising, inventory purchase, staff hiring, renovations or just working capital and alternative financing is the answer.  While there are many forms of alternative financing, they all typically get paid back within 24 months. This allows the business to get have availability to obtain additional funds for other projects. Here are some of the reasons why alternative financing is the way to go:

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. VERY GOOD

The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!

Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!

The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!

Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road.

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD

Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.







I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. 

The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. 

VERY GOOD







The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  

On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!







Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.

I have had many financial advisors before, but this is the first firm that I feel great about having on my side. Chris Parker, the rep I deal with is outstanding. I have had everything explained to me and Chris calls me about once a quarter to ask me if everything is going ok with the account. He also has me in for a yearly review.. The performance of my account is also very good - even in a down market, as that is where the rubber hits the road. VERY GOOD

The people here are very polite though I wasn't quite expecting a younger guy to be handling my account (fresh college grad?).  Very thorough and explained all the options available to me and made some suggestions based on my future plans/goals.  On a side note, I can now say I have a Swiss account.  YAY!

Chris Parker over there has been a rock star for me (I should plug Lisa Ball as well, who works behind the scenes). Super attentive, responsive, patient, totally on the ball. He proactively contacts me to catch up regularly -- which I need, and appreciate. He gets my goals and investment style, and has given me sound guidance. Highly recommended.
