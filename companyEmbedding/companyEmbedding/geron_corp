Company information[edit]
Geron, based in Menlo Park, California, was founded by gerontologist Michael D. West, now CEO of BioTime,[3] who secured initial venture capital investment in the company from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Venrock.[4] The company was incorporated in 1990 and began doing business in 1992. John A. Scarlett was appointed CEO in 2011.[5]
The company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board has included Nobel laureates James Watson, Gunter Blobel, and Carol Greider, as well as Leonard Hayflick, known for discovering that human cells divide for a limited number of times in vitro[6] (called the Hayflick limit).[7][8][9]
Drug candidates[edit]
Cancer therapies[edit]
Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products.

GRN163L, is a drug that targets telomerase.[10] In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University, GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.[11] Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the in vitro clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with multiple myeloma. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable.[12] As of November 2016, Geron is not undertaking any clinical trials using GRN163L.[13]
A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with prostate cancer was carried out at Duke University.[14] Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck.[15]
GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of paclitaxel, was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.[16]

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech.[17]
Telomerase activation[edit]
In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular senescence. The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for HIV called TAT0002, which is the saponin cycloastragenol in Chinese herb Astragalus propinquus.[18] Geron has granted a license to Telomerase Activation Sciences to sell TA-65, the telomerase activator agent also derived from astragalus.[19] In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.[20]
Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.[citation needed]
Stem cell therapies[edit]
On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.[21] GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of spinal cord injury through remyelination of damaged axons. This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.[22]
Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.[23]
Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013.[24]
GRNOPC1[edit]
Main article: Human embryonic stem cells clinical trials § Geron Spinal Cord Injury Trial
As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early myelinated glial cells, a type of cell that insulates nerve cells. For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.[25] In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.[26] The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011.
In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO is Geron founder Michael D. West, acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron [27][28] and later went on to restart the trial.[29]
Patent issues[edit]
Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from embryonic stem cells, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by Dr. James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[30] The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.[31]
In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and the non-profit patent-watchdog Public Patent Foundation.[32] They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist Jeanne Loring who stated that University of Wisconsin–Madison stem cell pioneer James Thomson's techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.[33] The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.[34] The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.[35]
As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.[36] WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.[37]
Politics[edit]
As a participant in the then-controversial stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress. In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, then Geron CEO Thomas Okarma spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.[38][39][40]

Company information[edit]
Geron, based in Menlo Park, California, was founded by gerontologist Michael D. West, now CEO of BioTime,[3] who secured initial venture capital investment in the company from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Venrock.[4] The company was incorporated in 1990 and began doing business in 1992. John A. Scarlett was appointed CEO in 2011.[5]
The company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board has included Nobel laureates James Watson, Gunter Blobel, and Carol Greider, as well as Leonard Hayflick, known for discovering that human cells divide for a limited number of times in vitro[6] (called the Hayflick limit).[7][8][9]
Drug candidates[edit]
Cancer therapies[edit]
Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products.

GRN163L, is a drug that targets telomerase.[10] In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University, GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.[11] Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the in vitro clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with multiple myeloma. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable.[12] As of November 2016, Geron is not undertaking any clinical trials using GRN163L.[13]
A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with prostate cancer was carried out at Duke University.[14] Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck.[15]
GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of paclitaxel, was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.[16]

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech.[17]
Telomerase activation[edit]
In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular senescence.

A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with prostate cancer was carried out at Duke University.[14] Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck.[15]
GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of paclitaxel, was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.[16]

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech.[17]
Telomerase activation[edit]
In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular senescence. The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for HIV called TAT0002, which is the saponin cycloastragenol in Chinese herb Astragalus propinquus.[18] Geron has granted a license to Telomerase Activation Sciences to sell TA-65, the telomerase activator agent also derived from astragalus.[19] In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.[20]
Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.[citation needed]
Stem cell therapies[edit]
On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.[21] GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of spinal cord injury through remyelination of damaged axons. This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.[22]
Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.[23]
Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013.[24]
GRNOPC1[edit]
Main article: Human embryonic stem cells clinical trials § Geron Spinal Cord Injury Trial
As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early myelinated glial cells, a type of cell that insulates nerve cells. For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.[25] In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.[26] The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011.
In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO is Geron founder Michael D. West, acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron [27][28] and later went on to restart the trial.[29]
Patent issues[edit]
Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from embryonic stem cells, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by Dr. James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[30] The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.[31]
In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and the non-profit patent-watchdog Public Patent Foundation.[32] They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist Jeanne Loring who stated that University of Wisconsin–Madison stem cell pioneer James Thomson's techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.[33] The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.[34] The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.[35]
As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.[36] WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.[37]
Politics[edit]
As a participant in the then-controversial stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress. In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, then Geron CEO Thomas Okarma spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.[38][39][40]

Company information[edit]
Geron, based in Menlo Park, California, was founded by gerontologist Michael D. West, now CEO of BioTime,[3] who secured initial venture capital investment in the company from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Venrock.[4] The company was incorporated in 1990 and began doing business in 1992. John A. Scarlett was appointed CEO in 2011.[5]
The company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board has included Nobel laureates James Watson, Gunter Blobel, and Carol Greider, as well as Leonard Hayflick, known for discovering that human cells divide for a limited number of times in vitro[6] (called the Hayflick limit).[7][8][9]
Drug candidates[edit]
Cancer therapies[edit]
Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products.

GRN163L, is a drug that targets telomerase.[10] In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University, GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.[11] Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the in vitro clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with multiple myeloma.

The company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board has included Nobel laureates James Watson, Gunter Blobel, and Carol Greider, as well as Leonard Hayflick, known for discovering that human cells divide for a limited number of times in vitro[6] (called the Hayflick limit).[7][8][9]
Drug candidates[edit]
Cancer therapies[edit]
Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several anti-cancer products.

GRN163L, is a drug that targets telomerase.[10] In studies conducted at Johns Hopkins University, GRN163L was active against both CD138+ and CD138neg cancer stem cells and eliminated the colony forming potential of both by five weeks.[11] Similarly, GRN163L inhibited the in vitro clonogenic growth of CD138neg Multiple Myeloma Cancer Stem Cells isolated from the bone marrow aspirates of patients with multiple myeloma. On November 3, 2014, the FDA removed the full clinical hold on imetelstat and declared the company's clinical development plan as acceptable.[12] As of November 2016, Geron is not undertaking any clinical trials using GRN163L.[13]
A trial of GRNVAC1, a telomerase vaccine being used on patients with prostate cancer was carried out at Duke University.[14] Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck.[15]
GRN1005, an LRP-directed conjugate of paclitaxel, was in phase II clinical trials for brain cancer but discontinued based on preliminary results in 2012.[16]

In 2014 Geron exclusively licensed imetelstat to Janssen Biotech.[17]
Telomerase activation[edit]
In addition to testing drug candidates that exploit cancer cell's dependence on telomerase, Geron is researching the possible applications of activating the enzyme in normal cells to delay cellular senescence. The company is in the early stages of developing a telomerase based treatment for HIV called TAT0002, which is the saponin cycloastragenol in Chinese herb Astragalus propinquus.[18] Geron has granted a license to Telomerase Activation Sciences to sell TA-65, the telomerase activator agent also derived from astragalus.[19] In October 2010 Intertek/AAC Labs, an ISO 17025 internationally recognized lab, found the largest component of TA-65 to be Cycloastragenol.[20]
Geron originally investigated telomerase as a means of understanding and modifying human aging. However, Geron has ceased aging research of any kind.[citation needed]
Stem cell therapies[edit]
On January 23, 2009, Geron received FDA approval to begin Phase I testing of GRNOPC1 in humans.[21] GRNOPC1 is an embryonic stem cell based drug that is designed to treat specific forms of spinal cord injury through remyelination of damaged axons. This trial does not involve direct use of stem cells however, as GRNOPC1 is composed of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cell lines. Studies have shown significant restoration of mobility in animals with spinal injuries that received cells.[22]
Geron also has several other embryonic stem cell treatments that are still in the preclinical phase, including GRNCM1, a treatment for heart disease, and GRNIC1, a treatment for diabetes. In tests with diabetic mice, 80% of the mice given GRNIC1 were still alive in 50 days while the entire control group, which was given no treatment, perished.[23]
Geron sold its human stem cell research assets to Asterias in 2013.[24]
GRNOPC1[edit]
Main article: Human embryonic stem cells clinical trials § Geron Spinal Cord Injury Trial
As of October 2010 and November 2010, One of Geron's most highly publicized trial therapy products has been GRNOPC1, a stem cell therapy designed to heal severe spinal cord injuries. The cells in the GRNOPC1 therapy have been coaxed into becoming early myelinated glial cells, a type of cell that insulates nerve cells. For every GRNOPC1 cell that is injected in the patient, they become six to 10 cells in a few months.[25] In Oct 2011 updated results on 4 patients were released.[26] The trial was discontinued in Nov 2011.
In early 2013 BioTime, whose CEO is Geron founder Michael D. West, acquired 400 patents and other intellectual property related to embryonic stem cells from Geron [27][28] and later went on to restart the trial.[29]
Patent issues[edit]
Geron Corporation initially held exclusive rights to three cell types derived from embryonic stem cells, as the result of paying for the research originally conducted by Dr. James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[30] The patents on the other three cell types are owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF). WARF and Geron did not charge academics to study human stem cells but did charge commercial users. In 2001 WARF came under public pressure to widen access to human stem-cell technology, and they launched legal action against Geron Corporation to recover some of the previously sold rights. The two sides agreed that Geron would keep the rights to only three cell types.[31]
In October 2006, a legal challenge was mounted to overturn these patents by The Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights and the non-profit patent-watchdog Public Patent Foundation.[32] They contended that two of the patents granted to WARF are invalid because they cover a technique published in 1992 for which a patent had already been granted to an Australian researcher. Another part of the challenge came from the molecular biologist Jeanne Loring who stated that University of Wisconsin–Madison stem cell pioneer James Thomson's techniques (currently patents held by WARF) are rendered obvious by a 1990 paper and two textbooks.[33] The outcome of this legal challenge was particularly relevant to the Geron Corporation as it can only license patents that are upheld.[34] The patents were ultimately upheld when the reexamination concluded in 2008.[35]
As an interim measure, on January 23, 2007 WARF relaxed the stem cell patents, allowing industry-sponsored research at academic and non-profit institutions without a license.[36] WARF will allow easier and simpler cost free cell transfers among researchers and would not require a license or agreement from California's taxpayer-funded stem cell research program.[37]
Politics[edit]
As a participant in the then-controversial stem cell and cloning area, Geron Corporation was asked to testify about its technology before the U.S. Congress. In 2001, when Congress was attempting to ban all forms of cloning, then Geron CEO Thomas Okarma spoke before Congress to preserve cloning for therapeutic purposes.[38][39][40]

Telomerase | Scientific Rationale | Geron




















Telomerase: Scientific Rationale




Nobel Prize Winning Science
Cell division plays a critical role in the normal growth, maintenance and repair of human tissue. Telomeres are repeated sequences of DNA at the ends of each chromosome, and are key genetic elements involved with the regulation of cell division. Telomeres shorten every time a cell divides, and once telomeres reach a critically short length, the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces.
Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division. Telomerase consists of at least two essential components: an RNA template, which binds to the telomere, and a catalytic subunit with reverse transcriptase activity, which adds the specific DNA sequence to the chromosome ends each time a cell divides.


Telomeres


Telomerase


Telomerase is repressed in most normal cells, allowing telomere length to gradually decrease and preventing uncontrolled proliferation. In tissues that have a high turnover throughout life, such as blood and gut, telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to maintain telomeres and enable controlled, self-limited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural processes. As the progeny of progenitor cells mature, telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division, preventing uncontrolled proliferation.
The 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase. The Nobel laureates were early Geron collaborators, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak.
A Hallmark of Cancer
A fundamental trait of cancer cells is the ability to sustain chronic and uncontrolled proliferation, as described in the recent paper: “Hallmarks of Cancer”.
Telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately 90% of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers. Through the abnormal and sustained upregulation of telomerase, malignant cells acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis, enabling the continued and uncontrolled proliferation that drives tumor growth and progression.


Normal Cells


Cancer Cells


A Molecular Target in Oncology
We believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant cells. Hematologic or blood cancers arise from malignant progenitor cells in the bone marrow and may be particularly susceptible to telomerase inhibition. Telomerase activity has been observed to be significantly increased and the average telomere length to be significantly shorter in patients with certain hematologic malignancies compared with healthy individuals. In addition, high telomerase activity has been associated with shorter overall survival of patients in some hematologic malignancies.
We developed imetelstat as a potential cancer treatment to inhibit telomerase activity and thereby impede proliferation of malignant cells.

About Imetelstat




Originally known as GRN163L, imetelstat sodium (imetelstat) is a 13-mer N3’---P5’ thio-phosphoramidate (NPS) oligonucleotide that has a covalently bound 5’ palmitoyl (C16) lipid group. The proprietary nucleic acid backbone provides resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases, thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues, as well as significantly improved binding affinity to its target. The lipid group enhances cell permeability to increase potency and improve pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The compound has a long residence time in bone marrow, spleen and liver. Imetelstat binds with high affinity to the template region of the RNA component of telomerase, resulting in direct, competitive inhibition of telomerase enzymatic activity, rather than elicit its effect through an antisense inhibition of protein translation. Imetelstat is administered by intravenous infusion.


Imetelstat


Imetelstat Bound to Telomerase


Preclinical Studies with Imetelstat
A series of preclinical efficacy studies of imetelstat have been conducted by Geron scientists and academic collaborators. These data showed that imetelstat:

Inhibits telomerase activity, and can shorten telomeres.
Inhibits the proliferation of a wide variety of tumor types, including solid and hematologic, in cell culture systems and rodent xenograft models of human cancers, impacting the growth of primary tumors and reducing metastases.
Inhibits the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells from hematologic cancers, such as multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative neoplasms and acute myelogenous leukemia.
Has additive or synergistic anti-tumor effect in a variety of cell culture systems and xenograft models when administered in combination with approved anti-cancer therapies, including radiation, conventional chemotherapies and targeted agents.

Clinical Experience with Imetelstat
Over 500 patients have been enrolled and treated in imetelstat clinical trials.
Phase 1
Six clinical trials evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics both as a single agent and in combination with standard therapies in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies:

Single agent studies of imetelstat were in patients with advanced solid tumors, multiple myeloma and chronic lymphoproliferative diseases. Combination studies with imetelstat were with bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, with paclitaxel and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Doses ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 11.7 mg/kg were tested in a variety of dosing schedules ranging from weekly to once every 28 days.
The human pharmacokinetic profile was characterized in clinical trials of patients with solid tumors and chronic lymphoproliferative diseases. Single-dose kinetics showed dose-dependent increases in exposure with a plasma half-life (t1/2) ranging from 4-5 hours. Residence time in bone marrow is long (0.19-0.51 µM observed at 41-45 hours post 7.5 mg/kg dose).
Telomerase inhibition was observed in various tissues where the enzymes's activity was measurable.

Phase 2
Imetelstat was studied in two randomized clinical trials, two single arm proof-of-concept studies and an investigator sponsored pilot study:

Randomized trials were in combination with paclitaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer and as maintenance treatment following a platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen in patients with NSCLC.
Single arm studies were as a single agent or in combination with lenalidomide in patients with multiple myeloma and as a single agent in essential thrombocythemia (ET) or polycythemia vera (PV).
An investigator sponsored study was as a single agent in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

Safety and Tolerability
The safety profile of imetelstat across the Phase 1 and 2 trials has been generally consistent. Reported adverse events (AEs) and laboratory investigations associated with imetelstat administration included cytopenias, transient prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; assessed only in Phase 1 trials), gastrointestinal symptoms, constitutional symptoms, hepatic biochemistry abnormalities, and infusion reactions.
Hematologic Myeloid Malignancies
Early clinical data, including molecular responses in ET and remissions, including reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in MF, suggest imetelstat may have disease-modifying activity by inhibiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones for the underlying diseases.

Proof-of-Concept in Essential Thrombocythemia
A Phase 2 multi-center, single agent and open label trial was conducted in 18 patients with ET to provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of imetelstat as a treatment for hematologic myeloid malignancies, such as MF, MDS or AML. Published results (Baerlocher GM, et al. Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat in Patients with Essential Thrombocythemia. N Engl J Med. 2015 Sep 3; 373(10):920-8) are summarized as follows:

18 of 18 patients (100%) achieved a hematologic response with a reduction in platelets, including 16 of 18 patients (89%) achieving a complete response with a normalization of platelet counts.
The median time on therapy was 17.1 months (range: 6.9 months to 2.7 years).
Seven out of the eight (88%) patients with a JAK2 V617F gene mutation achieved 72% to 96% reductions in allele burden and qualified as partial molecular responses.
MPL and CALR mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15% to 66%.
The nature of adverse events reported were similar to those reported in other imetelstat clinical trials, with fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic biochemistry abnormalities and cytopenias being the most frequently observed.

Pilot Study in Myelofibrosis
An open label, single agent, investigator sponsored, pilot study of 33 patients with intermediate-2-risk or high-risk MF, including 16 who had received prior therapy with a JAK inhibitor, was conducted at a single center. Published results (Tefferi A, et al. A Pilot Study of the Telomerase Inhibitor Imetelstat for Myelofibrosis. N Engl J Med. 2015 Sep 3; 373(10):908-19) are summarized as follows:

Seven of 33 (21%) patients achieved a complete or partial remission, bone marrow fibrosis was reversed in all four patients who had a complete remission, and a molecular response also occurred in three of the four patients. Median duration of complete remission was 18 months (range: seven months to 20+ months).
Spleen responses (by palpation lasting greater than 12 weeks) were observed in eight of 23 (35%) patients. Spleen responses were observed in three of 11 (27%) patients from the JAK inhibitor experienced subgroup.
The most clinically significant adverse events were hematologic. Myelosuppression was the primary reason for the protocol-mandated dose reduction that occurred in 22 out of 33 patients (67%).

Pilot Study in Myelodysplastic Syndromes
An open label, single agent, investigator sponsored, pilot study of nine anemic patients with intermediate-1 or intermediate-2 risk MDS-RARS (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts), including eight who were dependent on red blood cell transfusions and six who had received prior therapy with an ESA, was conducted at a single center. Published results (Tefferi A, et al. Imetelstat Therapy in Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts with or without Thrombocytosis. Blood Cancer Journal 2016 Mar online) are summarized as follows:

Three of eight (38%) transfusion dependent patients became transfusion independent, defined as not requiring transfusions for at least eight weeks. Median duration was 28 weeks (9, 28 and 37 weeks respectively).
Safety data were consistent with the pilot study in MF.

Current Clinical Trials
Imetelstat is currently being tested in two clinical trials:  IMbark, a Phase 2 trial in MF, and  IMerge, a Phase 2/3 trial in MDS. These clinical trials are being conducted by  Janssen Biotech, Inc. under the terms of an exclusive worldwide collaboration and license agreement. Information about the status of these clinical trials can be found on our Investors pages.

Geron: Investor Relations: InvestorsInvestorsCorporate Profile
Geron is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies. Imetelstat is currently being tested in two clinical trials: IMbark™, a Phase 2 trial in myelofibrosis (MF) and IMerge™, a Phase 2/3 trial in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). These clinical trials are being conducted by Janssen Biotech, Inc., under a collaboration and license agreement, in which Janssen were granted the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses.Telomerase is an enzyme that enables cancer cells, including malignant progenitor cells, to maintain telomere length, which provides them with the capacity for limitless, uncontrolled proliferation. Using Geron’s proprietary nucleic acid chemistry, imetelstat was designed as an oligonucleotide that targets and binds with high affinity to the active site of telomerase, thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity and impeding malignant cell proliferation. Early clinical data, including molecular responses in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and remissions, including reversal of bone marrow fibrosis in MF, suggest imetelstat may have disease-modifying activity by inhibiting the progenitor cells of the malignant clones for the underlying diseases.
