Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Nevada:













Does Jch Construction Llc carry a valid contracting license?



Nevada requires all contractors engaged in the business of residential or commercial construction to be licensed by the Nevada State Contractors Board. 
Jch Construction Llc currently holds license 0074297 (B2 Residential & Small Commercial), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Nevada?



The qualifying individual for a contractor’s license is required to pass the written Business and Law (Construction Management Survey exam) and trade examinations unless he or she meets the requirements for a waiver. 











Your liability risk when hiring Jch Construction Llc



Licensed contractors in Nevada must maintain an active workers' compensation insurance policy. State law does not require contractors to carry general liability insurance, but it is always a good idea to only hire contractors who are covered under an up to date policy. Request copies of the insurance certificates for both general liability and workers compensation. 











Financial recourse when hiring Jch Construction Llc



Licensed contractors in Nevada must obtain a surety bond before performing any construction related work. Homeowners may file claims against this bond in the event of faulty workmanship, breach of contract. In addition, homeowners of single-family residences who have entered into a contract with a licensed residential contractor since October 1, 1999, have suffered actual damages, and have exhausted all other means of recovery, may submit a claim on the Residential Recovery Fund established by the Nevada legislature.











What else should I know before hiring Jch Construction Llc



All licensed contractors in Nevada must submit their fingerprints for the purpose of conducting a criminal background check. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Nevada, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
