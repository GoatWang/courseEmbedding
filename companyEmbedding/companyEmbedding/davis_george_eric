Davis, George P.
B. 1939
Davis is remembered on island for the Morning Glory Cafe on Old South Wharf which was decorated with his trompe l’olel images. And for his Wedgwood ceramics in a Nantucket Basket design.
He exhibited at the Main Street Gallery.
Davis started the Granary Gallery with Eric Holch in 1978 on Old South Wharf, then opened the adjoining Morning Glory Café which sported his whimsical murals. He moved to a store on Centre Street to conduct interior design and display his Wedgewood Nantucket china, modeled after Nantucket baskets. Davis lives in the Old Town district of Key West, Florida, and still visits Nantucket.
