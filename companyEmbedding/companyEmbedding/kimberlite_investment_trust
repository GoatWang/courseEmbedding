Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments

Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients

A New Investment Bank, Kimberlite, to Focus on Advice

Wall Street’s big banks advertise themselves as full-service shops, boasting that they can offer a range of services to institutional clients. But one new investment bank is taking the opposite approach.
The Kimberlite Group, a boutique firm that will open its doors on Tuesday, says its specialized focus is a benefit. The firm plans to offer only advice and merchant banking services, without underwriting, lending or trading businesses. And it plans to focus on two areas — real estate and financial institutions. 
 The business model is heavily dependent on the combined Rolodexes of the four founding principals, led by Thomas F. O’Neill, a founder of the investment bank Sandler O’Neill, and Michael D. Coster, who once ran the real estate fund advisory group at Lazard. By taking a narrow focus, they hope to avoid the possible conflicts that can come with bigger firms.
“It gets to be a little unwieldy,” the 66-year-old Mr. O’Neill said. “We felt we could be of better service to our clients by being independent.”
The founders — who also include Kenneth B. Hamlet, a former chief executive of Holiday Inns, and Alan J. Pomerantz, a senior counsel at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman — started Kimberlite by buying the real estate advisory unit of Ranieri Partners, where Mr. O’Neill and Mr. Coster most recently worked. That deal closed in September.
Mr. O’Neill, who ran the financial services group at Ranieri Partners after 22 years at Sandler O’Neill, said that  he was splitting from Ranieri because of a desire to move to a smaller operation and that the separation was amicable. Lewis S. Ranieri, the chairman of Ranieri Partners, who is known on Wall Street as a pioneer of mortgage securities, will be a senior adviser to Kimberlite. 
In the years since the financial crisis, boutique investment banks have gained market share by emphasizing their specialization. By refraining from publishing research or trading for their own account, their argument goes, smaller banks can avoid conflicts of interest.
The giants of Wall Street rule the rankings of deal advisers, but small banks have had prominent roles in some big deals this year, including the $23 billion sale of H.J. Heinz, in which Lazard was the lead adviser to the buyers, Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. Lazard currently ranks 10th this year in worldwide mergers and acquisitions by value, according to Thomson Reuters.
Two small banks that have sprung up in recent years have climbed to formidable positions in the league tables. Moelis & Company, which was founded in 2007 by Kenneth D. Moelis, a former UBS banker, ranks 13th worldwide, while Centerview Partners, founded in 2006, is in 14th place, Thomson Reuters data shows.
To stand out as a small bank, it helps to be narrowly focused, said Joel Jeffrey, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
“The firms that focus primarily on the advisory side of the business are likely to be more successful than ones that do more of a far-reaching and comprehensive brokerage platform,” Mr. Jeffrey said. “People are valuing advice that is independent from where they get the financing.”
At the same time, big banks have shown that there remains plenty of demand for the full-service model. JPMorgan Chase, which is ranked third in the Thomson Reuters league table, said in its 2012 annual report that its “scale and broad cross-market capabilities,” like offering both advice and financing for deals, were useful for clients.
But Kimberlite’s role is different from that of the big banks, said Mr. Coster, who is a co-chief executive of the new firm along with Mr. O’Neill. Catering to institutional investors, real estate companies and financial firms, Kimberlite is aiming to act as a trusted adviser.
“Nobody can distribute product faster or more efficiently than Wall Street. But it’s still a product,” Mr. Coster, 52, said. “We’re helping clients think through what the right product is.”
Kimberlite — whose name refers to the volcanic rock in which diamonds can be found — has more than a dozen active engagements with clients in its real estate and financial groups, said Mr. Coster, who runs the firm’s real estate practice. Mr. O’Neill runs the financial institutions group, and Mr. Hamlet is chairman of the firm.
Mr. O’Neill, the most senior banker in the room, isn’t the only Kimberlite founder to have started a small bank in the past. After leaving Lazard, Mr. Coster co-founded Occom Capital Partners, which was sold to Ranieri Partners in 2011.
With just 14 employees including its founders, Kimberlite is settling into office space in Midtown Manhattan that it is subletting from Ellis Lake Capital. A paper sign with the firm’s name was hanging last week from the office door. 
But the firm is more established than its spare environs suggest. A table in the office was cluttered with Lucite tombstones, a visual reminder of the many deals done by the founders over the years.
“This is not a start-up,” Mr. O’Neill said. “It’s an old business, just a new company.”

Lucapa Diamond Co

TDEM results upgrade kimberlite targets at Lulo

RNS Number : 8617L Lucapa Diamond Company Limited 24 July 2017  

 
 
 
 
 
ASX Announcement
 
24 July 2017
 

 

TDEM RESULTS UPGRADE KIMBERLITE TARGETS AT LULO

 

 
·    Extensive 8,566 line km Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) survey at Lulo identifies 11 new electromagnetic (EM) conductive kimberlite exploration targets of up to 150 hectares with little or no previous magnetic signature
 
·    5 of the new EM targets are located along drainage systems feeding into the high-interest Mining Block 8 area, a prolific producer of large and premium-value alluvial diamonds. Further three located near the previously-defined L165-L170 area of interest
 
·    TDEM data, and re-interpretation of existing magnetic data, has also enabled all kimberlite targets in the Cacuilo Valley to be reclassified in order of prospectivity
 
·    This reclassification and accessibility will guide updated 2017 drilling, laboratory analysis and sampling programs, which aim to identify the primary kimberlite sources of the exceptional Lulo alluvial diamonds. First laboratory results due this Quarter
 
·    Lulo kimberlite exploration program now funded from Lucapa's share of distributions from the Lulo alluvial mining operations, thus achieving primary objectives
Lucapa Diamond Company Limited (ASX: LOM) ("Lucapa" or "the Company") and its partners, Empresa Nacional de Diamantes E.P. ("Endiama") and Rosas & Petalas, are pleased to provide an update on the kimberlite exploration program at the Lulo Diamond Project in Angola.
 
The kimberlite exploration program aims to locate the primary hard rock sources of the large and premium-value Lulo alluvial diamonds, production from which Lulo achieved the highest per carat sale prices (US$2,983) in the world in 2016. 
 
The latest step in the Lulo kimberlite exploration program involved a helicopter-borne Time Domain Electromagnetic ("TDEM") survey flown over the Cacuilo River valley and its main tributaries, where Lucapa and its partners have identified extensive alluvial diamond deposits.
 
The SkyTEM 304M survey was flown between February and April 2017 in one block comprising 8,566km of flight lines.
 
The lines were spaced at a nominal 100m, flown in a north-south direction, with tie lines at 1,000m intervals flown in an east-west direction at a nominal terrain clearance of 30m. Electromagnetic ("EM") and magnetic data was collected along with terrain elevation.
 
The TDEM survey completes the air-borne geophysical tools to be used by the Lulo partners to guide and update the ongoing kimberlite drilling program by identifying new non (or low) magnetic targets and to provide further definition of magnetic targets previously identified from aeromagnetic surveys flown over the entire 3,000km2  Lulo concession by Fugro Airborne Surveys in 2008 and 2013.
 
11 New EM Targets Identified
The TDEM results identified 11 new kimberlite targets within the Cacuilo River valley area demonstrating conductive EM signatures (Figures 1-3) with little or no discernible magnetic signatures. These new mapped targets range in size up to 150 hectares.
 
Of the 11 new targets, five (G549, G550, G551, G552 and G553) are located along drainage systems feeding into the Mining Block 8 area (Figure 2), which has been a regular source of large and premium-value, irregular shaped and jagged edged alluvial diamonds.
 
Another three of the new EM targets (G556, G558 and G559) are located further south-east along the Cacuilo River near the L165-L170 kimberlite area (Figures 1 and 2). This region was previously highlighted as an area of exploration interest due to favourable mineral chemistry results, including a micro-diamond and G10 garnets (See ASX announcement 21 December 2015).
 
 
Reclassification of Existing Kimberlite Targets
Analysis of the TDEM data and the re-interpretation of existing magnetic data highlighted 34 priority one kimberlite targets within the Cacuilo Valley area (Figure 3).
 
These targets all demonstrated strongly conductive EM signatures, supporting the existence of favourable near-surface pyroclastic kimberlite ("PK") material associated with kimberlite pipes. Many of these priority one targets are also located along topographical drainage systems feeding into the Mining Block 8 area and the L165-L170 area of interest to the south-east.
 
Apart from the strength of their EM signatures, the priority one kimberlite targets are also predominantly large (>10ha), ranging in size up to 150ha.
 
 
A further 28 EM/magnetic kimberlite targets were classified as priority two and three.
 
These targets are in addition to the seven kimberlites (L13, L14, L15, L18, L171, L242 and L252 - Figure 3) from which drill core has already been dispatched to Cape Town for laboratory analysis (See ASX announcement 18 July 2017). 
 
Next Steps - Systematic Drilling, Laboratory Analysis and Bulk Sampling
The TDEM results have enabled the Lulo geological team to update the ongoing kimberlite drilling program. While three drilling rigs are currently available, the Lulo partners will consider allocating additional resources to this program. 
 
Kimberlite drilling will continue at Lulo for the remainder of 2017 with the aim of extracting core from the priority targets identified from the TDEM results. This systematic drilling program will also include a planned deep hole at the L259 target (Figure 3), when ground conditions permit. 
 
The core from this ongoing drilling program will be dispatched to Cape Town for laboratory analysis periodically throughout the program.
 
As detailed in the ASX announcement of 18 July 2017, the laboratory analysis process involves crushing the drill core and extracting kimberlite indicator minerals (including garnet, ilmenite, chrome spinel, chrome diopside and zircon) from heavy liquid concentrates. These indicator minerals are then analysed using an electron microprobe to determine their mineral chemistry.
 
The mineral chemistry results are in turn used to prioritise likely diamondiferous kimberlite pipes for follow up geological work, including further drilling and bulk sampling to test for diamond content and grade. Future kimberlite bulk sampling programs will have to include processing of large tonnages to get meaningful data as a result of the low-grade, high-value nature of the Lulo diamond resource.
 
As previously advised, the Lulo partners expect to receive the results during the September 2017 Quarter from the first batch of kimberlite samples undergoing laboratory analysis in Cape Town.
 
Alluvial Channels 
Apart from defining kimberlite targets, the TDEM survey was also used to identify shallow conductive horizons along the Cacuilo River associated with alluvial channels. These areas will be tested using the Sedidrill rig to determine the presence of potential diamond-bearing gravel.
 
Funding in Place
As previously advised, Lucapa will fund the kimberlite drilling program from the Company's share of pro-rata distributions from the Lulo alluvial mining operations. This includes the US$1.6 million distribution million declared in May 2017.
 
For an on behalf of the Lucapa Board.
 
STEPHEN WETHERALL
MANAGING DIRECTOR
 
ABOUT LUCAPA        
Lucapa Diamond Company Limited is a growing diamond company with a portfolio of high-quality production, development and exploration assets in Angola, Lesotho, Botswana and Australia. The Company's focus on high-value production is designed to protect cash flows as pricing in this sector of the diamond market remains robust.
 
Lucapa's flagship asset is the Lulo Diamond Project in Angola, which produced the highest $ per carat price of any run of mine diamond production in the world in 2016 and continues to produce some of the largest diamonds on record from that region. Lucapa and its Lulo partners are also well-advanced in their search for the primary source of these large and premium-value alluvial diamonds, with three rigs now available to drill priority kimberlite targets.
 
In keeping with the Company's growth strategy, Lucapa has secured a 70% interest in the advanced, high-quality Mothae kimberlite project in Lesotho, which is located in the heart of the world's highest-value cluster of kimberlite mines. Lucapa plans to commence production at Mothae in 2018.
 
Lucapa has also defined drilling targets at two earlier-stage diamond projects - Orapa Area F in Botswana's Orapa diamond field and Brooking in the West Kimberley lamproite province in Western Australia.
 
Lucapa's Board and management team have extensive diamond industry experience with companies including De Beers, Rio Tinto and Gem Diamonds. The Company was included in the ASX All Ordinaries Index in March 2017. 
 
Lucapa is also advancing a dual listing on London's AIM market.

JORC Code, 2012 Edition - Table 1
Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.)




Criteria


JORC Code explanation


Commentary






Sampling techniques


·    Nature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.
·    Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.
·    Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.
·    In cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.


·    No drilling and sampling results are applicable to this report, these are geophysical results only.




Drilling techniques


·    Drill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).


·    No drilling applies to this report.




Drill sample recovery


·    Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.
·    Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.
·    Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.


·    Drill sample recovery is not applicable to this report.




Logging


·    Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.
·    Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.
·    The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.


·    Core and chip samples are not applicable to this report.

Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation


·    If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.
·    If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.
·    For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.
·    Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.

·    Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.


·    Sub-sampling and sample preparation are not applicable to geophysical prospecting.




Quality of assay data and laboratory tests


·    The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.
·    For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.
·    Nature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.


·    There is no assay data, only geophysical data.
·    SkyTEM304 is a helicopter carried geophysical survey system.
·    The airborne instrumentation comprising a SkyTEM 304M  system includes a time domain electromagnetic system, a magnetic data acquisition system and an auxiliary data acquisition system containing two inclinometers, two altimeters and three DGPS'.
·    All instruments are mounted on the frame suspended ~40 m below the helicopter, the generator used to power the transmitter is suspended between the frame and the helicopter, ~20 m below the helicopter.

·    Whether sample compositing has been applied.


·    The nominal terrain clearance was 30 m, the nominal production airspeed is 120-150 kph for a flat topography with no wind.
·    The survey is comprised of one block containing 8566.3 km planned flight lines.
·    Data spacing is tabulated below.
 
 
 




Orientation of data in relation to geological structure


·    Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.
·    If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.


·      This is an aerial survey.




Sample security


·    The measures taken to ensure sample security.


·      The complete dataset of the SkyTEM survey is delivered as a Geosoft database (GDB) which can be used as input for further processing and gridding and as input to inversion and interpretation software. The result of the Surface constrained inversion (SCI) is delivered as a Geosoft database (GDB) containing the modelled layer conductivity's.




Audits or reviews


·    The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.


·      An independent contractor, GRS Consulting has reviewed the survey outcome and interpretation independently of LOM.




 
Section 2 Reporting of Exploration Results
(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section.)
 




Criteria


JORC Code explanation


Commentary






Mineral tenement and land tenure status


·    Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings.
·    The security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.


·      The 1994 legislation covering the Angolan diamond industry stipulates that only Endiama (Empresa Nacional de Diamantes de Angola, the State Diamond Company) or joint ventures with Endiama, can hold diamond mining rights awarded by the Council of Ministers. 
·      Under the terms of the Lulo Joint Venture Association Agreements, separate titles are granted for alluvial and kimberlite mining and exploration. The exploration for both alluvials and kimberlites on the Lulo Concession is a requirement under the Act. 
·      In May 2014, the authorization for the kimberlite exploration and mining was gazetted and equity distribution in this was Endiama 51%, Lucapa Diamond Company Ltd 39%*, Rosas e Petalas S.A.  19%.
·      An application to extend Kimberlite Exploration Licence after 25 May 2016 was submitted and approved by the Angolan Ministry of Mines.
·      The equity distribution in the new kimberlite exploration JV is being negotiated.




Exploration done by other parties


·    Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.


·      Limited exploration has been undertaken by state controlled entities. 
·      Parts of the area have been exploited by artisanal miners - no records of this work are available. 




Geology


·    Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.


·      Significant diamond bearing alluvial systems, of Mesozoic to Recent ages overlie a major, but relatively poorly exposed, kimberlite field. The kimberlite pipes intrude flat-lying Proterozoic and Karoo age sediments within the Lucapa Graben. 
·      The kimberlite field is the source of the alluvial diamonds




Drill hole Information


·    A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:
o easting and northing of the drill hole collar
o elevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar
o dip and azimuth of the hole
o down hole length and interception depth
o hole length.
·    If the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.


·      No drill hole information applies to this report.




Data aggregation methods


·    In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.
·    Where aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high grade results and longer lengths of low grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.
·    The assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.


·      Data aggregation methods of this type are not applicable to geophysical prospecting.




Relationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths


·    These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.
·    If the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.
·    If it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known').


·      This is not an applicable concept in geophysical prospecting.




Diagrams


·    Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.


·      Diagrams are included in the main text of this report. 




Balanced reporting


·    Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.


·      All results are reported.




Other substantive exploration data


·    Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.


·      Other material substantive exploration data has been reported.




Further work


·    The nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).
·    Diagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.


·      Drill testing of new targets. Ground truthing of new targets using both geophysical techniques and auger/scout drilling.

INTRODUCTION
Lucapa Diamond Company Limited (ASX: LOM) ("Lucapa" or "the Company") is a growing diamond company with a portfolio of high-quality production, development and exploration assets in Angola, Lesotho, Botswana and Australia.
 
Lucapa's flagship asset is the Lulo Diamond Project ("Lulo") - a 3,000km2 concession in Angola's Lunda Norte diamond heartland. Lucapa operates Lulo in partnership with Empresa Nacional da Diamantes E.P. ("Endiama") and Rosas & Petalas.
 
Lulo, through mining company Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo ("SML"), generates strong cash flows mining large and premium-value alluvial diamonds. Lulo has produced Angola's two biggest diamonds on record, weighing 404 carats and 227 carats.
 
Lucapa and its partners are also advancing their search for the primary kimberlite sources of the exceptional alluvial diamonds, with three rigs available for drilling priority kimberlite targets at Lulo.
 
To complement the high-value production from Lulo, Lucapa successfully bid for, and acquired, a 70% interest in the advanced, high-quality Mothae kimberlite project in Lesotho.
 
Mothae is similar to Lulo in that it is known to contain large and premium-value diamonds. It is situated in the heart of the highest $ per carat cluster of kimberlite diamond producing mines in the world, within 5km of Letšeng, the world's highest $ per carat kimberlite diamond mine.
 
Lucapa has also identified drilling targets at its two earlier-stage exploration projects - Orapa Area F in Botswana's prolific Orapa diamond field and Brooking in the West Kimberley lamproite province in Western Australia.
Lucapa has a primary listing on the ASX and was included in the All Ordinaries Index on 20 March 2017. Lucapa has engaged Panmure Gordon & Co as its UK advisers and is advancing plans to dual list on London's AIM market. 
 
ALLUVIAL DIAMOND MINING
Lulo alluvial diamond mining company, SML (Lucapa 40% owner and operator), produced 4,203 carats of diamonds during the Quarter, an increase of 63% on the previous corresponding period (Table 1).
 
Lulo continued to regularly produce large and premium-value diamonds during the Quarter, with the number of Special diamonds recovered up 97% to 57. The total weight of Specials produced during the Quarter was up 76% to 1,199 carats. These Specials included two +50 carat diamonds.
 
The diamond production increases were generated from a 55% rise in mining volumes to 57,283 bulk cubic metres ("bcm"), leaving SML on track to achieve record and targeted annual production of 240,000 bcm for calendar 2017.
 
The grade of the diamonds recovered during the Quarter improved 5% to 7.3 carats per 100 cubic metres, while the average size of the diamonds recovered was steady at 1.3 carats.
 
Mining operations in April and May 2017 were focused primarily on Mining Block 28, with access to the higher-value Mining Blocks 8 and 6 available in June 2017 as ground conditions improved following the end of the Angolan wet season.

Table 2: Lulo diamond sales and average prices for the Quarter and comparative periods
 
ALLUVIAL EXPLORATION
 
Mining and exploration activities at Lulo have been focused on the Cacuilo River valley area, which runs for more than 50km through the south west of the Lulo concession.
 
During the Quarter, the Lulo partners conducted their first exploration along the Lulo River, which is within the awarded 1,500km2 Mining Licence area. This is with the aim of establishing economic resource areas along the much larger and longer Lulo River to add to the current inferred alluvial JORC resource. 
 
This involved constructing a ~30km road north-east from the Cacuilo River mining operations to the Lulo River to enable the mobile Sedidrill rig to access this area.
 
The Sedidrill was successful in recovering alluvial gravels. Further drilling is being planned to define sufficient gravels for a bulk sample to test for diamond content, quality and grade.
 
KIMBERLITE EXPLORATION
 
The Lulo kimberlite exploration program is designed to locate the primary hard-rock source(s) of the exceptional quality and value alluvial diamonds being mined along the Cacuilo River valley area within the 3,000km2 Lulo concession.
 
Exploration has historically been focused on magnetic targets identified from previous air-borne aeromagnetic surveys in the alluvial areas where large and premium-value diamonds have been recovered and where there is also supporting geological evidence of proximal kimberlite pipes.
 
In April 2017, the new Hanjin D&B drilling rig was commissioned at Lulo after being shipped to Angola from Korea. This increased to three the number of rigs available for drilling during the Quarter to further the kimberlite exploration program.
 
During the Quarter, an 8,566 line km helicopter-borne Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) survey was completed over the Cacuilo River valley area. The analysis and interpretation of this data is in the final stage, with the results imminent.
 
 
The TDEM survey was designed to guide and update the Lulo kimberlite drilling program by identifying other possible non-magnetic kimberlites (through identifying new anomalies with EM conductive signatures) as well as to provide further definition of known targets identified from the earlier aeromagnetic surveys.
 
In addition, the TDEM survey data would also be used to locate alluvium channels that could assist in mapping new alluvial diamond deposits along the Cacuilo River.
 
As announced to the ASX on 30 May 2017, preliminary analysis of the TDEM data resulted in the discovery of the coarse, near-surface L14 kimberlite, located ~2km upstream of Mining Block 8.
 
Core from L14 was included in the first batch of kimberlite drill core samples dispatched during the Quarter for laboratory analysis in Cape Town, South Africa. This batch also included coarse kimberlite core samples from L13, L15, L18, L171, L242 and L252.
 
The laboratory analysis process involves crushing the drill core and extracting kimberlite indicator minerals (including garnet, ilmenite, chrome spinel, chrome diopside and zircon) from heavy liquid concentrates. These indicator minerals are then analysed using an electron microprobe to determine their mineral chemistry.
 
The mineral chemistry results are used to prioritise kimberlites for follow up work, including further drilling and bulk sampling. The first results from the kimberlite samples currently undergoing laboratory analysis in Cape Town are expected in the September 2017 quarter.
 
 
 
 
MOTHAE KIMBERLITE PROJECT, LESOTHO 
 
During the previous quarter, Lucapa acquired a 70% interest in the advanced, high-value Mothae kimberlite project. This followed an international tender process run by the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, who has retained a 30% interest.
 
Mothae is considered complementary to Lulo in that both resources are known to host large and premium-value diamonds, a sector of the diamond industry that has seen pricing remain robust. Mothae is located at the heart of the highest-price cluster of kimberlite mines in the world and within 5km of London-listed Gem Diamonds' Letseng mine, the world's highest $ per carat kimberlite diamond mine.
 
Lucapa notes the recent announcement by Gem Diamonds on July 6 of the recovery of a 126 carat D-colour Type IIa gem from Letseng, which closely followed two +100 carat diamond recoveries in June 2017.
 
The high-value nature of the Mothae resource is also reflected in the independent JORC resource estimate of more than 1 million carats of diamonds at a modelled average diamond value of US$1,063 per carat (at a 2mm bottom cut-off size) - this is the second highest average price per carat of any kimberlite resource in the world. While the JORC classified resource has been estimated to a depth of 300m, independent modelling of the Mothae kimberlite pipe extends to 500m (See ASX announcement 24 March 20171).
 
Under the Phase 1 development plan, Lucapa plans to process ~2 million tonnes of mainly weathered, near-surface kimberlite material at 720,000 tonnes per annum over the first three years. This material is primarily free-dig, which means it will require limited drilling and blasting.  Lucapa will commence detailed studies for the Phase 2 development plan for Mothae once Phase 1 is fully commissioned.
 
Lucapa is able to fast-track mine development at Mothae because the 8.8 hectare kimberlite pipe has already been well defined through drilling and trial mining. The trial mining produced more than 23,000 carats of diamonds, which included individual stones of up to 254 carats and Type IIa gems. These diamonds were sold for ~US$17m, with individual stones achieving prices of up to US$41,500 per carat.
 
In developing Mothae within the next 12 months, Lucapa will also leverage off the significant operating experience its Board and management team have in Lesotho, including at the neighbouring Letseng and Kao mines.
 
 
1 The Company confirms that it is not aware of any new information or data that materially affects the information included in the original market announcement and that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the Mothae resource estimate in the relevant market announcement continue to apply and have not materially changed.  The Company confirms that the form and context in which the Competent Person's findings are presented have not been materially modified from the original market announcement.
During the Quarter, Lucapa undertook multiple work streams to advance its Phase 1 development plan for Mothae. These included:
·     Optimising mine planning and plant throughput modelling
·     Updating the financial and production modelling to determine optimisation impact on project economics
·     Environmental audit and approval applications
·     Commenced the tendering process for large contracts and contractors
·     Development infrastructure planning, including plant, slimes and fresh water dam locations
·     Commencement of earth works and upgrading of accommodation units
·     Strengthening the technical management team
 
ORAPA AREA F, BOTSWANA
 
Lucapa's Orapa Area F Project is located ~40km east of the prolific Orapa diamond mine in Botswana. Previous exploration work carried out by Lucapa was successful in defining a double-lobed coincident gravity/magnetic feature at the AN01 anomaly, measuring approximately 350m x 150m.
 
During the Quarter, Lucapa commenced the environmental approval process to drill AN01. A drilling contract is being finalised, with drilling of the AN01 anomaly expected to commence during the current September 2017 quarter.
 
BROOKING DIAMOND PROJECT, WESTERN AUSTRALIA
 
Lucapa's Brooking Diamond Project is located within 40km of the Ellendale diamond field in Western Australia's Kimberley district, which was formerly the world's leading producer of rare, fancy yellow diamonds.
 
Previous exploration work carried out by Lucapa identified a series of well-defined conductors at Brooking potentially associated with lamproite, a host rock for diamonds.
 
During the Quarter, Lucapa commenced planning for a heritage survey over the areas at Brooking where drilling is planned. This survey is expected to be completed soon, enabling drilling to commence later in the September 2017 quarter.
 
CORPORATE
 
Lucapa Cash Balance
 
At 30 June 2017, Lucapa held cash reserves of US$7.8m (A$10.2m). In addition, Lulo mining company SML (Lucapa 40% owner and operator) held cash of US$8.5 million at 30 June 2017.
 
Lucapa's cash balance included US$2.5m in Lulo loan repayments repatriated from Angola during the Quarter.  The repatriation process for the final US$1.5m portion of the loan repayment due to Lucapa is expected to be completed this quarter.
 
Lucapa's US$7.8m cash balance does not include the US$1.6m distribution paid to the Company in the previous quarter (See ASX announcement 8 March 2017). As previously advised, Lucapa will repatriate its capital loan repayments from Lulo mining company SML but will set aside and leave in Angola its 40% share of the alluvial distributions declared to the SML partners to fund the ongoing Lulo kimberlite exploration program.
 
During the Quarter, Lucapa received US$0.7m in proceeds from the conversion of 3,523,030 unlisted A$0.30 options by directors and management. The remaining unlisted A$0.30 options expired on 24 April 2017 and      28 May 2017.
 
Mothae Funding Package
 
On 26 May 2017, Lucapa announced a funding package of up to US$14.5m (A$19m) to fund the acquisition of Mothae and to advance the Phase 1 development plan.
 
This funding (See ASX announcement 26 May 2017) comprised:
 
·     A$9.2m underwriting agreement with Westar Capital Ltd for the 46.2m listed A$0.20 options (ASX: LOMOA) due to expire on 30 September 2017;
 
·     A$5.5m six-month bridging loan facility with First Class Securities Ltd; and
 
·     The issue to Westar of 11.6m unlisted A$0.35 fee options expiring twelve months from the date of issue (Expected to be around 30 September 2017). If exercised, these fee options will generate additional cash proceeds of up to A$4.1m for Lucapa.
 
Under the staged payment timetable for the US$9m consideration for Mothae, Lucapa originally scheduled to make the second US$4.1m payment to the Government of Lesotho during the Quarter. However, in agreement with the Government, this payment was deferred until after the country's national general elections, which were held in early June 2017.
 
With the elections now concluded, the new Government and new Ministers sworn in, the Government of Lesotho and Lucapa are meeting in Lesotho shortly to conclude the payment formalities. Lucapa will pay the Government of Lesotho the US$4.1m second payment in July 2017 and commence the monthly payments of US$560,000 over the following eight months to complete the US$9 million consideration.
 
AIM Listing
 
In 2016, Lucapa appointed London firm Panmure Gordon & Co as its UK advisers as part of plans to consider a dual listing on London's AIM market.
 
Lucapa continues to visit London to present to UK institutional investors and funds to promote Lucapa and outline the Company's development plans for Lulo and the high-value Mothae kimberlite.
 
The positive feedback from these road shows has prompted Lucapa to commit to plans for a dual listing on London's AIM market. As a result, preparations for the AIM listing are being advanced, with Lucapa shares expected to be trading on the AIM market in the December 2017 quarter.
 
Lucapa believes that the AIM listing will help the Company achieve its objective of attracting institutional and cornerstone investors to its share register.
 
Brooking Consideration
 
During the Quarter, Lucapa issued 250,000 fully paid ordinary shares and 500,000 unlisted A$0.53 options, expiring 15 May 2019, to Leopold Diamond Company Ltd for an 80% interest in the Brooking Diamond Project tenements, as set out in the ASX announcement of 13 October 2016.
 
Orapa Consideration
 
During the Quarter, Lucapa issued 165,000 unlisted A$0.45 options expiring 24 May 2020, subject to vesting conditions, as consideration for the 25% interest in the Orapa Area F Project not already owned by Lucapa.
 
For and on behalf of the Lucapa Board.

Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
