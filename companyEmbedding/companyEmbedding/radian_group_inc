Radian isn’t new to the Food industry. For over 18 years, Radian has transformed Food Processor, Manufacturer, Retail, and Food Service firms into more effective, profitable, and competitive companies.

Founded in 1996, Radian initially focused on optimizing complex food supply chain and logistics processes between food retailers and their suppliers. As our customer base grew, we expanded our practitioner-led approach into the demand side of the supply chain: retailer and food service category management and planning. Subsequently, we invested substantially in analytics and planning tools, recruited top industry talent, and began changing how retailers and suppliers drive their business performance. This formed the basis for Radian’s Results Based Planning (RBP).

In 2008, a number of our retail customers asked that we lead the design and implementation of some in-market and in-store initiatives, and thus, Radian Activate was created. Greater expectations about merchandising and customer marketing investments require a more thoughtful approach, deeper expertise, and a culture of selling and consumer engagement. “Demos” simply don't work anymore.

Since our inception, we have continually grown our revenue, size, and capabilities. But more importantly, we have grown our customers’ businesses. We take pride in our consistent performance and our industry-leading client list.

All along the way, our Associates have grown with us—in number and in expertise. Exciting clients, interesting and challenging work, a healthy work-life balance, and the opportunity to “stretch their entrepreneurial legs” make Radian a great place to be.

Where do we go from here? Our current focus is on developing new approaches to information management, planning and analytics, linking to in-market and in-store execution, and creating outsourced merchandising process management solutions.

We see a much more competitive and dynamic future for the Food and Retail channels. Challenging? Certainly; agility and innovative thinking are required to navigate what lies ahead. But these are the moments where the best opportunities can emerge.

We hope we can be part of your future.

Radian works with its Retailer, Foodservice Distributor, and Supplier clients to align the elements of RBP that best match their business needs. We don't believe in a “one size fits all” approach. We begin by identifying areas of common ground. For example:


What are the in-market challenges a supplier’s brand faces?
How can a retail banner improve and differentiate the store experience?
How can promotional spend be allocated in way that drives category share and menu penetration?

Retailers, Foodservice Distributors, and their Supplier Partners participate in early phases of our unique approach, then rely on our expertise to plan, execute, and measure.

Building a more collaborative relationship between suppliers and retailers begins with a better understanding of each other’s business objectives and marketplace dynamics. Once you’ve established trust and alignment, then you can develop and implement plans that fully leverage every stakeholder’s marketing dollar. At Radian, we understand both sides of the table, and our process helps balance the retailer/supplier equation. 



“We need help building our internal teams capabilities in category business planning and execution in terms of processes and tools.”

	Radian will customize our processes, tools, analyses, and deliverables to meet the retailers’ specific needs and baseline capabilities. We will train the retailer’s category management and sourcing teams on the new processes and go through a planning cycle to ensure effective implementation.


“I need better integration of my suppliers into my planning and execution - we aren't leveraging our suppliers as well as we should.”

	Radian works with suppliers to extend our (or the retailers) category business planning to key suppliers. This includes supplier 'summit' meetings, common category measures and analytics, and initiative planning and execution. 


“We need to do a better job on promotion planning and execution - we're not getting the best ROI on our promotional investments.” 

	Radian assists the retailer in developing the most effective promotion planning structure and process. Radian will then customize our Promotion Analytics toolset to support the process (analytics, elasticity, sales / volume / margin optimization, etc.). 




“Our investments in shopper, basket, and consumer research aren't translating to practical action at the shelf level.”

	Radian translates the retailer’s shopper information and analytics into department, category, and product plans. Working with the merchandising teams, Radian creates and prioritizes initiatives and implementation plans.



"I need a better competitive strategy against other channel players."

	Radian develops effective retailer strategies including competitive position, channel expansion, format strategies, store space allocation, shopper segmentation targeting, and store cluster development.



“Our category plans seem good, but they are not effectively implemented.”

	Radian develops and implements category plans across retailer operations, supply chain, Marketing, and participating suppliers. Radian also provides initiative measurement processes and tools to ensure effective execution and oversight.

The Merger
“This category plan provided significant benefits for our customers and the bottom line.  We were particularly impressed with the depth of the merchandising plan and the ability to communicate the complete story in a clear and concise way - including the financial impacts.”

		Challenge

The merger of two large retailers required a new, integrated approach to category business planning that addressed both the commonalities and differences in the divisions in terms of customer needs and retailer processes capabilities.


		Solution 

Radian led a nine-week category planning process for Packaged Salads, the client’s top Produce category, integrating input from the recently merged divisions and multiple suppliers.  Radian provided assortment optimization processes and tools, promotional effectiveness recommendations, price elasticity modeling, category financial projections and overall project management support.


		Project Impact

The implementation of the category plan resolved product gaps in each division’s assortment, promotional frequencies, product bundling and promotional depth, and adjusted value pricing to drive sales and margin growth.  Results were substantial:  sales growth rates over 7% year- over- year and a 3.3% improvement in margin.
 



Declining Sales
“I worked with Radian at a previous retailer and knew that they could help our organization work more closely with our strategic supplier partners to develop innovative and successful initiatives that benefit both the retailer and the supplier.”

Challenge

Sales were declining in a number of fresh categories with no substantial changes in pricing or promotion over the last two quarters. The organization needed some innovative ideas and a better way to measure the impacts of merchandising changes. We selected the fresh chicken category due to an 8% sales decline and the relative consumer importance for meal preparation.



Solution 

Radian developed comprehensive category analytics and scorecards that exposed the most significant problems for chicken in a single product segment with declining promotional lifts. Radian leveraged our price elasticity tools to develop a new long-term TPR price plan with the appropriate promotional program changes in depth and frequency.  Total category sales elasticity analysis exposed potential substitute items where price adjustments were needed to minimize cannibalization and maximize overall category results. Radian worked with the strategic vendor to align the vendor funding to the new promotional and pricing strategies.



Project Impact

This new pricing strategy was implemented and drove a 10% improvement in sales dollars and a 15% improvement in margin for the retailer.  At the same time, the strategic supplier saw a 7% increase in units creating a substantial win for this new collaboration model.

 



Promo Planning
“We leveraged Radian’s expertise in promotion optimization to drive real benefits.  Radian enhanced their promotion optimization tool set to work within and across our information systems, saving us time and money.  This allowed us to get benefits much faster than other potential solutions.”

Challenge

Lack of a robust promotional planning process, appropriately defined financial controls and the ability to optimize promotional prices for a regional retailer, was causing an inefficient use of promotional investment and significant margin pressure.



Solution 

Radian implemented a promotional planning process with formalized roles and responsibilities throughout the organization and spanned annual, quarterly, period and weekly planning horizons.  In addition, Radian utilized its 3P OptimizerTM software to provide promotional price recommendations for all potential weekly ad and TPR promotions, optimizing sales and profitability financial metrics.  Radian’s 3PO analytics and optimization process considers past and planned deal information and historical sales and margin data to develop more effective promotion plans.



Project Impact

The implementation of the new promotional planning process, underpinned with more rigid financial controls, and the extensive use of the item-level price optimization resulted in a 200 basis point reduction in the overall promotional investment rate, leading to a significant improvement in margin rate and net margin dollars.

 



Integrated Strategy
“Radian has been a great partner in re-architecting our merchandising vision and establishing core business process and planning capabilities. Their expertise in food retailing and their analytically-driven approach to support my teams – from strategic planning through implementation -- has resulted in significant, measureable sales and margin benefits.”

		Challenge

Sales declines during the recession created significant challenges for this retailer as they had no formal category business planning process and needed to adjust to the new consumer requirements and expectations.


		Solution 

Radian established a formal category planning process and supported an accelerated approach for critical categories (in addition to long-term staff training and support). Radian developed and utilized store clustering to customize the assortment and adjust the plan-o-gram for improved shopping ease of their quality tiers and brands. This assortment ‘overhaul’ was integrated with a comprehensive category pricing and promotional strategy.


		Project Impact

For the coffee category, the team developed new own brand products to add lower price point expectations.  Key growth categories were expanded including single cup, ethnic, and organic products.  Along with pricing and promotion changes, this resulted in a 12% improvement in sales and eliminated the gap to the market trend while increasing the net margin trend by over 28%.

	I chose to work at Radian because I had a dream of doing consulting, helping other people. I had grown tired of delivering information with a bias towards selling product. I wanted to have an impact on business.

	What do you most enjoy about what you do?

	I enjoy finding the needle in the haystack and connecting the dots. I love presenting: capturing the room and getting others to a level of understanding.

	What are your passions outside of work?

	I love my family: my wife of 21 years, Regina, and my three daughters, Renae, Jasmine, and Julia. I am a sports fanatic so I will usually turn the conversation with something like, "Did you see the game last night?" or, "Who are your top five power forwards, all-time?” Putting it all together, I enjoy sitting with my wife watching my kids play a slew of sports except basketball, my first true love.

	What advice would you give new hires?

	Go beyond for the benefit of your client - make life easier for them and they will trust you. Challenge yourself to find areas where we can improve and innovate - think about what the client needs. You don't add value unless something gets implemented - fancy presentations and analytics without action is dead. 

	What has been your favorite moment at Radian?

	It is hard to pinpoint one moment. It's really been about the journey: my growth as a businessperson and my approach to the challenges that I face.

	Why did you choose Radian?

	One of the primary reasons I joined Radian is that I aspired to be part of a company that would leverage my more than 20 years of industry experience to influence change. Radian has been the perfect fit and continues to leverage my previous experience while strengthening my industry knowledge and business management skills even more.

	What do you most enjoy about what you do?

I enjoy the culture that Radian has developed and how it applies directly to our approach with our clients. This empowers all of us to leverage our strengths and challenges us in new areas of growth.       

	What are your passions outside of work?

My hobbies evolve around being outdoors as much as I can and include travel, camping, golf and photography.          

	What advice would you give new hires?

	Be open minded and ready to leverage your knowledge and experience within a team-led environment. Get ready to be challenged each and everyday!

	What has been your favorite moment at Radian?

	My favorite moment was after about six months of joining Radian, when I began to see our client’s performance be driven by the work I was part of developing and implementing.  At this point, I knew I had joined the company that best fit my interests and future career path.

	Why did you choose Radian?

	Radian gave me the ability to be a part of a terrific, diverse team of professionals and to use my experience and skills to drive change and results with our clients.

	What do you most enjoy about what you do?

	Gaining the respect and trust of the clients. I enjoy becoming a trusted advisor and resource.

	What are your passions outside of work?

	Family. My six-year old daughter keeps me busy when I am home.  We also love the outdoors, camping and fishing in the summer, and skiing in the winter.

	What advice would you give new hires?

	Forge relationships within the firm. Because of the diversity of backgrounds and experience within Radian, there are so many excellent opportunities to grow professionally through these interactions.

	What has been your favorite moment at Radian?

	There are so many that can't be put down on permanent record (based on the advice of my attorney). My real answer: Every time we have a new engagement with a client, I reach that point where I realize the client sees us as a critical part of their team. That is job satisfaction.

Senior Director










Kristin Caffey
Senior Director





	Why did you choose Radian?

	First and foremost, I was attracted to the work. It's challenging and interesting; you're always learning something! Outside of wanting to get experience within a smaller company, the balance I can have between my personal and professional life really resonated with me. I am very passionate about my work and will always give 110%, but my life outside of work is equally important.   

	What do you most enjoy about what you do?

	I enjoy helping people connect the dots. The moment you see the clients “get it” and their eyes light up makes all the data mining worth it. It's rewarding to see them excited and learning.        

	What are your passions outside of work?

	I enjoy being active outdoors, doing yoga, shopping and, most importantly, spending time with my family!           

	What advice would you give new hires?

	My advice would be to take time to get to know the team and build relationships early. 

	What has been your favorite moment at Radian?

	It's hard to isolate one memory. I've really enjoyed the people, the work and the opportunity to grow as an individual.

Ambuj Agarwal
Senior Analyst










Ambuj Agarwal
Senior Analyst





	Why did you choose Radian?

	Choosing Radian was a much easier decision than I thought. I came to know about Radian through Roger, who is a Longhorn, and we entered into conversation about possibilities. When I interviewed with Radian, I got a chance to meet the people and that removed any doubts in my mind. I was looking for a dynamic, independent and a fun work environment where everyone works with each other. I got exactly that at Radian.

	What do you most enjoy about what you do?

	The thing I enjoy the most is the freedom I have been given at the work place. I am in charge of my own workload and I pace it as fast as I can manage. With the exceptional variety in projects available, I am sometimes spoiled for choice and that keeps me motivated.

	What are your passions outside of work?

	Fortunately (or unfortunately) I am not passionate about any thing in particular outside of work. I like to try a lot of different things and that leaves me doing something new every weekend. When I did not know Nashville, I thought it was boring; now I can hardly stop talking about Nashville.

	What advice would you give new hires?

	At Radian, the only thing I would advise newcomers is to remain honest. If you don't feel up to a task, there will be people ready to help you through difficult situations. However, it can only happen if one is open and honest about it. Radian colleagues provide a perfect environment to feel comfortable doing so.

	What has been your favorite moment at Radian?

	It has to be when I realized I was a part of building a complete Pricing Process from scratch for a client. It gave me a sense of deeply-rooted satisfaction. It was not until I realized that we achieved the goal that this feeling truly sank in. Not only was I part of the process, I was given a lot of latitude to build it from the ground up.

Tim Smith
Analyst










Tim Smith
Analyst





	Why did you choose Radian?

	I interned at Radian the summer between my junior and senior year of college and loved the culture of the company. The work that Radian does is very impactful and I wanted a career where I could make a difference. After graduating, Radian was the first company I contacted to start my career.

	What do you most enjoy about what you do?

	I really enjoy being involved in multiple projects at the same time. My workdays are never the same, so I'm constantly being challenged to think and act quickly. Being a part of implementing new programs and tracking their success is also very fulfilling.

	What are your passions outside of work?

	I really enjoy traveling around the world and experiencing new cultures. I also enjoy being active by running, cycling, participating in multiple team sports and getting involved in races.

	What advice would you give new hires?

	My advice to a new hire would be to find an area in the company that you feel needs improvement and spend time outside of the office working on that. Everyone at Radian has a purpose and they all strive to be the best at what they do. 

	What has been your favorite moment at Radian?

	My favorite moment at Radian was when we had a relay race around Lake Calhoun with several people from the office. Chris got everyone involved and it was a really nice way to take a little break that afternoon. Of course, we analyzed the results afterwards—which was almost as fun.

	Supply Chain & Inventory Management


Supply Chain & Inventory ManagementManage Your Supply ChainMany initiatives and event programs become mobile, moving from store-to-store and market-to-market each week and require additional product than stores or distribution centers normally carry on-hand. We understand all of the moving parts to make an event successfully operate each and every time and will ensure that your Operations, Store, and Sales teams have little to worry about.
Gain Turn Key TransportationRadian Activate can work directly with your internal Transportation team—or provide transportation services for the initiative or event fixtures and assets, working with your stores to deliver equipment in a timely and efficient manner.
Manage Product and InventoryRadian manages large-scale, complex inventory management processes for many of our customers. We take VMI to the next level through innovative analytics and planning tools, experienced planning team members. and rigorous communication with all participants. Our team will engage Suppliers and Replenishment teams for each program to build proper product allocations and assess inventory positions in real time. In addition, we will work with appropriate Merchant and Pricing teams to align on pricing and PLU management for all products. Many of our supplier partners see exceptional value with the introduction of new items, where Radian ensures speed-to-shelf and distribution objectives are met.


	Customer Loyalty Programs


Customer Loyalty Programs
Complement Loyalty Programs with In-store Events and Sales InitiativesRetailers with Loyalty Programs can offer continuity benefits in a variety of ways to help keep your customers engaged and anticipate their needs—before, during, and after a sale or an event.
Balance Communication and PromotionCustomers often complain when they receive too much communication from retailers or brands. Radian Activate works with your Marketing and Customer Insights teams to strike the right balance between communicating valuable information and offering targeted promotions to further enhance your goals and initiatives.


	In Market Research & Analysis


In Market Research & Analysis
Understand Consumer and Shopper BehaviorsCustomer shopping and meal occasion habits and patterns are always being challenged by retailer, operator, and supplier campaigns. Radian Activate will work with your Customer Insights and Marketing team to determine what matters most to your consumers.
Create Opportunities to Draw and Retain CustomersStarting with your existing customer data, Radian Activate will incorporate syndicated data, industry information, and our own experiential insights to discover what it takes to not only re-engage your customer base but also draw in new customers from competitors to increase total basket size and sales.
Real-Time InsightsRadian Activate incorporates customer surveys to understand reactions to presentation, quality, product, brand and store impressions to help you focus on what is important now and in the future.


	Display & Fixture Management


Display & Fixture Management
Complement the Experience With the Right EquipmentRadian Activate leverages its significant Retailer and Foodservice merchandising and operations experience to identify the appropriate fixtures, equipment, and signage needed to support the initiative concept and design.From standalone displays in HBC or Center Store to a complex temperature-controlled set to supporting perishable foods, we have the experience to source and manage these assets as part of our suite of services.
Experience Full-Service Asset ManagementRetailers and Foodservice Distributors already have enough complexity and in-store and market activity to manage without having to worry about sourcing, moving and maintaining equipment. Radian Activate works with your Operations and Transportation teams to facilitate the delivery of equipment to the stores and markets. Our Associates move, set-up, clean, and break down the equipment for each event without burdening in-store staff.Radian Activate also manages the repair and maintenance of the equipment. Additionally, we ensure that all state and local regulatory requirements (food safety, sanitation, weights and measures certification for scales, etc.) are met to ensure the best quality and safety for your customers and stores.


	Concept & Initiative Design


Concept & Initiative Design
Build The Right FoundationSuccess with your customers begins with having the right concept defined and agreed upon. The Radian Activate team has significant experience collaborating with both internal and external stakeholders to design the best product, service, customer experience, operations, and sales solution.Develop the Customer SolutionThere are no shortcuts. Our experience and track record of success provides you with a disciplined and rigorous approach to ensure the sales and customer engagement initiative is executed without delays. We do much of the heavy lifting and then engage your teams thoughtfully to make this a “turn key”’ service for you.Define the Value PropositionAll customers want value—but giving them a “free sample” is not necessarily what customers need, nor does it improve sales or adoption. We recognize that value for some customers is about healthy and convenient meal solutions. For others, it may be about high-quality ingredients for a family meal at a good value. Still others will seek a higher level of service and shopping experience.Radian Activate has partnered with different types of retailers, brands, distributors, and suppliers to develop right initiatives and value proposition in the Fresh, Core Item, Operator, Sales Team, and HBC areas.


	Staffing & Sales Training


Staffing & Sales Training
Leverage Turn Key StaffLabor is a complex part of the Retail and Foodservice environment. We recognize that, for best execution and results, these sales and merchandising initiatives need to be staffed by people with a different profile than traditional store or sales associates.
Minimize Disruption While Meeting Your ObjectivesBased on the business objectives and concept design, we will define and deliver the right type of associates for your initiatives. Our philosophy is to strike the right balance between customer engagement, education and salesmanship to deliver your customer and financial objectives.
The Radian approach allows the Retailers’ and Distributors’ internal staff to leverage their core competencies and minimizes disruption to their everyday roles and responsibilities.
Commit to TrainingEvery customer sales solution is different, and we recognize that we are guests in your stores. With that in mind, we make a significant investment in the training of our Activate Associates. We develop and customize the training content to the product, brand, service, and customer engagement requirements of your strategy, stores, and markets. Depending on the sales initiative, we can leverage our Activate Associates to train your in-store or field support teams, further leveraging Radian capabilities across your enterprise.
Radian Activate incorporates elements of classroom, in-store, and on-the-job training techniques to put our Associates in the best position to succeed. We thrive on generating customer traffic, in-store theater and excitement, and—perhaps most of all—sales to your stores and sales teams.


	Supplier Partner Engagement


Supplier Partner Engagement

Drive Greater Success Through Better CollaborationCollaboration between branded and commodity Suppliers, Retailers, and Foodservice distributors allows the leverage of tools, services, promotional support and ideas to maximize customer engagement and sales opportunities.

Harness Retailer, Distributor, and Supplier Capabilities into a “Customer Solution”Radian Activate has worked with various types of suppliers to integrate their capabilities and ideas into initiative and customer solutions. Often, the business strategy and sales concept requires more than one product or brand coming together to form an easily communicated, easily understood customer or meal solution.

Identify The Right Partners To Drive Sales and Customer EngagementFrom marketing collateral, brand or product attribute messaging, in-store training and support all the way through demand forecasts and weekly store level product allocations, Radian Activate has the resources and expertise to coordinate one or many supplier partners as part of your initiatives.


	Analytics & Initiative Measurement


Analytics & Initiative Measurement
Measure the Success of Your InitiativesDifferent in-market initiatives and events are geared towards different results – brand impressions, customer engagement and store and operator sales. Radian Activate will customize the analytics to best represent the impact of your strategic goals and financial objectives.
Gain Timely and Relevant InformationOur analytics team provides comprehensive reporting, scorecards, and consumer insights that are important to your stakeholders as well as Field teams.

Retailers, Foodservice sales teams, and their supplier partners require efficient in-store and market area sales programs and tools – not just lower impact demos or produce giveaways – to drive sales, shopper and operators experience, and competitiveness.

Product and Program Management


Initiatives and in-store activation programs are often not explicitly linked to an overarching strategic plan, financial objectives, promotional objectives, or promotion calendar.
Multi-supplier participation is often required to provide the right solution for the consumer; however, they are complex and require a great deal of supplier coordination.
Labor and sales force budgets often restrict the ability for associates to create, build, and execute short-term or category specific selling initiatives.
Retailers and Foodservice Distributors need activation teams trained for specific objectives; it is difficult to re-assign associates for a brief period of time or for multiple programs throughout the year.





Before the Event


Volume planning, store level forecasting and ordering to ensure execution
Active communication and visits with participating stores to ensure displays and POS materials in place
Sales associates trained on most important brand and item benefits – and active customer engagement techniques




During The Event


Customer engagement and education on most important brand and item benefits
Store level management and associate education on importance of product quality and attributes
Product “Main Home” filling and engaging customers at “Point of Sale”
Store Management training on “Best Of Class” customer education and cooking methods




After The Event


Review with store level management and associates of “In Store Event” execution and results
Impact analysis of sales penetration by item and department

Poor Perception

“These events are really changing the customer’s perception about our fresh Beef program.  We are making a significant investment in our product quality and item specifications, as well as a media campaign – but these events bring it all to life in our stores.  Not only are we winning in Beef now, but we are converting more customers into the Meat Department and driving higher basket sales.”

Challenge

	A large, national mass retailer wanted to increase penetration in its premium Beef tier to drive more traffic into other categories in the Meat department.  Customers and competitors cited the retailer’s lagging quality and service offering as a reason not buy.  Traditional demos were tried but they did not achieve the sales and customer conversion objectives for the retailer.



Solution 

	We worked extensively with Merchandising, Marketing and Operations to design a best-in-class Fresh Beef event program.  The assortment, display fixtures, signage and customer talking points were aligned with the overarching marketing and customer strategy.  Radian Events sales associates were trained to engage with customers to communicate key product attributes and actively sell items from the event display – or the self-serve case when the events were not in store for maximum long-term benefits.



Project Impact

	The events are not only driving significant sales during the weeks they are in-store, but also sustaining the sales lift after the events.  The premium beef tier saw over 100% growth, the total beef program saw 24% to 26% growth and the total Meat department saw between 8% and 9% growth versus the previous year.  Additionally, the retailer observed sustained level of performance in the event stores well after the events were run indicating both the initial customer conversion and long-term loyalty for the retailer.

 



Steep Competition
“This seafood looks great…I didn't know I could get these kinds of items at this store.  I usually buy my seafood at another store, but now I am buying it here.  This is going to be a treat for my family and it’s a great value.”

		Challenge

		A limited assortment retailer wanted to drive sales and enhance its image in the Perishable departments in a very competitive region against traditional and upscale grocery chains.  The retailer was known for value in dry goods but had an opportunity in their Meat and Seafood quality and service image.  Many of the retailer’s existing core customers were shopping for good quality, fresh meat and seafood and consequently other basket items with their competitors.


		Solution 

		Radian Events worked with the retailer’s Merchandising team to develop the right Seafood assortment, pricing, sourcing, signage, schedule and in-store execution plan.  We also implemented local market and social media marketing techniques to further educate existing customers and the surrounding trade area about the new offering and quality available at this retailer to drive awareness and customer traffic into the stores.


		Project Impact

		Radian Events generated significant sales growth and customer traffic to the Perishables department.  Stores that hosted the “Seafood Roadshows” realized 50% to 100% lift in their fresh seafood items.  Customers were excited to see these products in store and wanted to see both our events and these items in their stores everyday.  Just as important, these events helped drive incremental basket sales for the retailer – roughly $1.30 to $1.50 in incremental basket sales were generated for every dollar purchased out of the Seafood Roadshow display.
 



Aligned Strategy
“Until now, we have never been able to bring together our marketing strategies, store operations and national brands into one easy to understand health and wellness solution for our shoppers.  These events truly changed the way shoppers view our stores and our HBC department.  We have been able to educate our shoppers, generate sales and increase customer loyalty.”

		Challenge

		Executing a large retailer’s ‘Health and Wellness’ strategy required an innovative approach towards in-store display and customer engagement.  Additionally, we needed to integrate the brand marketing and promotional support capabilities of national brand HBC suppliers into common themes and customer solutions.


		Solution 

		Radian Events led a comprehensive initiative with the retailer’s Merchandising and Marketing teams to design events aligned with their Health and Wellness strategy. Radian Events also worked with the branded health, beauty and cosmetics suppliers to integrate key product attributes, brand messaging, customer education and specific sales targets into the program.  We provided a turn-key solution for both the retailer and suppliers by bringing together products, brand marketing and trained sales associates to activate customer engagement.


		Project Impact

		Themed monthly events across beauty, health and weight loss concepts drove in-store theater and significant customer activity into the retailer’s HBC categories and department.  The events were able to generate sales lifts between 5X to 10X for the participating brands in hair care, body wash, beauty/cosmetics and weight loss.  For the retailer, these events drove 25% to 100% sales lift for the total category and 5% to 10% growth for the HBC department.
 



Product Showcase
“We are in much better position in our markets thanks to these events.  Before, our customers did not believe in the freshness and quality of our Perishable departments.  Now, these events let us showcase a level of service, customer engagement and product quality that our competitors cannot replicate.  Radian Events helped us develop, roll-out and manage this program in all of our banners across the country much faster and more consistently than we otherwise would have done using a traditional approach.”

		Challenge

		A large, national grocer was suffering from an identity crisis in their Perishables departments, especially in Seafood.  The retailer’s goal was to not only close the gap in freshness, quality and service but to become a “destination” for Seafood.  This was part of their overall strategy to win in Perishables to drive both store choice and total basket sales.  The retailer needed Radian Events to act as national program manager to coordinate the program and ensure consistent execution across all of its banners, markets and stores.


		Solution 

		Radian Events worked with the lead Merchants and the senior teams from key Seafood suppliers during the initial ideation and concept development work sessions to identify and define the most important customer-facing issues and opportunities.  From there, we worked extensively with suppliers, equipment manufacturers and the Retailer’s Operations team to develop a program managed by Radian Events but executed by store staff to meet their service and quality objectives.  Our role included assortment development, pricing recommendations, promotion planning, store scheduling, store associate training as well as conducting customer intercepts and program analytics.  The solution developed was a multi-year program successfully executed for 10+ banners across the country.


		Project Impact

		These events had significant impact in elevating the fresh and quality image of the retailer – and helped them carve out a competitive advantage as a “seafood destination” in their markets.  Events routinely drove $2,000 to $2,300 in sales of fresh seafood, beef and other proteins.  Additionally, these events actively cross-merchandised high indexing affinity items such as Beer, Wine, Spices, Sauces and Marinades to generate incremental sales.  This cross-merchandising and other promotional activity often generated an additional $1,000 to $2,000 of rest of basket incremental sales.  Over the program life cycle, these events generated over $40 million in target item sales.  Just as importantly the events helped their stores become known for fresh, high quality Perishables.
