            3 Reasons We're Celebrating Father's Day at Dollywood

During the temperance movement, there was an argument that somehow the wine in the Gospels was miraculously non-alcoholic, but is there evidence in the biblical text to support that argument?

Company history[edit]
The Novelis company was spun off from Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer, Alcan Inc. and incorporated in 2005.[4] The company was acquired by India's Hindalco Industries for $6 billion in 2007.[5] The acquisition made Hindalco one of the world's top integrated aluminum players.[6] This makes Novelis a member of the Aditya Birla Group.[7]
Operations[edit]
Novelis is the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet, with operations spanning 11 countries and nearly 11,000 employees. Its Oswego Works automotive department is its highest earning site.[8] The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul, and Sao Paulo. Novelis also has operations in UK, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam .[9] Demand for aluminum is increasing with the continued development of emerging nations, urbanization, and the increasing substitution of aluminum for other materials, making expansion a key consideration.[10] The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014.[11] In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia,[12] a $300 million expansion in Brazil [13] and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.[14]
Novelis recycles approximately 50 billion cans each year.[15]

Company history[edit]
The Novelis company was spun off from Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer, Alcan Inc. and incorporated in 2005.[4] The company was acquired by India's Hindalco Industries for $6 billion in 2007.[5] The acquisition made Hindalco one of the world's top integrated aluminum players.[6] This makes Novelis a member of the Aditya Birla Group.[7]
Operations[edit]
Novelis is the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet, with operations spanning 11 countries and nearly 11,000 employees. Its Oswego Works automotive department is its highest earning site.[8] The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul, and Sao Paulo. Novelis also has operations in UK, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam .[9] Demand for aluminum is increasing with the continued development of emerging nations, urbanization, and the increasing substitution of aluminum for other materials, making expansion a key consideration.[10] The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014.[11] In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia,[12] a $300 million expansion in Brazil [13] and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.[14]
Novelis recycles approximately 50 billion cans each year.[15]

Company history[edit]
The Novelis company was spun off from Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer, Alcan Inc. and incorporated in 2005.[4] The company was acquired by India's Hindalco Industries for $6 billion in 2007.[5] The acquisition made Hindalco one of the world's top integrated aluminum players.[6] This makes Novelis a member of the Aditya Birla Group.[7]
Operations[edit]
Novelis is the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet, with operations spanning 11 countries and nearly 11,000 employees. Its Oswego Works automotive department is its highest earning site.[8] The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul, and Sao Paulo. Novelis also has operations in UK, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam .[9] Demand for aluminum is increasing with the continued development of emerging nations, urbanization, and the increasing substitution of aluminum for other materials, making expansion a key consideration.[10] The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014.[11] In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia,[12] a $300 million expansion in Brazil [13] and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.[14]
Novelis recycles approximately 50 billion cans each year.[15]

Novelis Inc. Company Profile

   Nothing can foil Novelis, because it has the art of rolling aluminum in the can -- the aluminum can, that is. It is a global leader in aluminum rolled products and can recycling. A spinoff of what is now Rio Tinto Alcan, it manufactures aluminum rolled semi-finished products used by the construction and industrial, foil products, transportation, and beverage and food can industries. The rolled aluminum is made with alloy mixtures in a range of hardnesses, thicknesses, and widths, with various coatings and finishes designed specifically for its end-use segments. The company also recycles more than 35 billion beverage cans annually. India's Hindalco Industries, part of the Aditya Birla Group, owns Novelis.

Company history[edit]
The Novelis company was spun off from Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer, Alcan Inc. and incorporated in 2005.[4] The company was acquired by India's Hindalco Industries for $6 billion in 2007.[5] The acquisition made Hindalco one of the world's top integrated aluminum players.[6] This makes Novelis a member of the Aditya Birla Group.[7]
Operations[edit]
Novelis is the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet, with operations spanning 11 countries and nearly 11,000 employees. Its Oswego Works automotive department is its highest earning site.[8] The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul, and Sao Paulo. Novelis also has operations in UK, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam .[9] Demand for aluminum is increasing with the continued development of emerging nations, urbanization, and the increasing substitution of aluminum for other materials, making expansion a key consideration.[10] The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014.[11] In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia,[12] a $300 million expansion in Brazil [13] and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.[14]
Novelis recycles approximately 50 billion cans each year.[15]

Company history[edit]
The Novelis company was spun off from Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer, Alcan Inc. and incorporated in 2005.[4] The company was acquired by India's Hindalco Industries for $6 billion in 2007.[5] The acquisition made Hindalco one of the world's top integrated aluminum players.[6] This makes Novelis a member of the Aditya Birla Group.[7]

Novelis is the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet, with operations spanning 11 countries and nearly 11,000 employees. Its Oswego Works automotive department is its highest earning site.[8] The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul, and Sao Paulo. Novelis also has operations in UK, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam .[9] Demand for aluminum is increasing with the continued development of emerging nations, urbanization, and the increasing substitution of aluminum for other materials, making expansion a key consideration.[10] The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014.[11] In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia,[12] a $300 million expansion in Brazil [13] and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.[14]

Company history[edit]
The Novelis company was spun off from Canadian mining and aluminum manufacturer, Alcan Inc. and incorporated in 2005.[4] The company was acquired by India's Hindalco Industries for $6 billion in 2007.[5] The acquisition made Hindalco one of the world's top integrated aluminum players.[6] This makes Novelis a member of the Aditya Birla Group.[7]
Operations[edit]
Novelis is the world’s largest producer of rolled aluminum sheet, with operations spanning 11 countries and nearly 11,000 employees. Its Oswego Works automotive department is its highest earning site.[8] The company divides its operations into four regions: North America, Europe, Asia, and South America. The regional headquarters are Atlanta, Zurich, Seoul, and Sao Paulo. Novelis also has operations in UK, Germany, Italy, France, Canada, China, Malaysia and Vietnam .[9] Demand for aluminum is increasing with the continued development of emerging nations, urbanization, and the increasing substitution of aluminum for other materials, making expansion a key consideration.[10] The company invested $100 million in its first manufacturing facility in China, which opened in 2014.[11] In response to global demand for aluminum sheet for automotive, electronics and beverage cans, the company has announced capital investments including a $400 million expansion in Asia,[12] a $300 million expansion in Brazil [13] and $200 million expansion in North America. In July 2014, it announced that Reynolds Consumer Products Inc., a subsidiary of the Rank Group of New Zealand, purchased the North American consumer products division of Novelis, for CAD $33.75mn.[14]
Novelis recycles approximately 50 billion cans each year.[15]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
