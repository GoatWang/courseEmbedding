BALTIMORE, Jan. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Legg Mason, Inc. (NYSE:    LM) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to combine Permal, Legg Mason's existing hedge fund platform, with EnTrust Capital. EnTrust is a leading independent hedge fund investor and alternative asset manager headquartered in New York with approximately $12 billion in total assets and complementary investment strategies, investor base and business mix to Permal.  The business combination will create a new global alternatives firm with over $26 billion in pro-forma AUM1 and total assets of $29 billion2.  The firm will have a diverse offering of proprietary investment products with a significant number of institutional and high net worth investors. As a result of the combination, Legg Mason will own 65% of the new entity, branded EnTrustPermal, with 35% being owned by Gregg S. Hymowitz, EnTrust's Co-founder and Managing Partner.


EnTrustPermal will be led by Mr. Hymowitz, who will become the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EnTrustPermal.  Key investment and business professionals from both firms will continue to serve the investors of the new organization.  EnTrustPermal will have the global infrastructure, resources, investment professionals and underlying investment managers to source, research and structure investment opportunities worldwide on behalf of its international client base.
The combination creates a platform with the necessary scale and leadership team to significantly expand and evolve its multi-alternative capabilities and offerings.  The expanded investment capabilities include:

A combined team of over 55 investment professionals, with key leaders from both firms signing contracts 
Over 150 unique investment offerings across 18 different investment-strategies 
A materially larger investment platform, ranging from opportunistic co-investments with longer duration locked-up capital, tail-risk hedging strategies and bespoked customized investment solutions 
A more rapid evolution of innovative, alternative products and lines of business, including direct hedge funds and private debt offerings 
Increased sources of proprietary investment opportunities 
Ability to broaden the organization's innovative existing Managed Account Platform 
Joseph A. Sullivan, Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason, said, "The combined EnTrustPermal brings together two leading names in the alternative space, creating a significant potential growth engine for Legg Mason.  The team at EnTrust has a proven track record for driving significant organic growth through product innovation, with over 20% growth annually since the financial crisis.  We see meaningful opportunities to combine this innovation with Permal's blue chip client base, product offering and global footprint."
Gregg S. Hymowitz, Managing Partner of EnTrust, said, "The combination of EnTrust and Permal creates a powerful organization in the hedge fund universe.  EnTrustPermal's scale, resources and global investment talent will be able to deliver market differentiated proprietary investments to our over 700 combined institutional accounts and significant number of high-net worth investors.  The complementary nature of our investment strategies, geographies and global investor/partner base dramatically springboards us over our competition.   The EnTrust and Permal teams are eager to start delivering for our loyal investor base."
Omar Kodmani, Permal Group Chief Executive Officer, said, "The future of our industry is about offering alternative investment solutions on multiple fronts.  To achieve this, you need scale and talent and EnTrustPermal combines both.  We currently have one of the best resourced investment teams in the industry and which, when paired with EnTrust offers more to our clients and strengthens our business."
The combination is expected to close in mid-2016.  The transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to Legg Mason's earnings in the first year, after giving effect to estimated cost savings achieved that year and excluding restructuring and transition charges.   Legg Mason expects EnTrustPermal to achieve cost savings of approximately $35-$40 million per year.  In connection with the combination of the businesses, Legg Mason expects to incur restructuring and transition costs of approximately $100 million, beginning in the Company's 4th Fiscal Quarter of 2016 and continuing throughout Fiscal Year 2017.  
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC has acted as financial advisor to Legg Mason in connection with this transaction. Goldman Sachs acted as the financial advisor to EnTrust with respect to the transaction.

Legg Mason hedge fund platform Permal to combine with EnTrust Capital

Platforms











Legg Mason has agreed to combine Permal, its existing hedge fund platform, with EnTrust Capital, an independent hedge fund investor and alternative asset manager headquartered in New York with approximately USD12 billion in total assets.
The business combination will create a new global alternatives firm with over $USD6 billion in pro-forma AUM and total assets of USD29 billion and will have a diverse offering of proprietary investment products with a significant number of institutional and high net worth investors.
 
As a result of the combination, Legg Mason will own 65 per cent of the new entity, branded EnTrustPermal, with 35 per cent being owned by Gregg S Hymowitz, EnTrust's Co-founder and Managing Partner.
 
EnTrustPermal will be led by Hymowitz, who will become the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EnTrustPermal. Key investment and business professionals from both firms will continue to serve the investors of the new organisation. EnTrustPermal will have the global infrastructure, resources, investment professionals and underlying investment managers to source, research and structure investment opportunities worldwide on behalf of its international client base.
 
Joseph A Sullivan, Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason, says: "The combined EnTrustPermal brings together two leading names in the alternative space, creating a significant potential growth engine for Legg Mason. The team at EnTrust has a proven track record for driving significant organic growth through product innovation, with over 20 per cent growth annually since the financial crisis. We see meaningful opportunities to combine this innovation with Permal's blue chip client base, product offering and global footprint."
 
Gregg S Hymowitz, Managing Partner of EnTrust, says: "The combination of EnTrust and Permal creates a powerful organization in the hedge fund universe. EnTrustPermal's scale, resources and global investment talent will be able to deliver market differentiated proprietary investments to our over 700 combined institutional accounts and significant number of high-net worth investors. The complementary nature of our investment strategies, geographies and global investor/partner base dramatically springboards us over our competition. The EnTrust and Permal teams are eager to start delivering for our loyal investor base."

History[edit]
In 2005, Permal was acquired by Legg Mason in an $800 million transaction and operates as a subsidiary of that company.[3]
In 2013, Permal acquired Fauchier Partners, a leading European based manager of funds of hedge funds, from BNP Paribas Investment Partners.[4]
In 2016, is was announced that the Permal Group subsidiary would merge with EnTrust Capital to increase assets.[5]
Investment funds[edit]
Permal offers a range of multi-manager, multi-strategy funds as well as single manager funds and customized separate accounts. The firm's flagship product, Permal Investment Holding, was launched in 1992 and is a global multi-strategy fund of hedge funds, managed by Robert Kaplan. The fund aims to capture two thirds of the upside during a bull market and seeks to limit its downside to one third of a comparable index during the bear market.
Permal also operates as a private equity fund of funds and secondary investment firm through its subsidiary, Permal Capital Management.
In 2016, Legg Mason announced it would merge its Permal Group subsidiary with EnTrust Capital to increase assets managed by its hedge funds-of-funds business to $26 billion.[6]

              A look back at Microsoft's rapid rise during the late 1990s shows investors are still being much more cautious with large technology stocks than they were during the dot-com boom.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, you will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds, which can be substantially higher than fees associated with mutual funds. The Fund may invest in unregistered hedge funds which are highly speculative investments that employ aggressive investment strategies, and carry substantial risk. Investments in hedge funds are generally illiquid, difficult to value and may carry significant restrictions for transferring assets. Some of the underlying funds employ leverage, which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the Fund to magnified losses if an underlying fund's investments decline in value. The Fund and some of the underlying funds may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Some of the underlying funds may employ short selling, a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short. The Fund and each underlying fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in higher portfolio turnover and transaction costs. There is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the Fund or underlying funds will be successful. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Small-and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities fall. High-yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage related securities are subject to additional risks such as prepayment and extension risks. 
 Please see the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the Fund's risks.

 Performance 






Performance




Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so shares, when redeemed, maybe worth more or less than the original cost. Fund performance figures reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which the performance would have been lower. For the period prior to the June 28, 2013, Fund’s inception, the performance shown is that of Permal Hedge Strategies Fund I Service Shares incepted on February 1, 2012.
The maximum sales charge is 3.00%. Fund performance figures are net of fees, including a 1.10% management fee, 0.80% distribution/servicing fee, acquired fund (underlying manager) fees, and other Fund expenses. Performance results for the Fund are short-term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating performance potential over varying market conditions or market cycles. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports.








Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 


































**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) Broker reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2017 without Board consent. The Gross and Net Expenses listed include 4.21 of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses ("AFFE") that are required to be shown in the Fund's prospectus. AFFE reflects the Fund's pro rata share of fees and expenses relating to its investments in acquired funds; however, AFFE are not incurred directly by the Fund. Therefore, AFFE are not reflected in the Fund's audited financial statements or financial highlights.


Underlying manager fees: In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, Fund shareholders will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds. Generally, underlying manager fees include 1% to 3% management fee and a 15% to 25% incentive fee.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Distributions









The per share distribution amounts presented above reflect the distribution rates that were paid to shareholders on the indicated payable dates. The character of distributions for certain funds may have been subsequently adjusted for tax purposes.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: An investment in the Fund is not suitable for all investors, is illiquid and should be considered speculative. An investment in the Fund entails unique risks because the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund will invest are private entities with limited regulatory oversight and disclosure obligations. Because the Fund invests in underlying Portfolio Funds, the managers may not be able to shift allocations in time to capture an immediate or sudden spike in the market. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
The information shown above relates to Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio, the registered investment company in which the Fund invests substantially all of its investable assets. The Fund utilizes a master/feeder structure by investing all of its assets in the Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio. Assets are reported at the master portfolio level.
Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board's quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

One of the many recent mergers involved EnTrust Capital and Permal Group, the latter of which is Legg Mason’s hedge-fund platform subsidiary that was purchased by Legg Mason in 2005.Under the terms of the transaction, Legg Mason will own 65% of the combined firm, to be known as EnTrustPermal, with the remainder to be owned by EnTrust co-founder and Managing Partner Gregg Hymowitz.“The combination of EnTrust and Permal creates a powerful organization in the hedge fund universe,” said Mr. Hymowitz, in a statement issued by Legg Mason. “The complementary nature of our investment strategies, geographies and global investor/partner base dramatically springboards us over our competition.”Greater Scale and ResourcesAs a result of the merger, the new firm’s scale, resources, and global investment talent will be able to deliver proprietary investments to over 700 institutional accounts and a “significant number” of high-net-worth investors, according to Mr. Hymowitz. The combination of the two firms will create a platform with expanded alternative capabilities and offerings, including:More than 55 investment professionalsOver 150 unique investment offerings across 18 different strategiesAn expansive platform ranging from “opportunistic co-investments” to “tail-risk hedging strategies” and “bespoked” customized investment solutionsMore proprietary investment opportunitiesDirect hedge funds and private debt offeringsA broadened Managed Account platform“The combined EnTrustPermal brings together two leading names in the alternative space, creating a significant potential growth engine for Legg Mason,” said Legg Mason CEO and Chairman Joseph Sullivan. “The team at EnTrust has a proven track record for driving significant organic growth through product innovation, with over 20% growth annually since the financial crisis. We see meaningful opportunities to combine this innovation with Permal’s blue chip client base, product offering and global footprint.”Deal to Close in Mid-2016The deal, which is expected to close in mid-2016, should be modestly accretive to Legg Mason’s earnings that year, excluding restructuring and transition charges, which are estimated at $100 million. Ultimately, Legg Mason expects EnTrustPermal to achieve cost savings of between $35 million and $40 million per year.Permal is the manager of two multi-alternative mutual funds:Permal Alternative Core Fund (LPTIX) launched in April 2009 and allocates its assets across alternative and traditional asset classes. The fund ranks in the 26th, 16th and 9th percentiles over the past 1, 3 and 5-year periods ending January 31, 2016.Permal Alternative Select Fund (PASWX) launched in February 2014 and allocates its assets to hedged equity, event driven and global macro strategies. For the year ending January 31, 2016, the fund returned -9.23%, ranking it in the bottom 14% of funds in its Morningstar category.Past performance does not necessarily predict future results.Jason Seagraves contributed to this article.
