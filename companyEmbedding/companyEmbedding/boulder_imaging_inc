Web Inspection
Photonics SpectraJul 2011Boulder Imaging Inc.Request Info 
        

            Boulder Imaging Inc. has released Vision Inspector Beacon for
web inspection in the film, plastic, paper, glass, solar film and semiconductor
industries. Suitable for in-line materials inspection, defect detection, defect
archiving, and real-time awareness and reporting across a wide range of defects,
the system is built to achieve high throughput rates with zero false positives.
It identifies defects and anomalies in materials at speeds in excess of 900 ft/min
and addresses inspection requirements such as registration, presence/absence, alignment,
color matching and surface irregularities. Proprietary hardware and software provide
inspection as well as data retention capabilities. The design is composed of an
inspection station, the archive and reporting server and the event viewer client
(EVC). Features include variable views and presentations of data on the EVC.Visit company websitehttp://www.boulderimaging.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=1928
