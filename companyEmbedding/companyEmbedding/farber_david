FARBER MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND  1. I am The Alfred Fitler Moore Professor of Telecommunication Systems at            the Moore School of Engineering of the University of Pennnsylvania in            Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. I have held that endowed chair since 1994.            From 1988 to 1994 I was a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical            Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. From 1977 to 1988, I            was a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the            University of Delaware. From 1970 to 1977, I was an Associate Professor            of Information and Computer Sciences and Electrical Engineering at the            University of California at Irvine. A copy of my curriculum vitae is            attached as Exhibit A to this testimony.          	2.  As you will see from my curriculum vitae, I have since 1988 been Director of the Distributed Systems Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania.  That Laboratory is the center for research activities in the general systems area for both computer sciences and electrical engineering at the University. In that capacity I am involved in high speed network research with emphasis on its impact on hardware and operating systems.   Over the last ten years my research has generally focused on the areas of high speed networking and the implications of that networking on interconnections, protocols and computer hardware and software architecture. During that period, I have also taught graduate and undergraduate courses in the computer science field, including course work concerning software development.   	3.  From 1987 to 1988, I was Director of the Center for Networking Technology and Applications at the University of Delaware.  As Director I was instrumental in the definition and implementation of the early stages of commercialization of the Internet.    During the period I was at the University of Delaware, my research work was principally in the area of distributed systems with a focus on the hardware and software necessary to implement such systems. I also led the creation of the University's own computer network and directed University-wide research in distributed systems.    	4. In my years at the University of California at Irvine, I created and led what was then one of the largest computer research activity funded by the National Science Foundation -- the Distributed Computer Research Project.  That Project created much of the software concepts for future distributed systems activities.   	5.  During my career, as detailed in my curriculum vitae, I have been Principal Investigator on a number of research projects (funded by government and private sources)  related to computer software design and methodology.  I have also been awarded two patents.  I have published numerous articles in the computer science field and have lectured regularly in this country and around the world at various university and industry seminars.     	6.  I also have been regularly involved in activities in the business side of computers.   I was a founder and Vice President of Caine, Farber and Gordon, Inc. ("CFG"), a private firm which is involved in program design methodology.  CFG was an early creator of advanced software and compilers for microsystems and much of the Intel software support for the 8080 (the first pc-family microchip).   	7.  I  have been on the technical staffs of Xerox Data Systems, the RAND Corporation and Bell Laboratories.  I am currently on the technical advisory boards of a number of major corporations in the computer field, including Earthlink, Covad and Com21.       	8.  I have not testified in deposition or at trial as an expert witness in the last ten years, although I have consulted for parties in litigation in the past.  I am being paid $300 per hour for my work for the government in this case.     THE SUBJECT MATTER OF MY TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES 	9.   I have been asked by the Department of Justice to provide my expert opinions on software designed to function as a computer operating system and software applications that browse the World Wide Web via the Internet.  The latter software is commonly referred to as an Internet or web browser (which I describe further below). In particular, I will discuss:   the software development process and its implication for software products;     the relationships between operating systems and application software, including Web browsers (as defined below);   the significant inefficiencies in designing so-called operating systems which include inappropriate functions such as software applications (e.g.Web browsers); and     the negative consequences of permitting Microsoft to add what are now applications to create an ever-larger, monolithic software package which Microsoft calls its "operating system" for personal computers.  	These subjects will be addressed from the viewpoints of  software developers, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and retail end users.    	10.  My testimony is based entirely on my lifetime of experience in the field of computer science.  The matters about which I  testify here concern commonly understood and accepted principles and practices in the field of computer science which are applicable to all software, whether developed by Microsoft or any other company.  For that reason, I have done not, and do not believe it is necessary for me to do, extensive analytical work on the details of Windows 98 software (such as Professor Felten has done) in preparation for this testimony.  My preparatory work (apart from preparing my report, this testimony and being deposed by Microsoft counsel) has been limited to a meeting with Professor Felten,  review of certain memoranda filed by the parties with the Court, this Court's  opinion denying summary judgment in this case and the Court of Appeals' decision of June 1998 concerning the Consent Decree entered against Microsoft.   TERMINOLOGY USED IN MY TESTIMONY 	11.  I and, I expect, other witnesses will use several technical terms for which I think it is useful to provide my definition for the Court.   These definitions include the following:     Software is the programs, routines, rules, instructions, and associated documentation of a computer system.    An  Operating System is software that controls the execution of programs on computer systems and may provide low-level services such as resource allocation, scheduling and input-output control in a form which is sufficiently simple and general so that these services are broadly useful to software developers.     A Software Component is software that provides a specialized function or service in a form that can be incorporated into a variety of applications.    An Application is a collection of software functions used to perform specific user-oriented tasks.   A Browser is a software application that allows its users to examine the content of an information collection in a user friendly manner.  What is commonly referred to as an Internet or Web browser permits the user to examine, display, scan, and navigate via the Internet a particular information collection on the World Wide Web.   THE METHODOLOGY OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT 	12.   The process of designing, writing, modifying, and testing software is one which is the subject of academic analysis and writing.   Modern software is developed in small modules (i.e., routines, subroutines, methods, functions, procedures, etc.) which are aggregated into larger modules (i.e., files), which are in turn aggregated into software products.    	13.  The nature of  the software development process, motivated in part by  human limitations in managing design complexity and in part by a motivation of functional reusability,  imposes a modular structure on software. A module is the computer software equivalent of a paragraph, in which, via one or more routines,   one reasonably-sized function is accomplished.  Each routine is a sequence of instructions (i.e. lines of code -- often in one of a number of  high level programming languages).  An instruction is a call on a lower level routine requesting that the function of the lower level routine be performed using data provided by the higher level routine. For example, if a computer is asked to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle, it will have to call a lower level routine which computes the sine or cosine of the angle.   At the lowest levels, an instruction is directly interpreted by the processor after possible translation by a compiler.One example would be a command to add two integers together.  Routines typically contain a few tens to a few hundreds of lines of code each.    	14.  These software modules are then "knitted together" into unified programs.  That is, each software product is built up from simple low level routines that are then called by routines at a higher level of composition.  Routines at each level are called by yet higher level routines until the desired functionality of the end product is achieved.  In this manner, all software is built up layer by layer through the use of often large numbers of routines, but each with limited complexity.       	15.  As a result of this layering, software has an inherently malleable and modular structure which gives software developers broad freedom in combining  (i.e. bundling) different functions into software products.  This malleability also gives a software developer two related types of design freedom: (1) to integrate two separate cd-roms because the functions on one particular cd-rom can be integrated by an OEM or retail end user with functions on another cd-rom and (2) to determine which functions to include within software sold as one product and which to separate and sell as a different product, whether produced by the same or a different software developer, for installation and use together by the a retail end user. Therefore, for example, software malleability provides a developer with the freedom to choose whether to incorporate a particular application (such as a Web browser) into a software product or sell that application separately for later combination by another software developer or retail end user with other software.   	16.  A common theme in software engineering and among software development methodologies is the advocacy for, and techniques in support of,  the modular design and implementation of software.  There are several efficiencies which result from development of software in this modular form.  These include reduced errors in the development process, easier testing of products, reduced cost and complexity for maintenance and upgrades, and greater possible sharing of software modules among separate products. For example, the function of a computer which permits it to determine the sine of an angle should be modularized so that any application can call that function and, if there are any improvements or errors, the source can be more readily found and changed or corrected.   	17.  Applications may be large, often involving a very large number of  routines. Examples of applications are Microsoft Word, Notepad and Speech Recorder -- as well as Internet Explorer.  Software, including  applications, must be stored in the form of files. The formation of these types of files (sometimes called dynamically linked libraries or DLLs in the Microsoft Windows world) should be dictated primarily by considerations of storage/loading efficiency (time to prepare the software to run), file reusability (the ability to use all or most of file in more than one application) and execution performance.  The most technically efficient size for a file is generally larger than a single routine and smaller than an entire application. Thus, the aggregation of routines into products involves two processes: the routines of the product must be aggregated into files, which must then be aggregated into products, often with connecting code.         	18.   All the routines that are called directly or indirectly by a program should be available when the program is being used. But whether those routines originate from one particular software program or another is irrelevant to the performance of the functions, so long as the software is written and installed such that the programs work together.  Moreover, a software developer is free (subject to minimal limitations of no relevance here) to change the partitioning of routines among files at any time without changing their function or correct operation when the files are combined during execution in an end user's computer. Thus, there is generally no technical reason why a particular routine must be included in the same file with another routine so long as the routines are appropriately compiled and linked in the end user's computer.    	19.  There are several software tools  (i.e.,  software analogous to machine tools in the manufacturing world) that are used by software developers to accomplish this process of "knitting together" routines into files and, in turn, into programs.  These tools include compilers, linkers and loaders.  A compiler translates instructions (written in a language efficient for  programmers) into the language understood by the computer hardware.  A linker takes separately compiled program units (i.e., files or sets of routines) and combines them into a complete program.  A loader loads programs, or parts of a program, into the memory of a computer in a form in which it can be executed.  Programs are normally compiled only by the software developer and the resulting code files are delivered to the customer.  Although the end user may not realize it, loading is typically done by the end user as part of his/her initiating execution of an application.  Linking can be performed statically by the software developer or dynamically when needed for execution of an application.            APPROPRIATE METHODS TO DEVELOP APPLICATIONS TO RUN ONA PARTICULAR OPERATING SYSTEM 	20.  Developers of software, whether end user applications or OEM components, write their programs with the expectation that certain functions can and will be performed by the operating system of the computer on which the software will be used.  The application invokes the operating system by calling routines supplied as part of the operating system.  The interconnection is referred to as an application-programming interface (API).  An API is the software convention that must be satisfied by a programmer when calling a function provided by the operating system.  Access to and use of APIs allows: (1) an application developer to avoid what otherwise may be the expense of writing or purchasing all of the software necessary and (2) the application to run on a computer in conjunction with a specific operating system.     	21.  Developers of software applications depend on functions provided by the operating system.  In that sense, application software developers and any operating system developer share a mutual dependency: applications developers rely on the presence of certain simple, general functions to which they interconnect their applications via APIs while an operating system developer must offer appropriate functions and APIs to which applications developers can write applications in sufficient quantity and quality that OEMs and end users will choose to buy both the operating system and applications.   	22.   From at least a technical viewpoint, the most efficient operating system is one that includes only those functions described in Paragraph 11(b) above which will be used by large numbers of application and component software development projects or are, by their unusual and peculiar nature, required to be at the operating system level.  An example of the latter is security and protection of other operating system functions, which has become more critical as personal computers interconnect in networks which could otherwise invade and damage those computers' operating system functions.  Moreover, only functions that are critical to the operating system itself or functions that the operating system makes available in the form of simple, general purpose APIs exist in a very efficient operating system. By way of example, network software that regulates the transfer of information to or from an ethernet card is normally part of an operating system while the file transfer client, which is further up the chain of routines, should not be in the operating system.  This distinction is based on real time performance demands and security needs.   	23.  Inclusion of inappropriate functions at the level of what some software developers call an "operating system" is very likely to impose inefficiencies on application and other software developers, OEMs and retail end users.   If the developers must use the particular functions, inappropriately placed in what I and others in the field refer to as "the operating system environment" (to distinguish it from what I consider to be an appropriate operating system), because of the manner in which that operating system environment is written or marketed, developers who need to write applications for that so-called "operating system" will, by definition, be forced to use that particular function regardless of whether that developer would prefer to use another software routine or develop a new one. Even if the structure and marketing of the operating system environment permits the addition of similar functions in addition to the functions provided by the operating system environment, the developer who wants or needs a different method of achieving a particular function must nevertheless write or buy often expensive, additional software. This duplication will likely:  (1) increase storage requirements for different versions of software separately developed and included by the operating system vendor and application developer, (2) cause performance degradation from unused functions of the operating system and (3) increase risks of "bugs" (i.e., malfunctions) in software.  THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MICROSOFT'S BUNDLINGOF ITS SO-CALLED OPERATING SYSTEM WITH ITS INTERNET BROWSER 	24.  Microsoft claims in its memoranda filed with this Court that certain "efficiencies" result from its "integration" of some of the files (or DLLs) that are included in its Internet Explorer (IE) product as part of Windows 98 (which I refer to as an "operating system environment plus applications" to distinguish it from my definition of a true operating system and an operating system environment).  The claims that efficiencies exist from this combination of functions are misleading. While the combination may offer certain efficiencies, these same efficiencies can be achieved without bundling of the Web browser software with what Microsoft calls its Windows operating system.   This is because there are no technical barriers that prevent Microsoft from developing and selling its Windows operating system as a stand alone product separate from its browser software -- or other software functions beyond the appropriate operating system functions.  Windows 98 (like all other software) necessarily consists of modules which are malleable and separable.  There are no technical efficiencies for users achieved by combining Microsoft's browser software with the remainder of the software sold as Windows 98 that could not be achieved by writing two programs in a manner that later could be loaded and "integrated" either by the retail end user (i.e., just as end users install any other application that runs on Windows) or by an OEM.     	25.  One example of such a division of the existing Windows 98 would be that which I understand Professor Felten has developed with his team.  The software which is necessary to accomplish Web browsing  can be separated from the remainder of  Windows 98 and sold on a separate disk (or some other distinct method).  Yet, if an OEM or end user so desires, the operating system, operating system environment and browser application software can be installed by them to create the current version of Windows 98 (with the browser software labelled for commercial purposes as a Microsoft product called Internet Explorer); if that is not desired, an alternative Web browser can be installed with the Windows 98 operating system environment.  Moreover, given the completely malleable nature of software and the apparently extensive number of files included in Windows 98, there are very likely to be  alternative ways to separate Microsoft's web browsing software from those files which could and should be part of a Windows 98.             THE NEGATIVE TECHNICAL CONSEQUENCES OF PERMITTING MICROSOFTTO BUNDLE APPLICATIONS AND OTHER SOFTWARE FUNCTIONS INTO ITS            OPERATING SYSTEM 	26.  I understand that Microsoft claims that it should be permitted to include any software it chooses in its Windows product so long as some efficiency can be articulated as a result of the "integration" of that software into that product.  But if that standard were adopted by this Court,  then any application could be bundled into Microsoft's Windows product -- regardless of the ability, inherent in the nature of software described above, to achieve that efficiency without combining the applications into an ever larger bundle of software which includes not only operating system functions but operating environment functions and applications.   Taken to its logical extreme, that standard would mean that Microsoft could bundle together all its existing and future applications with its current (already massive) product sold as Windows 98.  Windows 98 (or whatever later version of Windows) could become the one and only universal software product, and only Microsoft could develop software for Intel-based personal computers.  For example, Microsoft could next claim that, because there are some functions which overlap between Windows 98 and Microsoft's suite of applications called Office, now sold separately, those applications could be bundled into one product to achieve some "efficiency".  But there is no such "efficiency" which cannot be achieved by the same separate distribution of those applications and their "integration" by an OEM or retail end user when the applications are installed (as is now the case).   	27.  In my view, any analysis of the propriety of such actions by Microsoft should take at least the three technical factors discussed above into account:    for software, "efficiencies" achieved through combination of different functions into one so-called "integrated" software program can also be achieved without that combination by a software developer by simply separating that program into two or more pieces, distributed separately and, if so desired, integrated for use by an OEM or retail end user;   combining applications with an operating system into a single product available only with all functions combined imposes technical inefficiencies for OEMs, other software developers and retail end users, including redundancy, performance degradation of unused software and increased risks of "bugs"; and   any function provided by an operating system (as distinct from higher level files) that does not satisfy the criteria of simplicity, general applicability and accessibility reduces the efficiency of the operating system environment and applications that use it.  28. None of the above denies the possible convenience or preference            of some users for "one stop shopping" for bundled products such as the            current version of Windows 98 sold as one product by Microsoft. Those            OEMs and retail end users who may find this convenience outweighs any            technical inefficiencies described here can certainly still choose to            buy Windows 98 in the form it now exists. But only the availability            of an unbundled version of Windows 98 will cure the difficulties which            arise for many OEMs, application developers and retail end users who            may find too burdensome the problems arising from their inability to            substitute different functions and applications (such as the Web browser)            for use with only parts of what is now sold as Windows 98. The OEMs,            developers and retail end users who do not want all the software that            Microsoft sells as Windows 98 (including, for example, what Microsoft            labels Internet Explorer) suffer the inefficiencies described above.            Given the ease with which a properly structured browser application            can be unbundled from Windows 98, I know of no technical reason why            any OEMs, software developers or retail end users must suffer these            negative consequences.          I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.   _____________________________               David J. Farber  Executed on October 8, 1998.   Exhibit A  DAVID J. FARBER PERSONAL INFORMATION  Home Address:          Business Address:          EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE  The Alfred Filler Moore Professor of Telecommunication Systems, Moore            School, University of Pennsylvania (1988 - present)           Research work has concentrated in ultra high speed networking and                the implications of that on processor interconnect, protocols and                software. This has created several joint study agreements with industrial                research laboratories such as Bellcore and the RBOCS (Project Dawn                - with MIT), IBM and Bellcore (Project Aurora - with MIT), and to                becoming one of the principals of the NSF/Darpa research project                in Gigabit Networking and Chairman of the Coordination Committee.  Director of the Distributed Systems Laboratory, University of Pennsylvania                (1988 -present)  The DSL is the focus of the research activities in the general              systems area of both the Computer Sciences and the Electrical Engineering              Departments. The past year has seen extensive physical plant improvements              as well as a major revamping of the educational and research programs.

 In this book, David Farber grounds our understanding of the extraordinary history of the 1960s by linking the events of that era to our country's grand projects of previous decades. Farber's important study, based on years of research in archives and oral histories as well as in historical literature, explores Vietnam, the Civil Rights Act, the War on Poverty, the entertainment business, the drug culture, and much more.

From Publishers Weekly


Farber ( Chicago '68 ) writes that "with President Kennedy's death, Americans confronted a grim reality: not all of America's possibilities were good." Following the country's unprecedented prosperity and world influence after WW II, the '60s were marked by emerging violence and discontent--the Watts riots, brutal political killings--the fearsome responses to shattered hopes. Farber sketches an arresting picture of a national midlife crisis recorded and disseminated in part by an infectious TV culture that, for the first time, provided the majority of Americans with their news, and hit an unlikely nerve with the ever popular story of a poor family making good-- The Beverly Hillbillies . Beatniks, Beatles, Timothy Leary and marijuana busts shared prime time with Vietnam, Mario Salvio's Free Speech movement, Black Power and the landmark Civil Rights Act (Lyndon Johnson reportedly said to segregationist Sen. Richard Russell, "get out of my way. I'm going to run over you"). The great dreams of the '60s, like Johnson's Great Society, collided with the explosive realities. With deft overview, Farber explores the many intertwined movements, including Kennedy's strident anti-communist election campaign that later contributed to his committing combat troops in Vietnam. Although the complex arts and letters get short shrift in favor of pop culture, and a sense of pastiche is inevitable, readers who lived through the '60s--or wish they did--will relish this work.

From Library Journal


In this reasoned and readable survey of the momentous social and political events of the 1960s, historian Farber sympathetically looks at this period without rose-colored glasses, critically analyzing it without assigning blame. He treats the decade as a critical period of change--of creativity and chaos--that grew out of an increasingly consumer-oriented post-World War II, society reaching out to absorb all Americans. The civil rights revolution, the Vietnam War, the urban riots, the rise of rock music, the decade's rise and fall of the Great Society, and the assassinations are all woven together masterfully in a historical narrative that successfully communicates the era's zeitgeist. Especially interesting is Farber's final chapter explaning how the 1970s and the beginning of the Reagan era evolved from the burned-out fragments of the 1960s. A synthesis of late 20th-century American political and social history against which future books on the decade will be measured.- Jack Forman, Mesa Coll. Lib., San DiegoCopyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsGood readByAmazon Customeron March 7, 2015Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is a terrific overview of the 1960s and the many revolutions and paradigm shifts that occurred within the decade. I would have liked to read more about the reactions of mainstream Americans to the tumultuous events of the decade. I would have also liked a chapter on NASA and the Apollo missions. The lunar landing  was only briefly mentioned in this book. But if you are a person who wants to learn about the 1960s, this is great book to read. It covers Civil Rights, the Cold War, Vietnam, the counter culture, rock music, the Great society, and most things 1960s.Read more0Comment|

            Dana-Farber Cancer Institute names David Feinberg as VP, chief marketing officer
















April 11, 2017
Tags: Appointments


Previously led marketing for NewYork-Presbyterian HospitalDana-Farber Cancer Institute has named David A. Feinberg to the newly-created position of vice president and chief marketing officer (CMO). Feinberg previously served as vice president and chief marketing officer for New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Healthcare Network in New York City.“David is a proven leader who has led the development of some of healthcare’s best and most successful marketing campaigns,” said Laurie Glimcher, MD, president and CEO of Dana-Farber. “He understands healthcare deeply, and he is committed to our mission of improving the lives of people with cancer everywhere.”Feinberg joined New York-Presbyterian Hospital in 1997 as their first vice president of marketing, where he established a robust program to brand and market the hospital, which was created from the merger of The New York Hospital and The Presbyterian Hospital. As CMO, Feinberg was responsible for the development and implementation of marketing, advertising, physician referral, internet, and visitor information strategies. He is known for leading development of NewYork-Presbyterian’s “Amazing Things are Happening Here” campaign, widely recognized as one of the best of its kind.At Dana-Farber, Feinberg will be responsible for the strategic direction and day-to-day operations of consumer, digital and physician outreach programs to build the Institute’s brand visibility and clinical volume.“It is an honor to join the Dana-Farber family and work alongside some of the most accomplished physicians, researchers, and administrators anywhere,” Feinberg said. “Dana-Farber is a stellar organization, and I’m eager to help bring its message of quality care and research to an ever-wider range of people.”“I have known David and his work for years and am thrilled that he will be joining us,” said Steven Singer, senior vice president for communications at Dana-Farber. “David’s creativity, energy, and depth of experience will be a great asset to the entire Dana-Farber community.”Before joining New York Presbyterian, Feinberg led the health care practice of The Seiden Group, an advertising and marketing firm based in New York City. He began his career in the pharmaceutical and consumer industries, working at Procter & Gamble, Clairol and Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis). Feinberg graduated from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics, and from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management with a Master’s Degree in management and marketing.

This collection of original essays represents some of the most exciting ways in which historians are beginning to paint the 1960s onto the larger canvas of American history. While the first literature about this turbulent period was written largely by participants, many of the contributors to this volume are young scholars who came of age intellectually in the 1970s and 1980s and thus write from fresh perspectives.

Adventures




One of the best aspects of moving to Colorado at the end of 2014 has been getting the opportunity to explore at any moment. Through camping and hiking a number of 14ers, I have become captivated by the outdoors and the journey it has sent me on. Combining my interests in hiking and exploring, with my self-proclaimed status as an amateur photographer, I have started an ever growing collection of photos from my adventures.

Overview



Alfred P. Sloan Jr. became the president of General Motors in 1923 and stepped down as its CEO in 1946. During this time, he led GM past the Ford Motor Company and on to international business triumph by virtue of his brilliant managerial practices and his insights into the new consumer economy he and GM helped to produce. Bill Gates has said that Sloan's 1964 management tome, My Years with General Motors, "is probably the best book to read if you want to read only one book about business." And if you want to read only one book about Sloan, that book should be historian David Farber's Sloan Rules.Here, for the first time, is a study of both the difficult man and the pathbreaking executive. Sloan Rules reveals the GM genius as not only a driven manager of men, machines, money, and markets but also a passionate and not always wise participant in the great events of his day. Sloan, for example, reviled Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal; he firmly believed that politicians, government bureaucrats, and union leaders knew next to nothing about the workings of the new consumer economy, and he did his best to stop them from intervening in the private enterprise system. He was instrumental in transforming GM from the country's largest producer of cars into the mainstay of America's "Arsenal of Democracy" during World War II; after the war, he bet GM's future on renewed American prosperity and helped lead the country into a period of economic abundance. Through his business genius, his sometimes myopic social vision, and his vast fortune, Sloan was an architect of the corporate-dominated global society we live in today.David Farber's story of America's first corporate genius is biography of the highest order, a portrait of an extraordinarily compelling and skillful man who shaped his era and ours.

Even before his youth had ended, he strained to begin his work. The eldest of ﬁve children, Sloan was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on May 23, 1875. His father, Alfred P. Sloan Sr., was then twenty-ﬁve, his mother twenty-three. They were originally from upstate New York, where their respective families were "old" and respectable, but not well-to-do. Mrs. Sloan's father had been a Methodist Episcopal minister (the Sloans, but not their eldest son, maintained a close association with the denomination until their deaths). Sloan Sr.'s father had been a private school master. But when his father sickened, Alfred Sr. was forced to leave school early and make his way in the world. This he did; by the time Alfred Jr. was born, his father was already a successful merchant, purveying tea, cigars, and coffee. Primarily, he imported coffee beans, which he roasted, ground, and blended, and then sold them wholesale.     By the time young Alfred was eleven years of age, Bennett, Sloan, and Company was a two-story concern located at 100 Hudson Street in lower Manhattan. The success of the business founded in New Haven had brought Sloan Sr. and his partner to New York City in 1885. The company prospered and Sloan grew up in a large brownstone at 240 Garﬁeld Place in a relatively fashionable part of Brooklyn.      Soon after moving to Brooklyn, Alfred began attending the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, which educated boys in what was then called "mechanics," or the practical sciences, much to young Alfred's delight. He was an outstanding student who relished book learning. Most of the boys in his neighborhood spent their afternoons out on the streets, teasing the iceman's horse or playing ball, "ﬂipping" on and off wagons or hustling nickels sellingnewspapers (in 1890, two-thirds of newspapers were sold by newsboysand a few newsgirls, as wellin the late afternoon). In his own accounts of his youth, Sloan states that he went straight home from school and spent his after-school hours avidly working through his text books.      While Sloan would never display any nostalgic interest in his Brooklyn youthor ever mention any particular feelings he may have had about moving from New Haven to New Yorkhe did retain throughout his life a distinct Brooklyn accent, which others often found surprising on ﬁrst hearing. He had a somewhat reedy, tenor voice and his speech was marked with such Brooklynese as "foist" for ﬁrst and "woik" for work. Since neither of his parents were Brooklyn natives, the heaviness of Sloan's accent suggests that he spent more time than he later admitted outside his home playing with other children and exploring his neighborhood.      In the only published photograph from Alfred Sloan's boyhood he sits astride a high-wheel bicycle, probably an 1886 Columbia Light Roadster. Sloan, in later life, always carefully crafted his self-image for public consumption and it is likely that he provided the photo himself, ﬁrst published in a 1938 Fortune magazine proﬁle, to reveal his early interest in the wheeled technology that directly contributed to his own industrial career: the photo was captioned "Young Alfred, astride the mechanical marvel of his age, had already chosen his career." Whatever Sloan's intent, the photo of a cocksure boy high atop his spectacular bicycleif it was a Columbia bicycle it cost upwards of $120 at a time when the U.S. per capita income was under $200reveals that he was never as one-dimensional a ﬁgure as his own accounts, even of his boyhood, always suggested.      Whether or not Alfred was a more playful child than he later wished others to know, by the time he was a teenager he was clearly eager to move forward and put childhood behind him. Sloan had decided that he wanted to be an engineer, a profession of relatively recent vintage. At age seventeen, he attempted to enroll at the Columbia University School of Mines. Despite easily passing the entrance exams, he was told he was too young to matriculate. Probably after some independent investigation, he turned to the more distant Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, which saw his age as no impediment. His father had the money to send Sloan to MIT and support him there.      In 1891, the year before Sloan matriculated at MIT, and only thirty years after the school's establishment, the institute's president Francis Amasa Walker had told his fellow educators that "in the schools of applied science and technology is to be found the perfection of education for young men."      Sloan wanted just such an education. He expected the work to be difﬁcult and he intended to devote himself to it with a singular dedication. Further, he decided early on that he would compound the challenge of MIT's program of studies by completing the four-year program in three years. Sloan saw his university days as a training ground for professional activities, not as some adventure in self-discovery or youthful pleasures. As Sloan remembered almost a half a century later, "I had been a grind. I had worked every possible minute, so that I might be graduated a year ahead, with the class of 1895." Sloan succeeded. He graduated from, arguably, the ﬁnest technology program in the nation in just three years. He had led his class in calculus, receiving a perfect score of 100 in his freshman year. He had also excelled in thermodynamics, in which he received a near perfect semester average of 98. Not all went so well for Sloan during his MIT days. In his courses in literature and history, which the school required, he did far worse; receiving three D's and two C's. Many decades later, Sloan forgot, or more likely chose to ignore at least temporarily, that he had ever taken such frustrating courses. He told an associate, "When I went to M.I.T. I did not have a single course in English, to say nothing of a single course in literature. I did not have a course in economics or in sociology or in history, to say nothing of broader courses than that." Sloan concluded: "I had a very narrow technical education.. . . For that reason and probably for inherent reasons, I am a very narrow man."      MIT's president in the 1890s, Francis Amasa Walker, would have been disappointed with Sloan's harsh self-assessment (and of his recollection of what courses he had actually taken). President Walker had hoped that requiring humanities courses, with "their liberalizing tendencies," would combine with "the work of the sciences in making the pupils exact and strong." Undoubtedly, Sloan believed he had achieved exactitude in his studies, and even a certain kind of mental strength. Cultural interests, however, did not stem naturally from his exposure to them. To go for the moment far ahead in this unfolding story, throughout his long life Alfred Sloan nearly never read for pleasure or voluntarily attended cultural performances of any kind. The MIT curriculum, whatever Sloan chose to remember or say in retrospect, was not to blame for this antipathy to works of literature or the creative arts.      Sloan received a bachelor of science in electricity, a ﬁeld of study added to the curriculum at MIT only in 1882 but which was by the mid-1890s the most popular major at the school. Electrical engineering was, then, still in its infancy. Sloan worked on equipment donated by Thomas Edison just before his arrival. Like Edison, Sloan did not see himself as a lone genius preparing for a lifetime of creative breakthroughs. He would be a scientiﬁcally trained technical problem solver prepared for coordinated work on practical concerns. Alfred Sloan had become an electrical engineer, like most of his cohort, to take a corporate position in America's world-leading industrial sector. The MIT classes of the 1890s were memorable ones. By the early 1920s, institute alumni ran General Motors, General Electric, Goodyear, and Du Pont. The engineering minddisciplined, logical, and methodicalﬁt perfectly the needs of America's evolving business corporations.      When he graduated in 1895, Sloan expected that his training would afford him the opportunity to take a respectable place in an industrial enterprise. At the end of the nineteenth century, in the United States as elsewhere in the world that mattered to Alfred Sloan, it was in industry that opportunity for achievement lay. A position within an industrial enterprise, he believed, would allow him to demonstrate his abilities, make his way, and advance rapidly. The meaning and nature of that success were subjects about which Sloan made no internal queries; his mind, at least as he and others have revealed it, did not turn in those sorts of direction. Sloan, just twenty years of age when he left MIT, was already a man of some certainties.      The Great Depression, the era that will ﬁgure so centrally in this story, could not have been a huge shock to Alfred Sloan Jr. He had been born just after the horrendous Panic of 1873, and when he graduated from MIT in 1895, the American economy was still reeling from the 1893 depression, the worst the nation had yet suffered. As the economy contracted in 1893, some six hundred banks and more than ﬁfteen thousand businesses dissolved. Farmers were hit especially hard, and for the ﬁrst time in the nation's history tens of thousands of tramps, most of them farm laborers, wandered the countryside in search of food. In the urban industrial centers, employers had to let go as many as one quarter of all unskilled, industrial workers.      Sloan followed the effects of the struggling economy in the Boston newspapers. He knew and almost certainly disapproved of William Jennings Bryant's inﬂationary demands for the coinage of silver to increase the money supply and so ease farmers' perilous economic plight. And he read with interest the daily press reports tracking the progress of the so-called Coxey's Army of unemployed men, which made its way by rail and road to Washington, D.C. to wage the ﬁrst national political campaign against unemployment. In 1894, about ten thousand of the unemployed, most of them in small groups from the far Northwest, California, New England, the Middle West, and the Rocky Mountain states marched on the nation's capital to present a "petition in boots." They wanted Congress to provide a national public works program until private employment again became possible. The largest group, perhaps a thousand men, called themselves "Coxey's Army" after their radical leader Jacob Coxey, a successful Ohio businessman, who insisted that a humanitarian concern for the less fortunate and the new industrial order could be reconciled through government action. The marchers succeeded in capturing the nation's interest but received no hearing from Congress. Coxey was jailed for twenty days for "illegally carrying banners" and for walking on the grass. In the mid-1890s the federal government provided the general citizenry with less than $5 million a year for all social welfare, health, and security programs. The business cycle, while little analyzed, was understood by most men of the capitalist class to be an unfortunate but regular part of the workings of the modern economy.      For Sloan, this downward turn was not merely a story in the newspapers. He could not ﬁnd a job. He spent a few months after his graduation working with one of his professors on engineering projects but nothing developed from it. When he began looking in earnest for a regular position in late 1895, Alfred Sloan, who had graduated MIT in three years, was turned down by every employer he contacted. Many industrial ﬁrms still distrusted university-educated menfew of the older generation of industrialists had received a higher educationand engineering positions of any kind, following the 1893 downturn, were in short supply. In Sloan's understated way he once allowed that the year after he graduated college was an unhappy time for him, "the most discouraging point of my whole life." He was forced to look inward and ask himself, "Where did I ﬁt into the American economy, what could I do?"      Sloan, remember, was only twenty years old when he ﬁnished with MIT, the youngest member of his graduating class. Forced leisure did not, however, encourage in him some desire to travel or to pursue adventure. Like most young, professional men of his time, he had no interest in fostering his personality through some course of self-discovery. Such emphasis on the rewards of personal development would not become commonplace for another quarter of a century. Sloan wished only to ﬁnd opportunity for the talent and training he had developed at MIT. A favorite adage (like many American businessmenfrom Benjamin Franklin through the present daySloan did produce and adhere to certain adages) expressed his outlook and goal: "Everyone of us has a certain talent in a certain direction and in other directions we may be completely devoid of talent." It is essential, he would say, to ﬁgure out your talent, for "that way work becomes a pleasure and not a drudgery." That Sloan would simply assume that any talent worthy of being so described would be work-directed indicates a fundamental aspect of his social outlook. Sloan's talent, so well proven at MIT, was in mastering, and even exceeding, the demands of institutional structures.      Sloan needed a position, a place in an organization from which he could direct his immense capacity for focused work in problem solving. Without such an organization, he was without purpose. In another rare allowance of personal feeling, Sloan would note, "as I was naturally of a serious turn of mind, I suppose I was more than ordinarily troubled when I failed to ﬁnd work at any of the places where I applied." No evidence exists suggesting that Sloan's inability to ﬁnd a position despite his superior qualiﬁcations during a time of market contraction caused him to regard the free enterprise system with any disfavor. In the account of his employment troubles, just quoted, which was written at the end of the Great Depression, Sloan managed to interject the ﬁrst-person pronoun ﬁve times in one sentence to make it clear that he blames no one and nothing for his difﬁculties except himself, emphasizing: "I failed to ﬁnd work." Whether or not Sloan accurately recalls what he felt at the time, he does admit to being deeply depressed in late 1895. The damaged economy thwarted him and he did not know what to do.      After some months of this unhappiness, his father, ﬁnally, was able to help. Sloan Sr. was well acquainted with one of Brooklyn's richest men, John E. Searles of the American Sugar Reﬁning Company. Their friendship extended back to the beginnings of their respective business pursuits in New Haven and had been renewed at the Methodist Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, where both men played an active role. Searles agreed to meet Sloan's son and see what he could do for him.      The meeting was brief. Sloan was shy at ﬁrst, as was his nature, but was soon put at ease by Searles' kind and courteous demeanor. Searles, whose business made him an experienced judge of character and ability, recognized what youngAlfred had to offer. Sloan left the meeting with a position in one of Searles' smaller companies. His career was launched.      Sloan never, in later years, pretended his entrance into the business world to be anything other than it was. He was of a new breed. He was born not into great wealth, nor was he a "self-made man." His was no Horatio Alger story. (Sloan would later use the term "Alger-boy" to refer to the self-made.) He came from a respectable, upper-middle-class, white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant family. His father's connections, coupled to his excellent education and obvious talent, proved out over time. Sloan's "hardest problem," ﬁnding out where he "ﬁt into the American economy," had been solved and his timein retrospect, a very brief timeof great disappointment had come to a close.      Sloan's career did not, at ﬁrst, seem to be on a meteoric course. The position that Searles had provided for him was the relatively humble post of draftsman. Young Alfred probably did not mention to Searles that the worst grade he had received at MITan Fhad been in drawing. Sloan was employed at a small factory, the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company, a ﬂedgling company in which Searles had the major interest. Hyatt was, itself, a humble concern, which moved from gritty Newark to the even less glamorous Harrison, New Jersey shortly after Sloan began work. Its operations were composed of a single building: a dirty, shack-like structure. Its nearest neighbor was a sprawling junkyard ﬁlled with rusting, obsolete machinery. Indicative of its status, Hyatt was sited on low ground, so that when it rained the unpaved grounds surrounding the factory became a sea of mud.      Hyatt manufactured a new sort of antifriction roller bearing. This bearing served to increase energy efﬁciency and thus decrease energy expenditures by reducing the frictional pressures on the line shafting that still turned most of the industrial machines then in use in the United States this being just prior to the use of electric motors in such machinery. (One can still view how industrial machinery was turned by line shafting at the textile factories preserved as museums in the old mill towns of Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts.) The bearing had been ﬁrst used in Searles' sugar grinders.      The Hyatt roller bearing had been invented by John Wesley Hyatt, an old-school inventor, largely self-taught and unsophisticated in scientiﬁc methods and theory. Despite his formal shortcomings, Hyatt was one of the most productive independent inventors of the nineteenth century. His breakthrough had come in 1869 when a shortage of elephant tusks had induced a New York City billiard ball manufacturer to offer a prize of ten thousand dollars for a synthetic billiard ball. Hyatt had combined pyroxylin (a volatile nitrocellulose substance) with camphor to make his plastine ball. In a small shop, Hyatt churned out other ingenious materials including a much improved, hardened wood for golf club heads. The roller bearing that bore its inventor's name (developed from the same lathe that Hyatt had invented to produce the synthetic billiard balls) had a decided advantage over competitive products for one simple reason: it was made of coiled steel tubing that gave it a springy quality and thus, as Sloan wrote some years later, "yielded to irregularities caused by poor manufacture, thus making automatic adjustments between housing and bearing."      It is worth emphasizing, given Sloan's subsequent career, that the Hyatt bearing was needed because machined parts in the late nineteenth century had not yet, as a matter of course, been engineered to ﬁne tolerances. As a result, the ﬂexibility of the Hyatt roller bearing made it an excellent product for the time. But as Sloan understood almost immediately, despite his lowly position and youth, the company was poorly run and so incapable of capitalizing its opportunities. At best, the company, with its twenty-ﬁve or so employees, was averaging two thousand dollars a month in sales. Sloan was paid ﬁfty dollars monthly and he quickly observed that the payroll was quite often being met only because Mr. Searles subsidized it. The business was a money loser.      Sloan became friendly with the company's young bookkeeper, a Norwegian immigrant named Peter Steenstrup. Over lunches at the nearest eatery, they discussed the means by which Hyatt could be made into a proﬁtable business. The talk was idle as no one in authority had the least interest in their viewpoint. Sloan was frustrated. His talents were being wasted and he was impatient to move forward in the world. He desired to be married to a women he had been courting since his days at MIT, Irene Jackson of Roxbury, Massachusetts (although where he found the time to meet and then court Miss Jackson remains a great mystery given his work habits both in college and on the job). In Sloan's mind, marriage was impossible until he had achieved a more respectable economic status.      In 1897, Sloan left Hyatt. In a rare but not unique move, he took a gamble on an unproven invention, an electric refrigeration unit being developed by Lieutenant Michael E. Wood of the U.S. Navy. Wood, no longer a young man, was an inveterate inventor, trained some years earlier at the Naval Academy, one of the nation's ﬁrst institutions to professionally educate engineers. He was sure he had ﬁnally come up with a winning technology and his enthusiasm was contagious. Wood had started a company to manufacture and install his refrigeration units in large apartment houses and hotels. As he explained to Sloan, the main refrigeration machinery would be located in a building's basement. Cold brine would then be pumped to individual boxes lined with copper coils that in turn would chill the box's contents and, incredibly, also supply icy-cold running water. A rich Bostonian had provided the start-up capital.      Sloan was charged with designing the system's circulating system and with managing sales. That the shy Sloan, completely unsuited to backslapping and glad-handing, had been given salesman duties, indicates how shaky were the enterprise's foundations. Wood called his brainchild the Hygienic Refrigeration Company. As Sloan recalled many years later, "I was a kid, infected with Lieutenant Wood's blind faith." Sloan was just twenty-two years old. From his experiences with the Hygienic Refrigeration Company, he would learn to trust even more in his dispassionate nature.      Like so many other new, technology-based companies, then and now, the business was not a success. Many were interested in the idea but the system was quite expensive. Worse, it frequently broke down. Even so, Sloan threw himself into the work. The enterprise was exciting, demanding of his talents, and provided, at ﬁrst, a good income.      Based on his faulty expectations of a reasonable economic future with Hygienic, Sloan married Irene Jackson on September 28, 1898. We do not know if the couple were giddy with love or as sober in private as they always appeared in their relatively rare public appearances in later years. Separated as they were for nearly three years, one assumes they corresponded, and perhaps they phoned one another despite the cost and the relatively poor quality of long distance transmissions. No record exists. Images of the courting Sloan, the young man in love, died with him.      All that remains of the Sloans from their ﬁrst year of marriage is a single photograph made sometime during the spring or early summer of 1899. Like so much else that Sloan left for others to ponder, it is a conventionalized image. The newlyweds are pictured with Alfred's family. Alfred Sr. is at the center of the family arrangement, holding his youngest child Raymond in his lap. He maintains the six year old's attention with a picture book. Alfred Jr. sits at his father's right hand, looking quite composed in a cane-backed rocking chair. He stares, as was his way all through life, with a ﬁxed, unemotional gaze at the cameraa typical pose for a young man of his status at the end of the nineteenth century (the camera's slow shutter speed contributed to such stiff-looking poses). The only person standing in the family photo is Irene. She is all in white, positioned behind her husband, her arm on his chair but not touching him. Perhaps it is a not the best picture of her; she appears to have a very long nose on a small face. Her dark hair is neatly tied behind her head in a bun. Like her mother-in-law, she hints at a smile.      We know, at the very least, that Sloan did love his bride, at least in his own reserved way. In the same year of her death in 1956, Sloan would break down before the man, Warren Weaver, he wished to appoint to the presidency of the Sloan Foundation. Weaver had just told Sloan that he would seriously consider the presidency of the foundation but only if he not be asked to make extensive business travels. He explained that in his previous position with the Rockefeller Foundation he had been forced to spend too much time away from his wife. The eighty-one-year-old Sloan responded: "If I ever ask you to do anything that limits your companionship with your wife, you just tell me to go to hell. I understand completely. For many years I was too completely absorbed in my business. I always said that I would cut down on this, and spend more time with my wife. But Warren, I waited too long." At this point, Sloan, a man who, aside from the perfunctory and brief handshake, almost never physically touched anyone, at least in public, put his arm across Weaver's shoulders as tears rolled down his cheeks. Sloan undoubtedly loved Irene, even if he chose not to show that affection publicly and rarely found the time to demonstrate it privately.      Sloan would remain married to Irene Jackson Sloan for the next ﬁfty-eight years. According to one late-in-life acquaintance, Mr. and Mrs. Sloan wished to have children but they were unable to do so. Whether they considered adopting a son or a daughter is unknown. No child would ever be theirs. Sloan's longlife would not be colored by children or childish ways, though Sloan did have a great affection for his youngest brother, Raymond, his junior by eighteen years. Family life, as a rule, did not much touch the inner life or daily routine of Alfred Sloan. Though the available evidence indicates that he believed himself to be in love with his wife, even that union, as Sloan confessed, had little impact on his devotion to his work commitments. In 1941, Sloan dedicated his publicity driven autobiography, in which his personal life ﬁgures almost not at all, to "I.J.S. My partner in the enterprise." It was for Sloan a rare touch of the ironic that only highlighted the obviousIrene had nothing at all to do with the enterprise that consumed Sloan's time and energies. For Sloan, work would always come ﬁrst.      Soon after his marriage, the Hygienic Refrigeration Company dissolved. Wood had died. Sloan, by this time less than pleased with the com-pany's founding genius, seems not to have been moved by his demise. Luckily, even as the refrigeration enterprise went under, an opportunity had arisen. John Searles, the man who had given Sloan his start, was fed up with the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company. Facing some personal ﬁnancial difﬁcultieshe was soon to go broke, not unusual for backers of new technologieshe wished to sell the money-losing enterprise.      At the younger Alfred's urging, Alfred Sloan Sr. and an associate agreed to buy Searles out for ﬁve thousand dollars. Sloan Sr. further agreed to supply capital, at least for a period of six months, until the business was proﬁtable. He clearly made this investment for his son: just twenty-three years old, Alfred Sloan Jr. was put in charge of the Hyatt Roller Bearing Company. Over time, he would accumulate a large equity interest in the business. His right-hand man was Peter Steenstrup. The lunchtime discussions the two had enjoyed little more than a year earlier were to be put to the test.      Within six months, the company was turned around. While Steenstrup relentlessly pursued new sales opportunities, Sloan completely reorganized production to achieve far greater cost efﬁciency and product reliability. Sloan spent the ﬁrst four years working at least ten hours a day, six days a week, week after week after week. He took no vacations. For the next eighteen years, Sloan ran the company. Under his direction, Hyatt became an extraordinary success, quickly outgrowing its one, shacklike building to become an expansive, modern industrial complex. This success was due to Sloan's correct assessment that Hyatt should direct its efforts toward integrating its products with the nascent auto industry.      The auto industry at the end of the nineteenth century was pure ﬂux and partial whimsy. It was hundreds of men tinkering in barns, garages, and dirt-ﬂoored machine shops. Carriage makers, buggy builders, bicycle mechanics, wagon wheel manufacturers, machine parts makers, and an exotic melange of undercapitalized entrepreneurs wrestled with the possibilities of manufacturing an auto-mobile, a self-propelled vehicle, a machine that moved itself under the control of its human operator.      It was a time of technological and cultural free play in which a machine and basic ways of living, working, playing, and courting were on the verge of being integrated in unanticipated ways. In terms of its sociohistorical development, the United States had entered a liminal zone, a threshold between two cultural landscapes. The English language itselfwith much borrowing from the French (chassis, limousine, garage, chauffeur, automobile)would have to be squeezed and reshaped in order to build a vocabulary that could incorporate the construction of a way of being in the worldriding in an autoanticipated by other modes of transport but fully realized by none other. Given the right kind of imagination, it was a fantastic historic moment.      In the year 1900, few in the United States envisioned a mass market for the gasoline-powered road car. Only about ﬁfteen hundred such cars were produced that year (whereas Manhattan alone had over 130,000 horses working the streets; or, put another way, more than ten times as many horses died in New York City as there were new autos with internal combustion engines built in the entire country). Wealthy sports, most of them urbanites, drove the tiny automobile market (though increasingly, rural doctors were buying cars as well). The high-priced machines were amusingly, if at times painfully, unreliable. Still, an aura surrounded this technological phenomena. The aura glistened green. Money, possibly a great deal of money, could be made in this new world. Few, of course, saw this opportunity. Horse manure still seemed a more likely growth industry (one more equine fact to ponder: New York City horses excreted roughly one million pounds of manure a day). As a result, the industry for the most part was not developed by major corporations, which generally were unwilling to take on the high risks associated with technological experimentation unrelated to their ongoing businesses. Instead auto enthusiasts, small-time investors, and a mixed bagof mechanically gifted men willing to gamble in exchange for the main chance, struggled to make automobiles. Scores of workshops and small companies hammered out the parts and accessories that would be painstakingly assembled into a working vehicle by dozens of competing automakers, each of whom fought off creditors and cash ﬂow problems in the furious rush to manufacture a breakthrough machine.      Sloan did not in a leap of imagination picture the possibilities created by the small-time automakers. He was approached by them. At least that is how Sloan, in his self-deprecating manner, tells the story, though he alludes to the fact that he and his associate, Mr. Steenstrup, were aggressively looking for new markets for their product. They knew that roller bearings for machine line shafting, due to the increasingly common use of electric engines, were about to become technologically obsolete. Hyatt bearings, or at least some manufacturer's bearings, were needed by the automakers to make car wheels turn efﬁciently on their axles.      Hyatt was ﬁrst approached about supplying auto wheel bearings in 1899 by Elwood Haynes, producer of Haynes Apperson cars in Kokomo, Indiana. Haynes, as Sloan described him some years later, was the quintessential rube, sophisticated about nothing but the possibilities of the automobile. Sloan also seems to have found it quite amusing that Haynes and his nascent auto works was based in the booming, alliterative metropolis of Kokomo, Indiana. In fact, Haynes was an extraordinarily accomplished American engineer, with degrees from both Worcester Polytechnic Institute and Johns Hopkins University, who had mastered German in order to follow the pathbreaking automotive work of Gottfried Daimler and Karl Benz. Sloan was a New Yorker, and despite Haynes's ﬁrst-rate East Coast education, technical training, linguistic gifts, and proven talents, the Kokomo-based Haynes might well have appeared to Sloan as a provincial yokel. Or more likely, in his postNew Deal, 1941 description of Haynes and the advent of the auto industry, Sloan aimed to make a point about the low-cost entry, free-market creativity at work in those ﬁrst days of the auto business.      While Sloan himself would soon enough do his best to ensure that the auto industry itself would become a very high-cost entry business, he took pains in his own account of his early years to tell his tale of Elwood Haynes of Kokomo, and other "rather simple people," to convince the democratic citizenry that the free market enables economic creativity in the most unexpected places by the most unexpected people. It was Alfred P. Sloan's ﬁrm belief, one which he wanted all Americans to fully appreciate, that no government planner could ever anticipate the vitality of individual Americans free to pursue their dreams of proﬁtable accomplishment. Of course, such thoughts were, in the early years of the twentieth century, not yet in Sloan's ken. It would take the political turmoil of the 1930s to turn his mind in such an unwelcome direction.      In the ﬁrst years of the automobile age, Sloan and his Hyatt associate, Peter Steenstrup, became industry ﬁxtures. Steenstrup was the ﬁeld man. He visited every manufacturer and set up shop at every trade show. Steen-strup's mission was simple, but as any sales representative knows, not easy. His responsibility was to identify and to win the trust of the many men in the highly volatile auto business who had the responsibility for buying parts for their company's machines. Steenstrup had to be the hail-fellow-well-met who got Hyatt in the door. Sloan, then, would ﬁgure out how to design Hyatt bearings into the auto manufacturer's assemblage.      Through trade show excursions and factory visits, Sloan, too, met most everyone of signiﬁcance in the auto industry. In his own recollections of those early days in the auto parts business, Sloan credited many individuals with providing him with life-long business lessons. One of the ﬁrst and most important of these lessons came from Henry Leland, general manager of Cadillac, then an independent automaker. Sloan received this lesson ﬁrsthand after Leland rejected the ﬁrst shipment of bearings Hyatt had sent Cadillac. The contract was vitally important to Hyatt's short-term proﬁtability and even more essential to the company's reputation for reliability in the infant auto industry. Sloan rushed by train from New York to Detroit in an attempt to salvage the contract. In his ofﬁce, Leland, a large, bearded gentleman of Old Testament rages, showed Sloan the facts. Bearings in hand and his anger still on call, Leland demonstrated that the Hyatt product, despite salesman Steenstrup's assurances, did not meet Cadillac's required parameters: accuracy within a thousandth of an inch. Sloan, though speaking "as softly" as he could, did at ﬁrst attempt to explain away the difﬁculty. After Leland angrily interrupted him, however, Sloan stopped defending his company and listened. Leland explained the necessity of manufacturing precisely engineered interchangeable parts. "Mr. Sloan," he roared, "Cadillacs are made to run, not just to sell." Sloan understood. He agreed. He asked Leland's advice. From then on, he would do better: "I was determined to be as fanatical as he in obtaining precision in our work. An entirely different standard had been established for Hyatt Roller Bearings."      One of Sloan's many strengths was his ability to hear others out dispassionately. If the facts, as he understood them, bore out he could and did shift his perspective. Given his later political difﬁculties, it is worth emphasizing the other side of this character trait. If Sloan did not believe the facts bore out or if facts, as he perceived them, were not being given their due, Sloan could become quite recalcitrant and even emotionally explosive. Such times were rare. Leland spoke in a language Sloan understood and Sloan's postgraduate work in manufacturing advanced signiﬁcantly as a result.      One other character trait worth noting is revealed in the Leland anecdote. Sloan, as both a young man and a man of middle age, was skilled at working with men older than himself as well as with men of his own generation. This ability was amply demonstrated in his ﬁrst years with Hyatt when he had sought out old John Wesley Hyatt, in his inventor's shop, and plied him with questions about roller ball bearings. Leland, too, was a man of an altogether different generation and set of experiences (including, Leland believed, a personal visitation from God), but Sloan developed a strong working relationship with him. Leland was an engineer of the old school of practical experience; he had received his start as a toolmaker for a federal arsenal during the Civil War. In Sloan's eyes, however, Leland was always "an elder, not only in age but in engineering wisdom."      Sloan had a gift that is rare in young men: the ability to learn from one's elders and to seek their counsel. In establishing such relations, Sloan also bore out an old organizational adage to the effect that seeking help and counsel from those one admires generally brings support and concern from the sought after for the seeker. For Sloan, later in his life, a major problem would be the lack of anyone from whom he felt he could learn. In the world he respected, few people seemed to be his equal, let alone his superior. He would retain his gift for listening to the facts and admitting his own mistaken viewpoints, but what he lost was his ability to rethink fundamentals based on advice or instruction from others.      Sloan was a regular at the yearly auto shows which began in 1900 (ﬁve, in fact, were held that year, all claiming to be the ﬁrst). By the 1906 auto show, Hyatt passed out brochures advertising the "Hyatt Improved Self Oiling Self Contained Bearing with Removable Inside and Outside Casings." Sloan wrote the copy for the brochure, which reveals something of the state of advertising in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century as well as of the directions Sloan's talents did and did not point: "The prospective purchaser of a motor car must be satisﬁed upon three vital points before he can possibly be induced to invest.. . . The car must have all the power that is required: it must be built so that it may easily be taken care of; and it must be constructed in such a manner that the driver may be reasonably sure of getting back home." Any humor found in this ad is wholly the work of the reader, not the writer of the copy.      During the auto shows, Steenstrup would rope in the multitudes of car enthusiasts, master auto mechanics, and pioneering adventurers in the motor business and herd them over to the Hyatt booth. Sloan waited for them there. Henry Ford and Alfred Sloan ﬁrst met at the Hyatt booth, probably in 1901, when Ford was working on the racing car that would soon thereafter bring him his ﬁrst fame. Ford and Sloan, we only know, watched together from the gallery of Madison Square Garden as the earliest American auto manufacturers ran their carsoften one-of-a-kind modelsaround a track set up on the ﬂoor of the hall.

Item Description: Peter Lang Publishing Inc, United States, 2003. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. The Conservative Sixties tells the other story of America in the era of left-wing protests, countercultural experiments, and a civil rights revolution. Ten original historical essays focus on Phyllis Schlafly, Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater, the John Birch Society, the Minutemen, Moral Mothers and Goldwater Girls, Cowboy Conservatives, National Politics versus Community Interest, Below-the-Belt Politics, and the Politics of Law and Order. The Conservative Sixties demonstrates that throughout the 1960s, right-wing activists organized at the grass-roots, re-thought their priorities, discovered new allies, and prepared to defeat liberals in the political and cultural arenas. This history of the 1960s puts the presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George H. Bush, and George W. Bush - as well as the conservative turn of Congress and the American people - into historical perspective.  Bookseller Inventory # AAZ9780820455488

Item Description: Peter Lang Aug 2003, 2003. Taschenbuch. Book Condition: Neu. Neuware - The Conservative Sixties tells 'the other story' of America in the era of left-wing protests, countercultural experiments, and a civil rights revolution. Ten original historical essays focus on Phyllis Schlafly, Ronald Reagan, Barry Goldwater, the John Birch Society, the Minutemen, 'Moral Mothers and Goldwater Girls', 'Cowboy Conservatives', 'National Politics versus Community Interest', 'Below-the-Belt Politics', and the 'Politics of Law and Order'. The Conservative Sixties demonstrates that throughout the 1960s, right-wing activists organized at the grass-roots, re-thought their priorities, discovered new allies, and prepared to defeat liberals in the political and cultural arenas. This history of the 1960s puts the presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George H. Bush, and George W. Bush - as well as the conservative turn of Congress and the American people - into historical perspective. 211 pp. Englisch.  Bookseller Inventory # 9780820455488
