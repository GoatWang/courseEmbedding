About risk
There are risks involved with investing in any such products, including the possible loss of principal. Investors in the Funds should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility and the possibility of significant losses.
Alternative investments are speculative, entail substantial risk and are not suitable for all clients. Alternative investments are intended for experienced and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high economic risks of the investment. Investments in absolute-return strategies are not intended to outperform stocks and bonds during strong market rallies. Hedge funds and hedge fund of funds can be highly volatile, carry substantial fees, and involve complex tax structures. Investments in these types of funds involve a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. Investments in derivatives often involve leverage, which may increase the volatility of the investment and may result in a loss.
As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Fund. The Fund’s Shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund does not represent a complete investment program.

About risk
There are risks involved with investing in any such products, including the possible loss of principal. Investors in the Funds should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility and the possibility of significant losses.

Investments in these types of funds involve a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. Investments in derivatives often involve leverage, which may increase the volatility of the investment and may result in a loss.
As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Fund. The Fund’s Shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund does not represent a complete investment program.

The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return and value of the Fund shares will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than performance data quoted. Fund returns reflect dividends and capital gains distributions. Index performance is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent actual Fund performance. One cannot invest directly in an index. Performance data for the Index assumes reinvestment of dividends and is net of the management fees for the Index's components, as applicable, but it does not reflect management fees, transaction costs or other expenses that you would pay if you invested in the Fund directly.
Before you invest: The Fund's investment performance, because it is a fund of funds, depends on the investment performance of the underlying ETFs in which it invests. There is no guarantee that the Fund itself, or any of the ETFs in the Fund's portfolio, will perform exactly as its underlying index. The Fund’s underlying ETFs invest in: foreign securities, which subject them to risk of loss not typically associated with domestic markets, such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty; commodities markets, which subject them to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds; and fixed income securities, which subject them to credit risk – the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and/or repay the principal on its debt – and interest rate risk – changes in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in interest rates. Leverage, including borrowing, will cause some of the Fund’s underlying ETFs to be more volatile than if the underlying ETFs had not been leveraged.
The IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Index is comprised solely of ETFs. The Index does not include hedge funds as components. Returns presented are net of underlying ETF fees, but do not reflect the deduction of management fees, taxes and other expenses.
Returns less than 1 year are cumulative; all other returns are annualized.
* Fund Inception Date: March 25, 2009. The Index and Fund performance since inception in the table above is based on the Fund inception date. The Index inception date is September 15, 2008.
1. IOPV, or Indicative Optimized Portfolio Value, is a calculation disseminated by the stock exchange that approximates the Fund's NAV every 15 seconds throughout the trading day.
2. As stated in the Fund's prospectus, the management fee is 0.75% and the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses is 0.96%, which includes (i) other Fund expenses and (ii) the Fund's pro rata share of fees and expenses incurred indirectly as a result of investing in other funds, including ETFs and money market funds. This amount will vary over time due to changes in the underlying ETF fees and expenses and the constitution of the Index.
The IQ Hedge Multi-Strategy Index is the exclusive property of IndexIQ which has contracted with Structured Solutions to maintain and calculate the Index.
IndexIQ shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Total Returns are calculated using the daily 4:00 pm ET net asset value (NAV). Market price returns reflect the share price as of the close of trading on the exchange where Fund shares are listed. Beginning on May 31, 2016, the price used to calculate the market price returns is the mean between the day’s last bid and ask prices. Prior to May 31, 2016, market price returns were calculated using the day’s closing price on the fund’s primary exchange. The market price returns do not represent returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.
There are differences between investing in bonds and investing in liquid alternative ETFs. A bond is a debt instrument in which an investor loans money to a corporate or government entity that borrows the funds for a specified period of time at a fixed interest rate. Investors typically receive interest on the bonds when they mature. Bond funds hold a portfolio of bonds and can differ widely in strategies, ranging from U.S. Treasuries to high yields, from long-term to short-term. By contract, liquid alternative ETFs typically hold many non-bond securities, but provide investors with many of the same attributes as bond investing, such as dividend yield, lower volatility, and tax efficiency in terms of reduced capital gains distributions.
Hedgeweek Award Methodology: Awards are based on a “peer review system” whereby Hedgeweek’s readers—including institutional and high net worth investors, managers and other industry professionals at fund administrators, prime brokers, custodians and advisers—are invited to elect a “best in class” in a series of categories via an online survey. For more information, visit hedgeweek.com/hedgeweek/awards/methodology.

About risk
There are risks involved with investing in any such products, including the possible loss of principal. Investors in the Funds should be willing to accept a high degree of volatility and the possibility of significant losses.
Alternative investments are speculative, entail substantial risk and are not suitable for all clients. Alternative investments are intended for experienced and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high economic risks of the investment. Investments in absolute-return strategies are not intended to outperform stocks and bonds during strong market rallies. Hedge funds and hedge fund of funds can be highly volatile, carry substantial fees, and involve complex tax structures. Investments in these types of funds involve a high degree of risk, including loss of entire capital. Investments in derivatives often involve leverage, which may increase the volatility of the investment and may result in a loss.
As with all investments, there are certain risks of investing in the Fund. The Fund’s Shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund does not represent a complete investment program.
