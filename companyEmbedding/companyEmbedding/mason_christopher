Christopher M. Mason







﻿














Chris Mason is a litigator well known for his extensive experience in class action defense, arbitration and complex financial disputes. He typically represents consumer products, technology, financial services, private equity or industrial companies in state or federal trial and appellate courts, in domestic arbitration and mediation or in regulatory inquiries. Chris also leads the firm’s Arbitration team of over 150 attorneys.
What do you focus on?
My primary goal as a lawyer is to help businesses manage the risks and outcomes of significant disputes. 
I have defended many large class or mass actions and prosecuted or defended significant cases in more than half of the states in the country, in numerous federal courts and before the American Arbitration Association, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution and FINRA. 

In the largest consumer class action in history, with over 200 million class members and minimum statutory damages of $500 billion to well over $1 trillion, I successfully represented a prominent data company that refused to settle when the others in its industry did. 
I have successfully resolved or defeated claims in multiple class actions in multiple jurisdictions for a leading provider of consumer information about used cars. 
I have handled many wireless telecommunications cases, including cases for each of the three largest carriers. I won the first appellate decision under New York law upholding class action waivers against claims of unconscionability and on appeal in the Fifth Circuit recently made new law as to whether governmental entities can be members of putative consumer classes. 
For a leading technology company, I eliminated both a mass action and a mass arbitration that threatened to disrupt its unique sales and distribution channels. 
For the world’s largest wine company, I settled a nationwide class action over millions of bottles of allegedly fraudulent wine, not only for less than seven figures, but for less than the settlement paid by the client’s major competitor. 
For several financial services clients, I have pioneered a unique jurisdictional technique in the resolution of certain kinds of disputes over structured products. 
For the world’s leading luxury jewelry brand, I won a seven figure award in a complex purchase price dispute arbitration. 

What do you see on the horizon?
Procedurally, the landscape on alternative dispute resolution is continuing to change. Having drafted some of the most widely used arbitration clauses in the country, I believe now is the time for many companies to reassess their contracts and dispute resolution programs.
Substantively, I see a resurgence in private antitrust theories, new emphasis on litigation over consumer products related to basic needs as opposed to products involving only discretionary spending (accompanied, however, by an evolving view of what is “basic”), constant risks with respect to the volume and use of data and a continuing need to simplify disputes over complex financial products for businesses.
Representative cases 

Ackal v. Centennial Beauregard Cellular, L.L.C., 700 F.3d 212 (5th Cir.). In a decision of first impression in any court, the Fifth Circuit reversed certification of a class in part because of inclusion of governmental entities as absent class members. Chris represented the successful defendants, subsidiaries of AT&T, in the trial court and on appeal. 
Merizon Grp. Inc. d/b/a Modern Bus. Mach. v. Canon U.S.A., Inc., No. 12 Civ. 2744 (LDW) (E.D.N.Y.). In this case, Chris represented former Canon office imaging equipment dealers suing for violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 2 of the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, and 13, as well as Iowa and Wisconsin state law, to secure access to necessary parts and supplies following termination. The case concluded successfully when the parts became available to the former dealers. 
Fresco v. R.L. Polk & Co., Case No. 07-60695-Civ-Martinez/Bandstra (S.D. Fla.). This case, settled for a modest amount of attorney’s fees, no economic relief to the plaintiffs, and an injunction on consent that, for the most part, simply codified the client’s existing internal controls, involved the defense of a nationwide class action for violation of federal statutory privacy protections brought against the oldest database company in the United States. The nature of the statute, the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2721-25, meant that the minimum statutory damages for the class probably exceeded $1 trillion. The class itself was probably the largest in history, comprising all persons in the United States who, at any time during more than a decade, had ever had a driver’s license. 
Davis v. Carfax, Inc., No. CJ-04-1316 L (Okla. Dist. Ct.), appeal dismissed, No. 103008 (Ok Sup. Ct.). In this case, Chris defeated class certification and won dismissal of a statewide class action asserting breach of contract and violation of consumer protection statutes. On appeal, the case was used as a vehicle to settle, on terms very favorable to the client, all claims in other parallel state court class actions commenced in California, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas. 
Digital Documents Store v. Xerox Corp., Case No. 72 155 Y 00474 08 JENF (AAA) and Elite v. Global Imaging Sys. Inc., No. BC379155 (Cal. Super. Ct.). Lead cases and arbitration of claims of over $1 billion for breach of contract, antirust or unfair competition, and misuse of confidential information by a large group of Xerox agents and dealers. Through pretrial proceedings, the various lawsuits were stayed or dismissed and the damages claimed in the arbitration were reduced many-fold. The remaining claimants settled their disputes on terms highly favorable to Xerox and its subsidiary, Global Imaging Systems, rather than continue any further. 
Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. as Trustee v. LaCrosse Fin. Prods., LLC, No. 08 CV 0955 (LAK) (S.D.N.Y.). In this, and other similar cases such as Deutsche Bank Trust Co. Ams. v. Elliot Int’l, L.P., No. 09 CV 5242 (WHP) (S.D.N.Y.), and U.S. Bank N.A. v. Black Diamond CLO 2005-1 Adviser, L.L.C., 11 Civ. 5675 (JSR) (S.D.N.Y.), Chris has pioneered the use of federal statutory interpleader in combination with a little-known federal lien enforcement statute to provide world-wide quasi in rem jurisdiction to resolve disputes over the interpretation of structured debt products involving hundreds of millions of dollars at a time. 
Morrissey v. Nextel Partners, Inc., Index No. 3194-06 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). In this case, a purported national class by disgruntled cellphone subscribers, Chris defeated national class certification in the trial court, and defeated all efforts on appeal at class certification except for the possibility of a partial class of New York-only customers—as to which there are almost no net damages that could be claimed. 
Orcutt v. Nat’l Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc., No. 6:12-CV-0513 (GTS/TWD) (N.D.N.Y.). This putative nationwide class action claiming violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act) ended in a voluntary dismissal by the individual plaintiffs without class certification. 
Zeller v. Constellation Brands, Inc., Case No. BC443338 (Cal. Super. Ct.). This is the lead case of several consumer class actions, triggered by fraud convictions in France against a number of wine sellers in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, involving claims of a proposed class of all United States purchasers of certain pinot noir wines from 2005 to 2008. The plaintiffs asserted that the wines were falsely labeled as pinot noir following the huge increase in demand for that varietal that occurred after the hit movie Sideways. After dismissal of several of the plaintiffs’ cases, the remaining case was settled for a very modest amount on a claims made basis. 
In re the Reserve Fund Secs. and Derivative Litig., 09 MD. 2011 (PGG) (S.D.N.Y.). In this case, Chris—after an initial flat denial—persuaded the trial court to reverse its initial decision 180 degrees and recalculate the client’s multimillion dollar entitlement to payment with respect to money fund redemptions in the infamous “break the buck” cases triggered by the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. 
Ranieri v. Bell Atl. Mobile, 304 A.D. 2d 353, 759 N.Y.S. 2d 448 (N.Y. App. Div. 1st Dep’t). In this significant decision, the court (with respect to an arbitration clause drafted by Chris), concluded that in New York “a contractual proscription against class actions” in a form consumer contract “is neither unconscionable nor violative of public policy.” 
D.S. Meyerson Assocs., Inc. v. Allen, No. 00 Civ. 5772 (S.D.N.Y.). In a unique role as settlement counsel after years of dispute and litigation by other lawyers, Chris achieved a swift and favorable settlement of all claims. 
Campbell v. AirTouch Cellular, Case No. GIC 751725 (Cal. Super. Ct.). In this case, at the time one of the largest class actions in history, Chris achieved a successful settlement covering multiple different class actions after several years of litigation. 
Miletich v. Bookmeier, Index No. 00/114972 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). Chris resolved this difficult shareholder derivative suit with a highly favorable settlement for the client. 
In re Cellco Consumer Litig., Master File No. L-9435-96 (N.J. Super. Ct.). Chris secured a dismissal after a number of years of litigation (including a successful decertification fight) of this multistate, consolidated consumer class action involving tens of millions of putative class members. 
Quick Page of New Jersey, Inc. v. Cellco P’ship, Case No. 13 494 00811 00 02 (AAA). In this case Chris won an arbitration award under the Lanham Act and other theories to enjoin advertising and infringing behavior by a former distributor. 
AXA Réassurance S.A. v. Chase Manhattan Bank, Index No. 99/121290 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). In this proceeding Chris won dismissal of all claims against a well-known motion picture producer, allowing the producer to pursue his own claims in arbitration. 
Federated Strategic Income Fund v. Mechala Grp. Jamaica Ltd., No. 99 Civ. 10517 (HB) (S.D.N.Y.). This case ended with Chris obtaining for the client an unprecedented injunction on Trust Indenture Act grounds against a tender offer for debt securities. 
Omnipoint Commc’ns, Inc. v. New York Yankee P’ship, Index No. 601910/97 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). Chris won summary judgment on all counts in this case involving substantial breach of contract and tortious interference claims for advertising in Yankee Stadium.

I bought this to hide the grandkids toys when they are not in use. But we also use it as a foot stool and sometimes as extra seating. The kids have no issues getting their things in and out of this storage container. Very happy with the purchase.

excellent
















Verified Purchase


Excellent and functional. Have been looking at these units for a long time and have no regrets. Kids will not bump their heads and be hurt, there is plenty of storage (love the compartments) and it functions as a coffee table, what else could one wish for. I can imagine this as a great apartment piece as well.

Great Ottoman
















Verified Purchase


I've had this ottoman for a few weeks now, and it's working out terrific. When I received it, the packaging was neat and tidy, and assembly (only the legs) was a snap. Being a woodworker myself, the quality is pretty darn good: there are no chips in the paint/wood for the trays and the material is stretched nicely with no waves. No complaints here.

Really nice
















Verified Purchase


This is exactly what I wanted for my living room and it's at a great price.  The storage spaces are larger than I expected.  I was hoping it would be big enough to store magazines, blankets, and video game accessories and it fits everything perfectly.  It is well made and I am very happy with it.

It is a deep chocolate brown. like espresso. If your recliner has a mixture of colors I think that it would go fine with your couch to add more depth and color.
