It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case. Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. Simplified: Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

(PRWEB)
July 17, 2017
 Whitehouse Laboratories is excited to announce that it has expanded its drug delivery device testing capabilities to encompass the full series of ISO 80369 standard test procedures. The ISO 80369 series of eight test standards provides comprehensive evaluations of fittings for medical device and drug delivery systems. With this recent expansion, Whitehouse Labs becomes one of the only facilities in the United States to provide compliance testing services for these standards.
“At the end of 2016, a full gamut of specifications and performance test methods were published by ISO to reduce the risk of misconnecting fittings in medical procedures. Through the design of connectors for specific procedures and applications, it is now very difficult for healthcare providers to physically connect delivery devices from one procedure to the next,” commented Mark Stier, Vice President, Global Analytical Sales and Business Development. “To meet the drug delivery device industry’s demand for testing of new fittings, Whitehouse Laboratories is now fully equipped to cover all eight standards with the required gauges and reference fittings to evaluate compliance to this series of test requirements and implement the latest standards in response to regulatory and customer demands."
“We will be delivering high precision compliance data under the well-established name and testing capabilities that Whitehouse Labs has provided for the medical device and pharmaceutical container closure industries," said Amanda Wohlleber, Whitehouse Labs General Manager. “With this testing capability, Whitehouse Labs has now created a ‘state-of-the-art’ workstation for drug delivery devices for compliance testing to the ISO 80369 series of standards.”

Financial Statements and Exhibits.


99.1
Excerpt from Lender Presentation dated July 10, 2017


Additional Information About the Proposed Transaction and Where to Find It 
This Current Report on Form 8-K does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval. AMRI has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as of July 3, 2017, and intends to file with the SEC and mail to its stockholders a definitive proxy statement in connection with the proposed transactions with Carlyle and GTCR. Security holders of AMRI are urged to read the definitive proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available because such materials will contain important information about AMRI, Carlyle and GTCR and their respective affiliates and the proposed transaction. The proxy statement and other relevant materials (when they become available), and any and all other documents filed by AMRI with the SEC, may be obtained free of charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
In addition, investors may obtain a free copy of AMRI’s filings from AMRI’s website at http://ir.amriglobal.com/ or by directing a request to: Albany Molecular Research, Inc., 26 Corporate Circle, Albany, New York 12203, attn: [email protected]
INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND THE OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING OR INVESTMENT DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION.
Participants in the Solicitation
AMRI and its directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the security holders of AMRI in connection with the proposed transaction. Information about those directors and executive officers of AMRI, including their ownership of AMRI securities, is set forth in the proxy statement for AMRI’s 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was filed with the SEC on April 19, 2017, as supplemented by other AMRI filings with the SEC, including the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC as of July 3, 2017. Investors and security holders may obtain additional information regarding the direct and indirect interests of AMRI and its directors and executive officers in the proposed transaction by reading the proxy statement and other public filings referred to above.
Forward-Looking Statements 
This report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the proposed Merger and the timing of the closing of the acquisition. The words “anticipates”, “believes”, “expects”, “may”, “plans”, “predicts”, “will”, “potential”, “goal” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. AMRI’s actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors, some of which AMRI may not be able to predict and may not be within AMRI’s control. Factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, (i) the risk that the proposed merger may not be completed in a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect AMRI's business and the price of its common stock, (ii) the failure to satisfy all of the closing conditions of the proposed merger, including the adoption of the Merger Agreement by AMRI's stockholders and the receipt of certain governmental and regulatory approvals in foreign jurisdictions, (iii) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the proposed merger on AMRI's business, operating results, and relationships with customers, suppliers, competitors and others, (v) risks that the proposed Merger may disrupt AMRI's current plans and business operations, (vi) potential difficulties retaining employees as a result of the proposed Merger, (vii) risks related to the diverting of management's attention from AMRI's ongoing business operations, and (viii) the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against AMRI related to the Merger Agreement or the proposed Merger. In addition, AMRI's actual performance and results may differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks including, without limitation: changes in customers’ spending and demand and the trends in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies’ outsourcing of manufacturing services and research and development; AMRI’s ability to provide quality and timely services and to compete with other companies providing similar services; AMRI’s ability to comply with strict regulatory requirements; AMRI’s ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions and to realize the expected benefits of each; disruptions in AMRI’s ability to source raw materials; a change in the AMRI’s relationships with its largest customers; AMRI’s ability to service its indebtedness; AMRI’s ability to protect its technology and proprietary information and the confidential information of its customers; AMRI’s ability to develop products of commercial value under its collaboration arrangements; the risk of patent infringement and other litigation; as well as those risks discussed in AMRI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017, subsequent Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC and AMRI’s other SEC filings. Numerous factors, including those noted above, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. AMRI expressly disclaims any current intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statement in this report to reflect future events or changes in facts affecting the forward-looking statements contained in this report.

Company history and acquisitions[edit]
Inaugurated in 1991 as Albany Molecular Research, Inc., AMRI was founded by Thomas E. D’Ambra, Ph.D. and Chester Opalka. Dr. D’Ambra continues to serve as chairman, president and CEO. As AMRI, the company has been a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ since 1999.[2] AMRI commenced operations with custom synthesis services in laboratory space provided by Siena College. Following this, the company expanded into laboratory space at the Wright Malta Corporation, which was located on the site where Global Foundries new computer chip fabrication plant is located.[3] After that, in early 1992, the company consolidated and expanded its operations into laboratory space at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Incubator Annex in Watervliet N.Y. By 1997, the company occupied laboratory space in the C-wing of the SUNY Albany East Campus, which was formerly the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute.[4] In 1999, through the purchase of Enzymed Inc. (Iowa City, IA), the company added biocatalysis capabilities[5] before, AMRI acquired American Advanced Organics, Inc. of Syracuse N.Y. in 2000.[6] In 2001, the company added natural product isolation and identification technology through the acquisition of New Chemical Entities of Bothell, WA.[7] In early 2001, AMRI began leasing space in 30 Corporate Circle, which was fitted out as discovery chemistry laboratory space. The company then purchased two buildings at 24 and 26 Corporate Circle. The original building at 26 was demolished. Construction on a new 26 Corporate Circle building began in November 2002 and AMRI’s new Corporate Headquarters was opened in April 2004.[8]
AMRI went on to establish offshore subsidiaries, which included the Albany Molecular Research Singapore Research Centre, Pte. Ltd., located in Singapore, and the Albany Molecular Research Hyderabad Research Centre, Pvt. Ltd., located in India (both in 2005).[9] AMRI acquired the Budapest operations of ComGenex in March 2006.[10] In May 2007, the company officially changed its name to AMRI and introduced a new company logo.[11] AMRI acquired a number of API and chemical intermediates manufacturing facilities from Ariane Orgachem in Aurangabad, India in 2008[12] then in 2010 AMRI completed the acquisition of Excelsyn in Holywell, U.K.[13] This facility underwent successful inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) in June 2011, and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January 2012 allowing for the production of registered intermediates and APIs for human use.[14] After this AMRI expanded into the aseptic fill and finish business, acquiring the parenteral dosage form manufacturing business Hyaluron, located in Burlington, Massachusetts (USA).[15] In early 2012, the company ended operations in Budapest, Hungary, moving most of the operations to the new parallel synthesis and purification laboratories Hyderabad facility.[16] In November 2012, AMRI announced that it would close the Bothell, Washington, site and would transition the sites biology capabilities to Singapore.[17] In December 2012, New York State announced plans to invest $50 million in biomedical research equipment and facilities and secured an agreement with AMRI to locate a new drug discovery R&D facility at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.[18][18] In December 2012, AMRI Rensselaer was awarded a $200,000 Empire State Development Corporation grant for the expansion of the diagnostic imaging agent project.[19]
AMRI completed an initial public offering in February 1999, raising $56.3 million and listing as AMRI on the Nasdaq.[20] The company also completed a secondary public offering in October 2000, generating further net proceeds of $119.5 million.[21] AMRI’s Allegra patent applications, from 1995, and the resulting patents were licensed to what is now Sanofi-Aventis. The company continues to receive royalties on the sale of Allegra and Telfast products globally.[22]
In June 2014, AMRI acquired OsoBio Pharmaceuticals, a contract manufacturer specializing in aseptic filling, for $110 million.[23]
In February 2015, AMRI acquired SSCI based in West Lafayette, Indiana. SSCI was founded in 1991, providing comprehensive cGMP solid state chemistry research and analytical services to the pharmaceutical industry. Servicing more than 250 customers a year, SSCI has an industry-leading reputation for solving difficult drug substance and formulated drug product challenges.[24][25]
In July 2015, the company acquired Gadea Pharmaceutical group for $174 million.[26]
In June 2017 management of AMRI and two private equity firms, The Carlyle Group and GTCR, agreed to sell AMRI to the firms for $21.75 per share, around $1.5 billion, taking the company private. AMRI was weighed down with debt from recent acquisitions and was struggling to make a profit; the arrangement awaited approval of shareholders and regulators.[27] This agreement was part of a burst of M&A activity in the CRO industry, with Lonza Group acquiring Capsugel for around $5.5 billion and Thermo Fisher Scientific buying Patheon for $7.2 billion.[27]
Scientific collaborations[edit]
In July 1997, AMRI received a $100,000 grant from the National Cancer Institute to “design and synthesize compounds that inhibit a class of enzymes responsible for regulation of the cell cycle”.[28] AMRI then extended a deal in 2001 with Pfizer for three additional years to “provide chemistry, research, development and analytical services”.[29] AMRI entered into a 3-year deal with Merck and Co. to “perform medicinal chemistry research and help design and synthesize compounds” in June 2002[8] before, in May 2004, AMRI was awarded a three-year contract to manufacture potential treatments for substance abuse by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.[30] In April 2007, AMRI took a lead role in a three-year, multidisciplinary research program, the CancerGrid Project, funded by the European Commission.[31] and went on to receive a multi-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract Award for the “development of pre-clinical drug candidates to treat diseases of the nervous system” in August 2011.[32]
In October 2012, AMRI announced a five-year extension of an API supply agreement with Shire for an undisclosed product.[33] In December 2012, AMRI announced a multi-year extension of a commercial supply relationship with GE Healthcare to provide Aminobisamide (ABA), a key intermediate used in several diagnostic imaging agents.[34]

Company history and acquisitions[edit]
Inaugurated in 1991 as Albany Molecular Research, Inc., AMRI was founded by Thomas E. D’Ambra, Ph.D. and Chester Opalka. Dr. D’Ambra continues to serve as chairman, president and CEO. As AMRI, the company has been a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ since 1999.[2] AMRI commenced operations with custom synthesis services in laboratory space provided by Siena College. Following this, the company expanded into laboratory space at the Wright Malta Corporation, which was located on the site where Global Foundries new computer chip fabrication plant is located.[3] After that, in early 1992, the company consolidated and expanded its operations into laboratory space at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Incubator Annex in Watervliet N.Y. By 1997, the company occupied laboratory space in the C-wing of the SUNY Albany East Campus, which was formerly the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute.[4] In 1999, through the purchase of Enzymed Inc. (Iowa City, IA), the company added biocatalysis capabilities[5] before, AMRI acquired American Advanced Organics, Inc. of Syracuse N.Y. in 2000.[6] In 2001, the company added natural product isolation and identification technology through the acquisition of New Chemical Entities of Bothell, WA.[7] In early 2001, AMRI began leasing space in 30 Corporate Circle, which was fitted out as discovery chemistry laboratory space. The company then purchased two buildings at 24 and 26 Corporate Circle. The original building at 26 was demolished. Construction on a new 26 Corporate Circle building began in November 2002 and AMRI’s new Corporate Headquarters was opened in April 2004.[8]
AMRI went on to establish offshore subsidiaries, which included the Albany Molecular Research Singapore Research Centre, Pte. Ltd., located in Singapore, and the Albany Molecular Research Hyderabad Research Centre, Pvt. Ltd., located in India (both in 2005).[9] AMRI acquired the Budapest operations of ComGenex in March 2006.[10] In May 2007, the company officially changed its name to AMRI and introduced a new company logo.[11] AMRI acquired a number of API and chemical intermediates manufacturing facilities from Ariane Orgachem in Aurangabad, India in 2008[12] then in 2010 AMRI completed the acquisition of Excelsyn in Holywell, U.K.[13] This facility underwent successful inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) in June 2011, and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January 2012 allowing for the production of registered intermediates and APIs for human use.[14] After this AMRI expanded into the aseptic fill and finish business, acquiring the parenteral dosage form manufacturing business Hyaluron, located in Burlington, Massachusetts (USA).[15] In early 2012, the company ended operations in Budapest, Hungary, moving most of the operations to the new parallel synthesis and purification laboratories Hyderabad facility.[16] In November 2012, AMRI announced that it would close the Bothell, Washington, site and would transition the sites biology capabilities to Singapore.[17] In December 2012, New York State announced plans to invest $50 million in biomedical research equipment and facilities and secured an agreement with AMRI to locate a new drug discovery R&D facility at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.[18][18] In December 2012, AMRI Rensselaer was awarded a $200,000 Empire State Development Corporation grant for the expansion of the diagnostic imaging agent project.[19]
AMRI completed an initial public offering in February 1999, raising $56.3 million and listing as AMRI on the Nasdaq.[20] The company also completed a secondary public offering in October 2000, generating further net proceeds of $119.5 million.[21] AMRI’s Allegra patent applications, from 1995, and the resulting patents were licensed to what is now Sanofi-Aventis. The company continues to receive royalties on the sale of Allegra and Telfast products globally.[22]
In June 2014, AMRI acquired OsoBio Pharmaceuticals, a contract manufacturer specializing in aseptic filling, for $110 million.[23]
In February 2015, AMRI acquired SSCI based in West Lafayette, Indiana. SSCI was founded in 1991, providing comprehensive cGMP solid state chemistry research and analytical services to the pharmaceutical industry. Servicing more than 250 customers a year, SSCI has an industry-leading reputation for solving difficult drug substance and formulated drug product challenges.[24][25]
In July 2015, the company acquired Gadea Pharmaceutical group for $174 million.[26]
In June 2017 management of AMRI and two private equity firms, The Carlyle Group and GTCR, agreed to sell AMRI to the firms for $21.75 per share, around $1.5 billion, taking the company private. AMRI was weighed down with debt from recent acquisitions and was struggling to make a profit; the arrangement awaited approval of shareholders and regulators.[27] This agreement was part of a burst of M&A activity in the CRO industry, with Lonza Group acquiring Capsugel for around $5.5 billion and Thermo Fisher Scientific buying Patheon for $7.2 billion.[27]
Scientific collaborations[edit]
In July 1997, AMRI received a $100,000 grant from the National Cancer Institute to “design and synthesize compounds that inhibit a class of enzymes responsible for regulation of the cell cycle”.[28] AMRI then extended a deal in 2001 with Pfizer for three additional years to “provide chemistry, research, development and analytical services”.[29] AMRI entered into a 3-year deal with Merck and Co. to “perform medicinal chemistry research and help design and synthesize compounds” in June 2002[8] before, in May 2004, AMRI was awarded a three-year contract to manufacture potential treatments for substance abuse by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.[30] In April 2007, AMRI took a lead role in a three-year, multidisciplinary research program, the CancerGrid Project, funded by the European Commission.[31] and went on to receive a multi-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract Award for the “development of pre-clinical drug candidates to treat diseases of the nervous system” in August 2011.[32]
In October 2012, AMRI announced a five-year extension of an API supply agreement with Shire for an undisclosed product.[33] In December 2012, AMRI announced a multi-year extension of a commercial supply relationship with GE Healthcare to provide Aminobisamide (ABA), a key intermediate used in several diagnostic imaging agents.[34]
Awards and Nominations[edit]

October 2002, AMRI ranked No. 317 on the Deloitte and Touche list of fast growing technology companies in North America.
In August 2003, AMRI named No. 75 on Forbes’ list of fastest growing companies.
AMRI CEO, Tom D’Ambra, was named as a national finalist for the 2003 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Life Sciences category.[35]

Company history and acquisitions[edit]
Inaugurated in 1991 as Albany Molecular Research, Inc., AMRI was founded by Thomas E. D’Ambra, Ph.D. and Chester Opalka. Dr. D’Ambra continues to serve as chairman, president and CEO. As AMRI, the company has been a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ since 1999.[2] AMRI commenced operations with custom synthesis services in laboratory space provided by Siena College. Following this, the company expanded into laboratory space at the Wright Malta Corporation, which was located on the site where Global Foundries new computer chip fabrication plant is located.[3] After that, in early 1992, the company consolidated and expanded its operations into laboratory space at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Incubator Annex in Watervliet N.Y. By 1997, the company occupied laboratory space in the C-wing of the SUNY Albany East Campus, which was formerly the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute.[4] In 1999, through the purchase of Enzymed Inc. (Iowa City, IA), the company added biocatalysis capabilities[5] before, AMRI acquired American Advanced Organics, Inc. of Syracuse N.Y. in 2000.[6] In 2001, the company added natural product isolation and identification technology through the acquisition of New Chemical Entities of Bothell, WA.[7] In early 2001, AMRI began leasing space in 30 Corporate Circle, which was fitted out as discovery chemistry laboratory space. The company then purchased two buildings at 24 and 26 Corporate Circle. The original building at 26 was demolished. Construction on a new 26 Corporate Circle building began in November 2002 and AMRI’s new Corporate Headquarters was opened in April 2004.[8]
AMRI went on to establish offshore subsidiaries, which included the Albany Molecular Research Singapore Research Centre, Pte. Ltd., located in Singapore, and the Albany Molecular Research Hyderabad Research Centre, Pvt. Ltd., located in India (both in 2005).[9] AMRI acquired the Budapest operations of ComGenex in March 2006.[10] In May 2007, the company officially changed its name to AMRI and introduced a new company logo.[11] AMRI acquired a number of API and chemical intermediates manufacturing facilities from Ariane Orgachem in Aurangabad, India in 2008[12] then in 2010 AMRI completed the acquisition of Excelsyn in Holywell, U.K.[13] This facility underwent successful inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) in June 2011, and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January 2012 allowing for the production of registered intermediates and APIs for human use.[14] After this AMRI expanded into the aseptic fill and finish business, acquiring the parenteral dosage form manufacturing business Hyaluron, located in Burlington, Massachusetts (USA).[15] In early 2012, the company ended operations in Budapest, Hungary, moving most of the operations to the new parallel synthesis and purification laboratories Hyderabad facility.[16] In November 2012, AMRI announced that it would close the Bothell, Washington, site and would transition the sites biology capabilities to Singapore.[17] In December 2012, New York State announced plans to invest $50 million in biomedical research equipment and facilities and secured an agreement with AMRI to locate a new drug discovery R&D facility at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.[18][18] In December 2012, AMRI Rensselaer was awarded a $200,000 Empire State Development Corporation grant for the expansion of the diagnostic imaging agent project.[19]
AMRI completed an initial public offering in February 1999, raising $56.3 million and listing as AMRI on the Nasdaq.[20] The company also completed a secondary public offering in October 2000, generating further net proceeds of $119.5 million.[21] AMRI’s Allegra patent applications, from 1995, and the resulting patents were licensed to what is now Sanofi-Aventis. The company continues to receive royalties on the sale of Allegra and Telfast products globally.[22]
In June 2014, AMRI acquired OsoBio Pharmaceuticals, a contract manufacturer specializing in aseptic filling, for $110 million.[23]
In February 2015, AMRI acquired SSCI based in West Lafayette, Indiana. SSCI was founded in 1991, providing comprehensive cGMP solid state chemistry research and analytical services to the pharmaceutical industry. Servicing more than 250 customers a year, SSCI has an industry-leading reputation for solving difficult drug substance and formulated drug product challenges.[24][25]
In July 2015, the company acquired Gadea Pharmaceutical group for $174 million.[26]
In June 2017 management of AMRI and two private equity firms, The Carlyle Group and GTCR, agreed to sell AMRI to the firms for $21.75 per share, around $1.5 billion, taking the company private. AMRI was weighed down with debt from recent acquisitions and was struggling to make a profit; the arrangement awaited approval of shareholders and regulators.[27] This agreement was part of a burst of M&A activity in the CRO industry, with Lonza Group acquiring Capsugel for around $5.5 billion and Thermo Fisher Scientific buying Patheon for $7.2 billion.[27]
Scientific collaborations[edit]
In July 1997, AMRI received a $100,000 grant from the National Cancer Institute to “design and synthesize compounds that inhibit a class of enzymes responsible for regulation of the cell cycle”.[28] AMRI then extended a deal in 2001 with Pfizer for three additional years to “provide chemistry, research, development and analytical services”.[29] AMRI entered into a 3-year deal with Merck and Co. to “perform medicinal chemistry research and help design and synthesize compounds” in June 2002[8] before, in May 2004, AMRI was awarded a three-year contract to manufacture potential treatments for substance abuse by the National Institute of Drug Abuse.[30] In April 2007, AMRI took a lead role in a three-year, multidisciplinary research program, the CancerGrid Project, funded by the European Commission.[31] and went on to receive a multi-year National Institutes of Health (NIH) contract Award for the “development of pre-clinical drug candidates to treat diseases of the nervous system” in August 2011.[32]
In October 2012, AMRI announced a five-year extension of an API supply agreement with Shire for an undisclosed product.[33] In December 2012, AMRI announced a multi-year extension of a commercial supply relationship with GE Healthcare to provide Aminobisamide (ABA), a key intermediate used in several diagnostic imaging agents.[34]
Awards and Nominations[edit]

October 2002, AMRI ranked No. 317 on the Deloitte and Touche list of fast growing technology companies in North America.
In August 2003, AMRI named No. 75 on Forbes’ list of fastest growing companies.
AMRI CEO, Tom D’Ambra, was named as a national finalist for the 2003 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in the Life Sciences category.[35]
In May 2007, AMRI received the Excellence in Business Award at the New York State Investors Conference.[36]
Dr. D’Ambra was inducted into the Tech Valley Business Hall of Fame in May 2008.[36]
In August 2010, AMRI received the Pfizer Route Design Innovation Award.[37]
On March 16, 2011 AMRI’s Singapore Research Centre was named the inaugural winner of the BioSpectrum-BioSingapore Special Award 2011 in honor of its “contributions to the creation of employment opportunities in the life sciences segment in Singapore.”

Company history and acquisitions[edit]
Inaugurated in 1991 as Albany Molecular Research, Inc., AMRI was founded by Thomas E. D’Ambra, Ph.D. and Chester Opalka. Dr. D’Ambra continues to serve as chairman, president and CEO. As AMRI, the company has been a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ since 1999.[2] AMRI commenced operations with custom synthesis services in laboratory space provided by Siena College. Following this, the company expanded into laboratory space at the Wright Malta Corporation, which was located on the site where Global Foundries new computer chip fabrication plant is located.[3] After that, in early 1992, the company consolidated and expanded its operations into laboratory space at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Incubator Annex in Watervliet N.Y. By 1997, the company occupied laboratory space in the C-wing of the SUNY Albany East Campus, which was formerly the Sterling Winthrop Research Institute.[4] In 1999, through the purchase of Enzymed Inc. (Iowa City, IA), the company added biocatalysis capabilities[5] before, AMRI acquired American Advanced Organics, Inc. of Syracuse N.Y. in 2000.[6] In 2001, the company added natural product isolation and identification technology through the acquisition of New Chemical Entities of Bothell, WA.[7] In early 2001, AMRI began leasing space in 30 Corporate Circle, which was fitted out as discovery chemistry laboratory space. The company then purchased two buildings at 24 and 26 Corporate Circle. The original building at 26 was demolished. Construction on a new 26 Corporate Circle building began in November 2002 and AMRI’s new Corporate Headquarters was opened in April 2004.[8]
AMRI went on to establish offshore subsidiaries, which included the Albany Molecular Research Singapore Research Centre, Pte. Ltd., located in Singapore, and the Albany Molecular Research Hyderabad Research Centre, Pvt. Ltd., located in India (both in 2005).[9] AMRI acquired the Budapest operations of ComGenex in March 2006.[10] In May 2007, the company officially changed its name to AMRI and introduced a new company logo.[11] AMRI acquired a number of API and chemical intermediates manufacturing facilities from Ariane Orgachem in Aurangabad, India in 2008[12] then in 2010 AMRI completed the acquisition of Excelsyn in Holywell, U.K.[13] This facility underwent successful inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) in June 2011, and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in January 2012 allowing for the production of registered intermediates and APIs for human use.[14] After this AMRI expanded into the aseptic fill and finish business, acquiring the parenteral dosage form manufacturing business Hyaluron, located in Burlington, Massachusetts (USA).[15] In early 2012, the company ended operations in Budapest, Hungary, moving most of the operations to the new parallel synthesis and purification laboratories Hyderabad facility.[16] In November 2012, AMRI announced that it would close the Bothell, Washington, site and would transition the sites biology capabilities to Singapore.[17] In December 2012, New York State announced plans to invest $50 million in biomedical research equipment and facilities and secured an agreement with AMRI to locate a new drug discovery R&D facility at the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus.[18][18] In December 2012, AMRI Rensselaer was awarded a $200,000 Empire State Development Corporation grant for the expansion of the diagnostic imaging agent project.[19]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
