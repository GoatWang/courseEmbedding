             - 
            
               JUST REDUCED! Don't wait, it won't last long. This property has 6.76 beautiful acres with a large spring fed fishing pond. 2 Buildings, one is a 32x80 DW Mobile Home with 5 bedrooms plus office & 3 full baths in excellent condition. The other building was a 200'concrete block small hotel with 11 rooms and 3 baths. There is 615' of road frontage on US HWY 1, 2 wells, 2 separate electric boxes, & 2 septic systems. Would be great for a private residence, small farm and the concrete bldg could be a barn or horse stalls. Would also make a nice Veterinary hospital or dog kennels.

About UsHome  About Us




We’ve taken over 40 years combined green industry experience and rolled it up into one idea that saves consumers time, hassle and money on their landscape hard goods.
2016 was our first year in business and we intend to change your perceptions of mulch delivery and landscape yards. We strive to offer you a quality product, delivered where you want it, without the hassle of trying to figure out how you are going to get it home.
We have one price, delivered to your door and paid for online or COD to our friendly and courteous delivery driver. Try the local garden centers and landscape yards and see their pricing. It looks easy until you have to add a delivery charge and even translate their complicated delivery zones and matrixes. The big box stores? We are much better quality and better priced…and you don’t have to load it yourself.  Bottom line, if you are within 10 miles of our Souderton yard we will deliver any of our many products to you for one price! We do require a 3 yard minimum delivery but ask your neighbors to share a yard or two and enjoy the savings. Don’t ruin your pickup truck or line the minivan floor with plastic. Just have us deliver to your door.
In the future, we plan to add services that will help you with your DIY backyard projects or maybe have us take a few items off the honey-do list. But first, we will continue to develop and improve our mulch delivery business over the next year or so, so you keep coming back. Then we will start to add services that benefit our existing customers, make their lives easier and their homes and landscapes beautiful.
We hope you love our service and prices. We look forward to servicing you in 2017!
Pick. Pay. Deliver. Done.
