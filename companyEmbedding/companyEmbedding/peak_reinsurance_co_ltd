Peak Re appoints Head of Underwriting and Head of Analytics


23/02/2016



Peak Reinsurance Company Ltd (“Peak Re”), the Hong Kong-based global reinsurer, is pleased to announce the appointments of Mr. Lawrence Cheng as Head of Underwriting, responsible for the company’s Property & Casualty product underwriting function and Mr. Iain Reynolds as Head of Analytics with immediate effect.
Mr. Cheng previously served as Head of Analytics at Peak Re. He has extensive experience in the reinsurance industry with both broking and reinsurance companies.
Mr. Reynolds joins Peak Re from Guy Carpenter where he served as Head of Catastrophe Modelling for South East Asia, Korea and India. Prior to that, he was the Head of Catastrophe Modelling for Global and Retro Clients in the German speaking region at Guy Carpenter Munich.
Commenting on the appointments, Franz Josef Hahn, Chief Executive Officer of Peak Re, said: “Lawrence has been part of the Peak Re team since the beginning and has played an important role in laying the foundation of our analytics structure. He has also gained extensive exposure on the underwriting side, benefitting from our unique underwriting model which brings together expertise in market underwriting, product underwriting and analytics in a triangular risk evaluation process. With his solid understanding of our underwriting and risk management principles, I am confident that he will succeed in leading our product underwriting function.”
“Iain is a very experienced CAT modeller with comprehensive experience and track record in designing appropriate risk assessment tools, as well as offering appropriate and effective solutions for both regional and global clients. Peak Re is always committed to investing in knowledge and technology to offer the best service to our clients.  Our analytics function is now one of the best in the region, and with Iain on board, I look forward to his success in further strengthening our analytics, research and risk assessment capabilities. ”
    
Lawrence Cheng, Head of Underwriting                    Iain Reynolds, Head of Analytics

Labuan is the the federal territory of Malaysia. It is made up of Labuan Island and six smaller islands.
Franz-Josef Hahn, chief executive officer of Peak Re, said Malaysia plays an important role in Peak Re’s business strategy.
