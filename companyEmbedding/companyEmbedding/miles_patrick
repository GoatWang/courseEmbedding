Card Message
The story of St. Patricks Day begins in Ireland On hillsides with the green, green grass Beneath the Irish sun. St. Patty put this grass of green in baskets he did weave, and filled them up with chocolate eggs For children to receive. uhm, actually, I think youve got it wrong, therelisten to thisahem. St. Pattys Day commemorates a date from long ago: The Pilgrims and the natives dined, on food that they did grow, along with fish and turkeys too, they ate their peas and corn, They later added football, and a holiday was born. NO...no...no ya eejit! Thats not it St. Padddys day is when the kids go around with their scary masks and Achhh! You doont have the sense you were born with, Lad, its when Santa comes down the chimn That shows what you know... Make no mistake about it Im wishing you a Happy St. Patricks Day! and then if the turkey sees his shadow... For some No Blarney Facts About St. Patricks Day, click any of the Shamrocks! sharmrock #1 St. Patricks Day is the annual feast of St. Patrick (circa AD 385-461), a patron saint of Ireland. According to legend, St. Patrick used the green three-leaf clover (the shamrock) to explain the holy trinity to the Christians of Ireland. This is how the wearing of the green became a tradition. sharmrock #2 Although an Irish holiday, the largest St. Patricks Day parade in the world is in New York City, where 150,000 marchers participate. sharmrock #3 The Chicago River is dyed green each year for St. Patricks Day. sharmrock #4 In Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and the US, St. Patricks Day is not an official holiday, but is widely celebrated.

Card Message
Look up to the sky -- The clouds keep changing. Look down at your feet -- The road is rearranging. The world keeps you guessing. Its pace is unforgiving. But what never changes is knowing The Irish way of living. Be free and be strong, Live well and live long. There's a love that keeps on giving -- That's the Irish way of living. The sun, it may be setting, The sea may stir the sky, The good Lord we are betting Truly knows the reason why. The world never rests. There's more taking than there's giving. But when all seems lost, remember There's the Irish way of living. Be good and be true. Be love and be you. Be kind and be forgiving That's the Irish way of living.

March seventeenth is what we call St. Patricks Day Shoemaking leprechauns hoard all their gold away Clovers with four leafs can make a Good Luck bouquet As we sing out the St. Patricks Chin Song. When Irish chins sing, its a song you can dance to, lad Whisky and lager can cheer you up if youre sad Pipes may be calling, but Murphys heads feeling bad Corned beef and cabbage is coming on strong. Red-headed lasses will ask you so freely, Is that your shillelagh or you glad to see me? A rainbow and pot of gold wait round the bend And if youre not Irish, well, you can pretend.	Pubs barely open but Flanagans bleary-eyed Shamrocks and Blarney Stones got Kelly teary-eyed Father OMalleys on his second beer and rye As we sing loud the St. Patricks Chin Song. O lets lift a glass up to Cork and Kilkenny Wed name all the counties, but there are too many Our Irish Pride comes out of each nook and cranny When we sing out the St. Patricks Chin Song. Red-headed lasses will ask you so freely, Is that your shillelagh or you glad to see me? A rainbow and pot of gold wait round the bend If you like this stanza, well sing it again. Red-headed lasses will ask you so freely, Is that your shillelagh or you glad to see me? A rainbow and pot of gold wait round the bend And St. Patricks Day Chin Song has come to an end!

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
