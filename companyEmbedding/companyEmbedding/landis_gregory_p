Complaint / review / scam reportSegal, Cohen & Landis LLP. & Gregory P. Segal/Does/30Falsely advertised, Misrepresented their capabilities to resolve my FTB an IRS back tax issues and kept $7750 after being terminated
 if (isset($_SESSION['showadr']) == FALSE) {?>





}?>		
		
Complaint / review text:I hired Segal, Cohen & Landis, LLP and was represented by Gregory P. Segal. They were hired to resolve my back FTB and IRS taxes. I paid an upfront fee of $2500 plus $350 a month for over 2 years. My case was literally ripped to shred by this firm and innocent people were hurt.I had to file suit in superior court just to be able to bring this firm in front of an arbitrator, judge or jury. We complained and filed a demand to be heard in arbitration (AAA) per the contract I signed. This law firm failed to honor the arbitration clause in the agreement. Therefore, my case could not be heard on what they did wrong with our case.My case consists of many wrong doing by this firm and their are too many to list. Please visit the Sacramento Superior Court website to review the case filed against this firm. Type in Segal, Cohen & Landis LLP. To retrieve the case number and PLEASE READ THE COMPLAINT.This firm is taking advantage of innocent people who find themselves in a situation of having back taxes. They prey on these consumers knowing you do not have the means or the resources to fight back when they leave you stuck with the same problem you came to them about.in my case they made everything worse.You are stronger than you think. Some of us don't have the financial means to fight so you have to do it yourself. But you still have a voice. Please beware of this firm.
