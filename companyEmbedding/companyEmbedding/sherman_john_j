Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1913 edition. Volume: no.36 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Washington, D.C. : U.S. Dept. of Agriculture 42 pages Volume: no.36.  Bookseller Inventory # 453615063

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: New York : American Book Company 156 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 457766577

About C. Sherman Johnson Company  
1


C. Sherman Johnson Company Incorporated was founded in 1958 by Curtiss S. Johnson Jr (1925 - 2005). Mr. Johnson's love of sailing inspired him to design and manufacture stainless steel turnbuckles, fittings and marine accessories for the pleasure marine market. Many patents and innovative designs lead Johnson Marine (Trade Name) to become one of the largest OEM supplies of life line hardware in the marine industry. Somewhere in the middle 1980's Johnson Marine started to be contacted by architects looking to design railings in buildings using stainless steel aircraft cable with the cable as infill for the railings. At the time this new "cable railing" was thought to be a "fluke" or an anomaly that was a niche design fad. Little did anyone know it was not.After many calls for cable railings, the light bulb went on and a new division was formed called Johnson Architectural Hardware to design, market and manufacture specific architectural hardware for cable and wire railings. The new division took off and Johnson cable rails can be found in private homes, commercial, municipal, educational, medical and sports arenas. Stainless steel cable does not block your view and adds a custom look to deck railings, stair railings and railings in general. Approximately two-thirds of C. Sherman Johnson Company's business is non marine primarily in the architectural field.Johnson offers cable and wire fittings in 1/16" to 3/8" sizes in type 316 stainless steel for machine swage, Hand Crimp, mechanical termination and splice termination. In the latest Johnson Architectural catalog you can find cable railing hardware and Terminal Tuner, Classic, Decko, Smooth Line, Terminator and Threaded Terminal Turnbuckles to accent the look of any infill cable system. In the latest Johnson Marine catalog you will find life line turnbuckles, pelican hooks, gate eyes and Splice Line fittings. Standing rigging turnbuckles are offered in open, tubular and slotted configuration. Dinghy and one design turnbuckles are not forgotten with quick release levers, calibrated stay and shroud adjusters, Handy Lock Turnbuckles, split back stay cars and toggle jaws. Johnson offers a full line of cotter pins, clevis pins, rigging pins, ring pins, quick release pins, lock rings and lock nuts.You will find what you need to cable rail your next project or rig your sailboat at C. Sherman Johnson Company and it's made in the USA.
