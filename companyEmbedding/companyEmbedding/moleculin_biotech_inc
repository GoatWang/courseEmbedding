About Us
About Childhood Leukemia
About CTCL




Moleculin Biotech, Inc. is preclinical and clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of game-changing anti-cancer drug candidates, many of which are based on discoveries made at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the world’s largest cancer research facility headquartered within the world’s largest medical center. Each of our projects represents a breakthrough discovery and a highly disruptive technology.
Our lead product candidate is Annamycin, a Phase II clinical stage anthracycline for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, more commonly referred to as AML.
Unlike current therapies that risk cardiotoxicity and can have their effectiveness limited due to multidrug resistance, Annamycin appears capable of avoiding both of these problems and has already demonstrated the ability to save lives in clinic.  We are now preparing to seek accelerated approval for this game-changing drug.
We also have two active pre-clinical small molecule portfolios, one of which is focused on the modulation of hard-to-target cell signaling mechanisms and appears capable stimulating the patient’s natural immune system while also attacking tumors directly.  The other portfolio targets the metabolism of tumors and exploits a unique approach for crossing the blood brain barrier for the treatment of glioblastoma and other central nervous system malignancies.
  

PROBLEM: Cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance severely limit pediatric oncologists’ ability to effectively treat children suffering from acute leukemia.
SOLUTION: We believe Annamycin’s ability to avoid both cardiotoxicity and multidrug resistance has the potential to eliminate this critical problem.

One of the most exciting scientific discoveries here at Moleculin, which we believe will have a profound impact on the treatment of children suffering from Acute Leukemia, is our lead drug Annamycin’s ability to be non-cardiotoxic.
We believe that this characteristic alone has the ability to change the way pediatric oncologists’ treat children suffering from acute leukemia for the foreseeable future.
Cardiotoxicity can be a killer, causing severe, permanent and sometimes fatal damage to the heart of both adults and children and cardiotoxicity is highly present in the currently approved drugs used to treat all acute leukemia patients. The drugs that are used to treat acute leukemia patients are called “anthracyclines.”
Oncologists (and especially pediatric oncologists) are limited in how they can treat their patients, due to the harmful effects of cardiotoxicity.

Here are some quotes from other publications:
“The effectiveness of anthracyclines and related compounds (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin, and the anthraquinone mitoxantrone) is hindered by their cardiotoxicity.” – Cardiotoxicity of anthracycline-like chemotherapy agents
“Anthracyclines remain an important class of drugs in the treatment of cancer, but also remains a problematic chemotherapeutic agent given their cardiotoxic effects.” – Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity: Prevalence, Pathogenesis and Treatment
To better understand how cardiotoxicity impacts children suffering from acute leukemia, consider that acute leukemia is the most common form of cancer in children, comprising approximately 30 percent of all childhood malignancies. Of the acute leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs more commonly than acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however the treatment of both typically involves the same induction therapy (the preparation for a bone marrow transplant) used in adults to reduce the presence of leukemic cells in the patient’s bone marrow and bloodstream in preparation for a curative bone marrow transplant.
Most unfortunately for children, however, the standard drug used in such induction therapies is significantly cardiotoxic.
This often means that even though the chances are often good that current treatments can cure a child’s leukemia, it is very likely that the child’s lifespan will be shortened and their quality of life diminished as a result of permanent heart damage caused by current therapies.
This is why we believe Annamycin’s lack of cardiotoxicity has the ability to change the way children are treated for the foreseeable future.
Annamycin has been shown to be non-cardiotoxic in animal models, when compared with one of the leading anthracyclines (doxorubicin).
To make matters worse, the leading induction therapy drugs lose efficacy due to something called “multidrug resistance” requiring more and more drug to try and prepare patients for a successful bone marrow transplant, but because of the harmful effects of cardiotoxicity, patients simply cannot tolerate an increase in dosage.  At the same time that Annamycin avoids cardiotoxicity, it also avoids multidrug resistance, and as a result, Annamycin has demonstrated in early clinical trials the ability to deliver efficacy in patients who have failed repeated attempts with the existing induction therapy drugs.
Oncologists, and especially Pediatric Oncologists, have been clear that there is a tremendous unmet need here and we believe Annamycin has the potential to fill that need and change forever how children with leukemia are treated.  The severity of this unmet need may allow us to position Annamycin for accelerated approval under FDA guidelines and we will be working hard this year to secure an accelerated approval pathway. We look forward to moving quickly to translate this important breakthrough into new hope for those children who have run out of options.
Here are some interesting articles on the effects of cardiotoxicity:
Risk of heart damage follows some childhood cancer survivors
Woman battling breast cancer diagnosed with heart failure
  

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, is a rare cancer that occurs when T-cells in the skin grow uncontrollably. It is estimated that about 16,000 to 20,000 people in the U.S. have CTCL with a higher incidence in men between the ages of 50 and 60 years old.
CTCL is often mistaken for eczema, psoriasis or contact dermatitis, since it initially presents as patches or plaques. Over time, the patient may develop tumors or generalized erythroderma (abnormal redness of the skin over widespread areas of the body).
The disease is categorized as Stages I-IV, each of which represents an increased risk for metastasis, or the spread of cancer to distant parts of the body. About three-quarters of the patient population fall into Stages IA, IB and IIA, the lower risk group. Once the disease becomes systemic, however, the prognosis—or outlook—is significantly worse. Beginning with Stage IIB, CTCL is considered progressive (or advanced) and median survival drops to 4 years.








 
 
 


“I have been in drug development for close to 35 years and led the development of carboplatin and cisplatin, which have been blockbuster drugs for years. In all my experience, Annamycin is one of the best drug development opportunities I’ve seen.”

Cardiotoxicity
 








A key advantage of our lead drug, Annamycin, is it’s lack of cardiotoxicity.  To understand just how important this, we need to focus on the critical role cardiotoxicity plays when treating cancer patients, especially children.
The term cardiotoxic refers to drugs that can cause severe, permanent and sometimes fatal damage to the heart.
Cardiotoxicity is a major concern for clinicians as they administer chemotherapy to their patients. The effects of cardiotoxicity are not always immediate. They can show up 5, 10 or 15 years later and the patient can possibly die from heart failure caused by the chemotherapy that was intended to save their life.
When treating a child with a chemotherapy regimen, cardiotoxicity plays an extremely important role as the clinician has to limit dosing due to the potential for heart failure. This can be very restrictive in cases where the cancer is aggressive and the need for higher dosing is required, yet the risk of severe cardiotoxicity is great enough that dosing must be limited.
Even after a successful treatment, it is suggested that childhood cancer survivors should visit their doctor yearly for follow-up care because heart conditions may not cause symptoms early on.
This is why we believe our lead drug Annamycin is extremely disruptive with its ability to be non-cardiotoxic. Annamycin was designed to avoid the cardiotoxicity that is common with currently approved therapies, and it has been shown to be non-cardiotoxic in animal studies.
We believe this unique characteristic alone increases the chances that we would receive an accelerated approval pathway for the treatment of acute leukemia here in the US, and in Europe.
For clinicians globally, having the ability to treat acute leukemia patients with a drug that is non-cardiotoxic would be a game-changer in the industry.

Multidrug Resistance

Multidrug Resistance
 








Multidrug Resistance (MDR) refers to mechanisms by which many cancers develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs and is a major factor in the failure of many forms of chemotherapy. It affects patients with a variety of blood cancers and solid tumors, including breast, ovarian, lung, and lower gastrointestinal tract cancers. Tumors usually consist of mixed populations of malignant cells, some of which are drug-sensitive while others are drug-resistant. Chemotherapy kills drug-sensitive cells, but leaves behind a higher proportion of drug-resistant cells. As the tumor begins to grow again, chemotherapy may fail because the remaining tumor cells are now able to recognize the chemotherapy and reject it at the cellular level, thus rendering it resistant to the therapy.

This resistance to therapy is often the result of molecular “pumps” in tumor-cell membranes that actively expel chemotherapy drugs from the interior. This allows tumor cells to avoid the intended toxic effects of the drug.
As MDR begins to counteract chemotherapy drugs, it can require higher and higher doses to kill tumor cells, yet the unwanted side effects of the drugs, like cardiotoxicity, ultimately prevent such increases in dosing.
Two kinds of pumps commonly responsible for multidrug resistance in cancer are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the so-called multidrug resistance–associated protein (MRP). Because of their role in MDR, they have been the targets of several anticancer efforts.  Unfortunately, efforts to block the activity of these pumps have resulted in serious side effects because they also play an important role in normal cell function.
Our most advanced therapy, Annamycin, represents a much-needed breakthrough in the battle against multidrug resistance.  Its unique design prevents it from being recognized by MDR pumps, allowing Annamycin to avoid the multidrug resistance mechanisms that often defeat current therapies.

About AML
 








Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and the acute forms of leukemia can manifest quickly and leave patients with limited treatment options. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. It occurs when a clone of leukemic progenitor white blood cells proliferates in the bone marrow suppressing the production of normal blood cells. The therapy of combining 2 chemotherapeutic drugs which always includes an anthracycline in inducing a CR or complete response has not improved since it was first used in the 1970’s and we estimate that it has the same cure rate of about 20% as then.
Currently, the only viable option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant, which is successful in a significant number of patients. However, in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, the patient’s leukemia cells must be decreased to a sufficiently low level. Unfortunately, the current clinically approved anthracyclines are cardiotoxic, which can result in damage to the heart and limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients. Additionally, the tumor cells often present de novo or developed resistance to the first line anthracycline, often through what is called “multidrug resistance” making them capable of purging themselves of the available anthracyclines.
Consequently, there remains no effective therapy for these patients and unfortunately most will succumb quickly to their leukemia. If a patient’s leukemia reappears before they can be prepared for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to have “relapsed”. If a patient fails to achieve a sufficient response from the induction therapy to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, they are considered to be “refractory” (resistant to therapy). Together, this group of AML patients is our primary focus with Annamycin and our intent is to pursue approval for Annamycin as a second-line induction therapy for relapsed and refractory AML patients.
Of the estimated 18,860 U.S. cases of acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed in 2014, an estimated 97% were adult and although exact numbers are not available, we estimate that 70% to 80% (approximately 13,000 to 14,000 patients) were expected to relapse or be resistant to first-line therapy.

About Us
 









Moleculin Biotech, Inc. is preclinical and clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of game-changing anti-cancer drug candidates, many of which are based on discoveries made at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the world’s largest cancer research facility headquartered within the world’s largest medical center. Each of our projects represents a breakthrough discovery and a highly disruptive technology.
Our lead product candidate is Annamycin, a Phase II clinical stage anthracycline for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, more commonly referred to as AML.
Unlike current therapies that risk cardiotoxicity and can have their effectiveness limited due to multidrug resistance, Annamycin appears capable of avoiding both of these problems and has already demonstrated the ability to save lives in clinic.  We are now preparing to seek accelerated approval for this game-changing drug.
We also have two active pre-clinical small molecule portfolios, one of which is focused on the modulation of hard-to-target cell signaling mechanisms and appears capable stimulating the patient’s natural immune system while also attacking tumors directly.  The other portfolio targets the metabolism of tumors and exploits a unique approach for crossing the blood brain barrier for the treatment of glioblastoma and other central nervous system malignancies.

Meet Molekule, the world’s first molecular air purifier.
02
After 20 years of research and development, a groundbreaking approach to clean air has arrived. Molekule breaks down harmful microscopic pollutants like allergens, mold, bacteria, viruses and even airborne chemicals.



























 







Destroys, Doesn’t Collect
Fully eradicates pollutants instead of simply trapping them, so that nothing builds up on the filter.







Any Size
Destroys pollutants regardless how small, incl. those 1000x times smaller than what HEPA can collect







Full Spectrum
Only product that eliminates the full range of indoor pollutants, including VOCs and viruses

I have tried many other "air purifiers" through the years. They are simply not effective. I live in one of the most polluted cities in the nation (Los Angeles), have cats, allergies, and trouble sleeping. Molecule made a HUGE difference in my sleep and my health!! I now wake up well rested and not sniffling and sneezing. It is amazing!! I have NEVER had an air purifier do this before.    Read More

I lived in a permanent state of congestion and hadn't breathed through my nose in over 15 years...Within a week of having Molekule in my bedroom on "full power", 24/7, my nose entirely cleared up. I stopped waking up with watery, bloodshot, puffy eyes. I stopped sneezing. I stoped drooling and snoring in my sleep. I stopped waking up with wheezing panics where my throat had almost entirely closed during the night. At first, my symptom relief was contained only to my bedroom, but within about 3 months, I felt my symptoms lessen even when I LEFT my bedroom...    Read More

My wife and I moved from New York to Florida a few years ago and were instantly plagued by inflamed asthma as well as allergies to all the new pollens and trees...We tried a few other "big name" air purifiers to no avail. Introduce Molekule: Molekule arrived at our home the day we started renovations...To our amazement, in only an hour after work was completed for the day the entire downstairs was habitable again and there was no remnant smell or dust from construction. We were all able to sleep in our bedrooms on the first floor and had the best night of sleep since moving to Florida. Molekule has made such an impact on our lives...    Read More

If only all other aspects of allergies were this glamorous

Reason I bought a Molekule
Allergies
Asthma


Gunky eyes, runny nose, eczema from makeup and moisturizers--it's allergy season in the Bay Area, and there is nothing glamorous about it. Except for the most gorgeous piece of allergy equipment ever. Since adding it to my house, I'm sleeping like a baby. And the air just smells better. (Seriously I move it into other rooms of the house when it doesn't smell as "clean" as my bedroom now.) Aaaaand it just looks great. The design looks like it belongs in AD or Sunset Magazine. I've been recommending it to anyone I've caught sneezing. But really anyone with two eyes and a nose could benefit.

I cannot even write a deserving review for the Molekule. (Molly Cool is the name of my device) Not only do I live in an area heavy of oil refineries, but my wife and oldest daughter are literally bed ridden due to extreme allergies. Since the first week of having the Molekule, neither of them have had a single alllergy crisis. It took just maybe 2 minutes to set up, and looks sleep in any room. As a functional wellness consultant I have recommended this device to everyone I know that can benefit from breathing cleaner air.

Not to mention, it is a beautiful and well crafted piece of "furniture" in my home. I am proud to show it to people! (And I do...even though it lives in my bedroom most of the time. Seriously, I bring it out at parties to show people.) I can't imagine living without it.

It transformed my life

Reason I bought a Molekule
Allergies
Pets
Mold
Air Pollution


I have an extreme case of environmental allergies—to the point that my immune system is "on record" at several major hospitals. I've had allergists in five different countries look at my lab results in disbelief at the depth and breadth of my reactivity, and literally tell me that I was one of the worst cases they'd ever seen. I lived in a permanent state of congestion and hadn't breathed through my nose in over 15 years (that sounds like an impossible exaggerration. It is not. I was that slack-jawed person who wheezed and panted through life at all times). I've had two major under-anesthetic sinus surgeries (septoplasty and turbinoplasty), I've had acupuncture, I've taken an obscene cocktail of powerful drugs and inhalants. None of these approaches had a particular impact on my quality of life, but came with considerable side effects. I finally got to the point where I simply....gave up. It had been simply too many attempts and too much failure. I decided to simply accept that this was going to be something I simply needed to learn to accept. About a year ago, my boss actually bought Molekule for me as a gift because a) they are wonderful and b) he felt sorry for how ill I looked all the time (it's very visible). I had absolutely no faith it would work because NOTHING EVER HAS, but in the interest of being polite I dutifully turned it on at home. Within a week of having Molekule in my bedroom on "full power", 24/7, my nose entirely cleared up. I stopped waking up with watery, bloodshot, puffy eyes. I stopped sneezing. I stoped drooling and snoring in my sleep. I stopped waking up with wheezing panics where my throat had almost entirely closed during the night. At first, my symptom relief was contained only to my bedroom, but within about 3 months, I felt my symptoms lessen even when I LEFT my bedroom. I can't explain why, but perhaps having 8-12 hours a day with my immune system not being constantly assaulted by allergens allowed it to begin to recalibrate and tone down. I still have skin allergies (eczema), but my ear, nose, throat symptoms are 90% resolved. I am calmly breathing through my nose as I type this, and I can tell you that it's an absolute transformation. I will happily purchase a Molekule for every room in my house, and have ordered two more for my office at work. I believe this is a breakthrough innovation for those who suffer deeply from environmental allergies and can wholeheartedly recommend it. I've never endorsed anything that I've purchased in the past and genuinely believed this would fail me. It did not, and I happily recommend it now.

My son suffers from severe allergies. We starting using the device due to his constant battle with symptoms due to his allergies. He would wake up sneezing, congested and runny nose, itchy eyes and coughing. Even with currently undergoing weekly allergy shots, he still experienced multiple symptoms at a high level. Our house does not have curtains, knick knacks, carpet, rugs and his bedding and pillow are all encased. As a parent, I had done everything I could in our household to allergy proof my home. We tried multiple air purifiers that we purchased at retail stores. However, my efforts still did not give my child relief! Our experience with Molekule has been a life changer :) After just a short period of time using the unit I noticed his symptoms decreasing significantly and his quality of sleep improving. My son would wake up and not experience his sneezing attacks immediately. He would also not have to start off his mornings with blowing his nose multiple times. I know this sounds like a minor issue but he would no longer have to carry a box of tissues and trash can around the house with him. Thank you to Dr. Goswami and the staff at Molekule for giving my son allergy relief when it comes to air quality!

Molekule changed our lives for the better!

Reason I bought a Molekule
Allergies
Asthma
Mold
Air Pollution


My wife and I moved from New York to Florida a few years ago and were instantly plagued by inflamed asthma as well as allergies to all the new pollens and trees. To make matters worse, we purchased a 102 year old home surrounded by Oak trees. Every night was interrupted by our allergy and asthma symptoms and with a baby on the way we were nervous how these symptoms may impact the baby. We tried a few other "big name" air purifiers to no avail. Introduce Molekule: Molekule arrived at our home the day we started renovations. The unit is not only sleek and compact, but elegant in design. It would fit anywhere in our home however we chose the bedroom as it's semi-permanent home. It is as simple to use as plugging it in and following the on screen instructions to select room size and configure it to my phone, all which took no more than five minutes. Immediately I could feel the difference! Not only did the air smell clean, but I could taste clean air as it entered my mouth and nose. It was almost as if I could feel the air in the room changing during the initial cleaning stage of the Molekule. As I mentioned, we started renovations on the bottom floor of our house the day the unit arrived and were prepared to sleep upstairs due to the smoke and dust in the air. To our amazement, in only an hour after work was completed for the day the entire downstairs was habitable again and there was no remnant smell or dust from construction. We were all able to sleep in our bedrooms on the first floor and had the best night of sleep since moving to Florida. Molekule has made such an impact on our lives in the short time we have had it. Allergy symptoms are a rare occasion now and we always sleep through the night. I've gone from have congestion daily to rarely having any congestion on nasal symptoms. Where I once had to use a rescue inhaler daily, I now can't remember the last time I picked it up. I wake up every morning refreshed and ready to start my day. I owe this all to Molekule! We now travel with our unit when we stay in hotels or in other people's homes. The silence of the unit makes zero noise impact on our hosts and there is no stigma of "traveling with an air purifier". The beauty of the unit makes it a conversation piece and I can not tell you how many people ask me "How can I get one?". This was by far the best choice we could have made for our health. I've already ordered 3 more units for other areas of the house and for my office.

It's time to come clean about the air you breathe.



Indoor air is 5 times more polluted than outdoor air.



90% percent of your life is spent indoors.


03
The EPA states indoor air is up to 5x more polluted than outdoor air. Pollutants are trapped inside where they concentrate and multiply to harmful levels. Studies have shown that indoor pollution contributes to a wide variety of health issues for everyone, not just asthma and allergy sufferers.

Molekule disassembles and converts pollutants into harmless elements that are meant to be in the air. This is done by creating a catalytic reaction that happens when a nanoparticle-coated filter is activated by light. Pollutants are broken down into their most basic molecular components, making them safe for us to breathe.

THE MOM
Jodie French






"Molekule has significantly reduced my allergy symptoms. I no longer have constant sinus pressure and irritated eyes. But the biggest change was for my son, Peyton, who’s no longer battling congestion and finally getting a good night’s sleep!”







THE DOCTOR
Dr. Stephen Liggett Assoc. VP of USF Health






"As a pulmonologist who also suffers from asthma I was very impressed by the results I experienced after only a few weeks of using the Molekule device. Despite trying different interventions and medications in the past, I was still experiencing many symptoms. But with Molekule, I finally felt less congestion, was not waking up with headaches in the morning, and had no nocturnal awakenings from my asthma. I feel that the technology holds great potential for future patients."







THE ALLERGY & ASTHMA SUFFERER
Sandi Rosalia






“Before using Molekule I was going to the ER and my Allergist/Immunologist on a regular basis. It’s been over a year and I haven’t been back to the ER or to my doctor for my breathing treatments. Your product works and I feel so lucky to be part of the testing process.”

Introducing PECO.
Molekule’s patented technology, Photo Electrochemical Oxidation (PECO), works at the molecular level to eliminate indoor air pollution. Take a deep breath and see what makes Molekule the first of its kind.









Science at the nanoscale.
Developed over two decades by research scientists, PECO is an innovative technology that utilizes free radicals—the same radicals used to kill cancer cells—to oxidize pollutants. By using nanotechnology, PECO is able to destroy pollutants 1000 times smaller than traditional HEPA filters (0.1 nanometers versus 300 nanometers).

The path to pure air.











STEP 4: Pure Air



STEP 3: Nano-Filter



STEP 2: Pre-Filter



STEP 1: Air Intake







The path to pure air.





STEP 1: 360° Air IntakeMolekule takes in the surrounding air from every angle.

1.1









STEP 2: Pre-FilterThe air is circulated through the pre-filter, trapping larger allergens like dust, pollen, and dander.

2.1









STEP 3: Nano-FilterPECO at work. A chemical reaction is created when a nanoparticle-coated filter is activated by light, breaking down harmful pollutants to their most basic molecular components.

3.1









STEP 4: Pure AirMolekule disperses harmless molecules that are meant to be in the air leaving your home pollution-free in minutes.

4.1











Under the microscope.
Unlike HEPA, PECO can eliminate pollutants at a microscopic scale (including VOCs and viruses), making Molekule the only product that eradicates the full spectrum of indoor air pollutants. These claims have been extensively tested by third party laboratories, and in the spirit of scientific transparency, Molekule also publishes all of its performance data.

BEFORE MOLEKULEBlack mold captured on the surface of the Molekule filter before being broken down.









02
DESTRUCTIONBlack mold in the process of being oxidized (broken down).









03
ELIMINATIONBlack mold is completely oxidized and eliminated.















Airborne Chemical (VOCs)destruction
(on 1000 parts per billion)
A
Independent lab results have shown that PECO destroys VOCs quickly and efficiently. VOCs are too small to be captured by even the best-in-class HEPA filter. Carbon filters, while able to capture some chemicals initially, re-emit these same chemicals back into the air.


Bacteriadestruction
(on 9.7 million e. coli bacteria)
B
Bacteria can easily stay alive on traditional HEPA filters. Studies have shown that bacteria can multiply on these filters and get released back into the air. Even if the bacteria dies they can still release endotoxins into the air if not properly eliminated. Molekule breaks down even the smallest bacteria before they have a chance to accumulate.


Molddestruction
(on 3.4 million black mold spores)
C
Mold spreads through the air and finds surfaces to grow on. While HEPA filters can catch mold, they also become perfect places for mold growth. Eventually, this mold gets released back into the air. Because nothing is collected during the Molekule process, mold is quickly and permanently removed from the air.More About Mold


Virusdestruction
(on 3.4 million MS2 viruses)
D
Viruses are so small they can easily escape HEPA filters, but even if they are caught on the filter they can live there for up to 200 days. PECO offers the first effective solution for managing the spread of airborne infectious diseases. In just two minutes, Molekule can eliminate millions of airborne viruses that are brought indoors.


Allergendestruction
(on 1 million allergens)
E
While the pre-filter will catch the larger dust particles in the air, PECO will break down even the smallest allergens, like pollen, dust mites, and dander to provide truly allergen free air.

Allergenelimination rate

Allergens like pollen and dander are larger pollutants making them easier to collect in the pre-filter. If any smaller particles are released, they will promptly be broken down during the PECO process.












Real People. Real Proof.
05
Our beta trial was conducted on 28 participants including asthma and allergy sufferers. After using Molekule, there was no difference in total symptom score between allergy and non-allergy sufferers. Results point to the potential for Molekule to immediately improve allergy sufferers quality of life.

A catalyst for human progress.
“You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”- R. Buckminster Fuller

 




01
“As an asthma sufferer, I know very personally how precious the air we breathe is.”
- Dilip Goswami / CEO



01

Our Story

In 1995, Dr. Yogi Goswami’s notable career in solar energy collided with indoor air quality when his efforts to relieve his son’s debilitating asthma symptoms were met with frustration and disillusion. As he investigated existing solutions, he found the products attempted to solve the problem of poor indoor air quality by filtering the air. However, he concluded that this method was unable to fundamentally solve this problem.
Resolved to help his ailing son, Dr. Goswami turned toward his own expertise and research in solar energy. He started with a fundamental question: could the principles of solar technology be used to clean the air? With a combination of nanotechnology, light and boundless determination, he developed a revolutionary new approach of eliminating indoor air pollution. After two decades of academic research, countless publications, and multiple patents, the technology behind Molekule was born.






Today, Dr. Goswami’s son, Dilip, has taken his father’s research a step further by creating a physical product in the hopes of helping millions of people breathe better and easier. Dilip has enlisted some of the brightest minds in applied science, engineering, and design to bring Molekule to life.






 





02
We are on a mission to eliminate indoor air pollution, in every home, for everyone.
- Dilip Goswami / CEO

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.
