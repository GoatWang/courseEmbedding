DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Mr. Kempins does not like those abstract designs for catwalk models. He
values practical designs that are contemporary and yet rich in heritage. One’s
clothing should be form of self-expression. Kempins not only the company's
founder and designer, he is also the soul of the KBS brand. His energetic
attitude is evident in the unique charm of the KBS brand. The best dressed man wears
clothes to match his own personality and style, rather than just follows what
is in season on the runway. Mr. Kempins is very passionate to create clothes
made from the best natural fabrics with exceptional attention to design
details.

BRAND HISTORY


BRAND CORE VALUE


PRODUCT STYLE POSITION


DESIGN PHILOSOPHY





KEEP BEST STYLE
One day in 1976 in the romantic French region of Provence, a family, already famous for its achievements in fashion design, welcomed the arrival of its newborn successor and named him Kempins. With his unique vision and distinctive personality, it was soon obvious that young Kempins had inherited his family’s instinct and passion for design. As a young man, he developed his own unique aesthetic and design concepts. He dropped out of his professional studies and chose to go alone to see the world. He embarked on his world tour, looking for each new place’s clothing culture. Kempins found that, while the fashion details may vary culture to culture, everyone strives in his own way to keep his best appearance. In his decade of travel, Kempins developed a deep understanding of life and art. In 2006, Kempins returned to Provence with a redefined concept of fashion. Understanding that everyone desires to express his own individual personality, Kempins organized his first fashion show in 2008 and shocked the fashion industry with his "Keep Best Style" concept, which has rapidly gained popularity in the fashion industry.
