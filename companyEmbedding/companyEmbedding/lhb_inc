Our History - LHB



























































Our History


Respect among a diverse group of specialists, an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to create vibrant communities – these values have been at the heart of LHB since it was founded in Duluth, Minnesota in 1966. LHB’s first project led by LHB’s founder, Lauren Larsen, involved the Duluth Arena (now the Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center) and 50 years later we’re still working with that client. The practice of nurturing long-term relationships by listening to client needs and delivering high performance projects stayed with us.
From its inception, LHB has fostered strong partnerships between its different disciplines. This led to the company’s unique balance between engineering and architecture.  Current CEO Bill Bennett stresses our belief that open and candid dialogue between disciplines improves the end product
Although founded as a structural engineering firm, LHB’s internal diversity quickly expanded to include civil, mechanical and electrical engineers, and architects. In addition, the company brought in landscape architects, interior designers, and surveyors. The structure of the company encouraged strong leaders to develop diverse business focuses. Larsen had once noted, “Early on, LHB chose to foster leadership inside the firm and enabled talented individuals to build industry leading services.”
LHB is now a full-service firm that can complete all facets of a project using dedicated, in-house teams drawn from our 260-person staff. The focus on leadership in each of our markets, combined with our multi-disciplinary approach, lets us stay ahead of changing technologies in an increasingly specialized world. Our ability to deeply understand the industries we work with creates a strong loyalty between us and our clients.
“We will continue to be design leaders and, when appropriate, push the envelope on implementing sustainable design and Performance Metrics,” said LHB CEO Bill Bennett. “We took a more pragmatic and less philosophical approach to those areas and will continue to make them more understandable and real to decision-makers. We will continue to look for ways to bring a real world, performance-focused sensibility to other innovations that the future brings.”
