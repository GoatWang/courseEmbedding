In fact I tell people to stay clear of him! In March 2014 I had my tonsils removed. I was told there was a very very slim chance for complications. He told me I could eat anything I wanted and I had no limitations. Well then the bleeding came went to the ER was told normal and sent home. But back in a few days later and had emergency surgery again bc the bleeding was so bad. He nicked an artery the 1st surgery and I had to get 5 stitches on each side 15-AB in Mc Keesport, PA | Jan 04, 2017Dr. Goldberg ruined my husband's life and robbed him of his health. He performed a very dangerous procedure called a turbinate reduction procedure. At the time, we had no idea of the issues that this procedure would cause. We were just told that his nose would bleed and be a bit sore afterwards. Sure enough, it bled ALOT - enough to go through a few boxes of tissues. Then came the serious and life changing side effects, including permanent nerve damage & ENS in my husband's nose. 55Washington, PA | Dec 01, 2016Dr. Goldberg is exceptional!! He is an excellent surgeon and has a wonderful bedside manner!! He operated on my neck twice and my scar is barely visible....I highly recommend him!55-Rich H in Canonsburg, PA | Oct 22, 2016My experiences with Washington ENT all resulted in an excellent care experience. They provided high quality care in a way that felt very personalized.  I could write a lengthy review but I have always be a person who believes actions speak louder than words. Based on my experiences with the doctors I entrusted them to care for my young child, care that included surgery.  The care my family and I   received  was outstanding in every way.55Pittsburgh, PA | Aug 26, 2016Dr Goldberg treats my children as well as my husband and me. He treats us for all ENT issues as well as our allergies. He was highly recommended to us by other doctors and we strongly feel that he is the best. 
Dr. Goldberg is extremely thorough and knowledgable. He takes the time to answer questions and explain the details of treatment. 
His office staff is friendly and accommodating. Calls are always quickly returned. 
I highly recommend Dr Goldberg for all ages.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Goldberg has no media or publications listed.Background Check n/a Malpractice Claims not availableHealthgrades does not collect malpractice information for Pennsylvania.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Goldberg's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Goldberg's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Goldberg is Board Certified in:OtolaryngologyAccrediting Board: American Board of Otolaryngology ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
