      DONOVAN'S REEF Michael "Guns" Donovan (John Wayne)khaki military shirt Item # D0813                                                        SOLD                         This shirt was worn by Michael Guns Donovan played by John Wayne in the 1963 film Donovans Reef, co-starring Lee Marvin, Jack Warden, Cesar Romero and Elizabeth Allen. The Khaki military shirt was custom made by Machin Shirt Makers of Los Angeles, and their label is sewn into the collar along with the initials JW, as well as a red tag with PARA typed in black ink and 10 handwritten on the verso. 
	

Mr. Wayne can be seen wearing this shirt as Guns, most notably when arguing with Boats(Lee Marvin) and Marquis Andre (Cesar Romero) over the upcoming arrival of Amelia Denham (Elizabeth Allen) who doesnt know about fathers other children. At Dr. Denhams home the group concocts a plan to have Guns pretend the children are his. This upsets the eldest daughter Lelani who runs to her room and Guns consoles her. The children then pack up their belongings and leave their home to move in with Guns. The shirt is also seen when Amelia bids farewell to Guns after first refusing to do so. She speaks to him about the prospect of marriage as long as he gives up his saloon business. Guns points to the bar showing that the sign has changed to Gilhooleys Reef and explains it was given to Boats as a wedding present. They agree to marry, just before Guns drags her over to a fountain and spanks her behind. The shirt is also seen in promotion images of an injured Guns and Boats.
	
 Donovans Reef is 1963 American film by Paramount Pictures starring John Wayne and directed by John Ford. This was the last time that John Wayne and John Ford worked together on a project. The shirt is in good screen worn condition and is accompanied by a letter of authenticity.
