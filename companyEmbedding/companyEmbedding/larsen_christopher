            IMHO, this book is written WAY above a level intended for children. It is extremely grammar focused and memorization (chant) intensive without much application. Page 1 shows you how to conjugate the verb "to love" (amare). Chapter 3 (page 17) introduces 5 different cases for nouns--really?!--nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative. Children are expected to chant 10 endings for each noun (5 cases for singular and 5 for plural)Ã¢â¬âwithout explanations of the cases and when they are used.


I studied German for 2 years, so I'm familiar with declensions, but I'd never heard of the ablative case before this book. I also studied Italian for 2 years and am familiar with changing adjective endings to agree with the noun and not using pronouns in the nominative, but I find it frustrating to teach Latin to my 2 daughters (ages 12 and 8) using this textbook series.


The first 5 vocabulary nouns introduced on page 1 are water, story, gate, forest, and earth. The vocabulary words in Chapter 2 are road (way), ditch, table, goal (turning point), page, dinner, fatherland, breeze, queen, and island. I don't foresee my girls wanting to say "fatherland" or "ditch" in a conversation anytime soon.


I've previewed through Chapter 12, and I haven't figured out how to say, "I'm hungry" or "I'm tired" or "mother" and "father". Yet, between Chapters 3 and 11, the vocabulary words include maidservant, female servant, male servant, female slave, male slave, female master, male master, and public square. This words would be helpful if I were translating a document perhaps.


I wish the books were written to teach the grammar in "bite-sized chunks" and provide vocabulary that is more applicable to children.

            I tried this program with my 10-year-old daughter and she completed roughly 1/3 of the lessons. Having no experience with Latin myself, I found the DVD to be helpful. However, my daughter lacked interest and enthusiasm. The program involves a lot of workbook pages and vocabulary memorization. It takes weeks before the information comes together in a meaningful way. Other reviewers seemed to like it for a group, and perhaps that would create more opportunity for interaction. Using it with one student, I found it to be rather dull and monotonous. I can appreciate the potential benefits of learning Latin; however, this program was not a great fit for us.

            We have only done the first lesson, but I can tell you my son loves the Latin For Children program. It is fun but thorough, and seems well thought-out.

            We belong to an all age coop and our 8th grade son has joined the younger kids with this latin currriculum. Everyday he speaks to me new words that he has learned... I am thrilled with this book!

 NEW 2017 REVISED EDITION!Designed, revised, and continually sharpened since 2001, the award-winning Latin for Children curriculum continues to be a strong, inviting, and creative program designed to introduce students as young as fourth graders to Latin. It incorporates elements that will engage students of every learning style. When used as a whole, this series trains students in grammar, vocabulary, and English derivatives in a lively, interactive way that is perfectly suited to students in the grammar stage. The Latin for Children series is taught directly to the child and is a perfect choice for teachers and parents, including those who will be learning along with their students.The text comes with a plethora of mnemonic aids (songs, chants) that enable students to learn vocabulary (over 240 of the most frequently occurring words) and grammar with ease and delight.What s in the New Revised Edition?Latin for Children Primer A, now printed in full color, has been enhanced with beautiful illustrations as well as images and paintings of ancient Roman culture. An adventure story, Along the Appian Way, has also been added. Students will follow Marcus and Julia as they look for dropped coins or maybe even greater treasures until an accidental run-in with an official messenger brings them more adventure than they bargained for! The chapter-by-chapter Latin grammar sequence remains the same as previous versions. The new teaching video, now in high-definition, is available in streaming or DVD format. Students will love studying Latin even more as they use this newly revised and improved edition.Educators will find all curricula by Classical Academic Press to be created with four important attributes. Each product is classical, creative, relevant, and easy to use. As our company name implies, you will find that we publish classical books and media, seeking to acquaint students with the best that has been thought and said.  We also design and present our products with creativity and zest, from beautiful illustrations to engaging storytelling, ensuring that the classical subjects being taught are anything but boring.  Areas we publish in include: -Latin -Ancient Greek -Logic -Writing & Rhetoric -Bible, Old & New Testament  -The Art Of Poetry -Spanish -Classical Education Resources

Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.


People have been studying Latin for a long time...  Did you know that for nearly 2,000 years most boys and girls going to school in Europe studied Latin (and usually Greek too!)when they were young students?  Children learned Latin because Latin was spoken by so many people, and because many good books were written in Latin.  The Latin language has been so popular for the last 2,000 years that many other languages have borrowed words from Latin!  Did you know that about 5 out of every 10 English words come from a Latin word?  When you learn Latin, you are also learning a good bit of English.  Here is an example: If I said, "Let ME DEMONSTRATE how the AQUARIUM IS a HABITAT for this TURTLE," we would discover that 6 out of the 12 words (capitalized) in this sentence are from Latin words.  I hope you can see that learning Latin words will be very interesting and enjoyable.  It will take some hard work, however, like anything that is really worth learning.  We will do all that we can to make learning Latin enjoyable, and help you to clearly understand everything we teach you, step by step.

Vocabulary and grammar is repeated in each chapter, and really solidifies the learning of the content.I like having the ability to quiz them, and having that capability at the end of each chapter is great.The recommended pace is suggested, which we follow. In a week, days 1-4, the lesson is introduced, vocabulary and grammar chants are memorized and reviewed. Day 5, students take the quiz.There are 7 units, and 32 chapters. One could complete this book in a school year, if that is desired. Some fellow teachers have completed it over 2 years.  We may very well take this pace instead, since it is not our sole 'foreign language'.As with any language (even one that is not spoken anymore), repetition is key, and doing the daily review is really good. There is also a section which deals with the English vocabulary from the Latin roots.  This is really essential in building a strong vocabulary.I am happy with the book, and would recommend this course.Read more

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse2.0 out of 5 starsWell-produced, but unbalancedByAmerican Elmon April 26, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseFirst, the pluses -Production is first-rate, and the book is easy to read.  The support at the website ([...]) is terrific as well, especially for flashcards.  Whatever typos that were in the first edition were corrected in the books that I got.  The authors have clearly been teaching kids for a long time, and it shows.  The text is very, very accessible.Now, the minus -I took my daughters through chapter 10, before we moved on to another book.  Why?It is just too vocabulary-intensive, without providing a context for the vocabulary.  Yes, my daughters learned the vocabulary, but they couldn't do anything with it, because there are no reading assignments to correspond to what they memorized.  In addition, there were no translation exercises.  I did not use the separate reader, also published by this author, but they don't recommend it until the first half of the book is completed, anyway.This means that kids have to go almost 12 weeks before they actually start doing simple Latin sentences, and that's too long.  More time is spent every chapter doing English derivatives from Latin, than is spent on Latin, itself.  And that's o.k. - learning Latin as an aid to learning English vocabulary is a worthy goal - it just isn't the goal that I had.Now, the good news - I really, really, really like the publisher, so I bought the Latin book that they did for older kids ("Latin Alive!).  As soon as it came, I put "Latin for Children" on the shelf.  The "Latin Alive" book strikes a much better balance.  There is actually LESS vocabulary per week than the book designed for younger kids.  Simplified grammar is presented up front, at an appropriate pace.  And, most importantly, they are reading Latin right off the bat.  "Latin Alive" also has flashcard support from "[...]".So I reluctantly would NOT recommend "Latin for Children", but am very pleased with the same publisher's book, "Latin Alive".Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat Curriculum to Teach and from which to LearnByalefon January 2, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI have taught this program for three years now, and I love it.First of all, if you are teaching Latin using this book, I highly recommend that you invest in Karen Moore's training program, found through the Classical Academic Press website.Most text books are not meant to provide all the activities a teacher will need to fully engage the children, and this is no exception.  But the CAP website has loads of free material, and Moore's training provides guidance on creating more of your own.  Which, of course, is better, because you can tailor it to where your particular students are.I teach in a 2-day-a-week school/3-day-a-week homeschool hybrid, and my own child is in her second year of LFC, and she and her classmates are all doing great, and will take the National Latin Exam this March.I have friends who are using it in a five day school, and in a five day homeschool, and it is working well in both of those settings as well.The program does not contain a lot of fluff.  It is good, hard work, which is what most classical approaches to schooling are aiming at these days.In the words of our favorite nun-turned-governess, start at the very beginning; it's a very good place to start.  Latin for Children is teaching the ABCs, Do Re Mis, 1 2 3s of the Latin language.  It is a parts-to-whole approach to Latin grammar.One note - Classical Academic Press recommends starting this program in 3rd or 4th grade.  It has been my experience that to be cheerful and successful, a child needs to be quite language-gifted to begin it in third grade.  Most fourth graders can do it with great success.  I've also used it successfully with students as old as eighth grade.Five stars all around!Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsLatin for ChildrenByKindle Customeron January 3, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis text is an excellent BEGINNING course for YOUNGER children in Latin.  It is fun, not overwhelming.  However, if you are looking to spend a lot of time and do lots of translations, this book is not for you.  It has fun games in the additional workbook and the translation book has lots of factual, interesting yet easy translations to do.  I do love translating, so I was slightly disappointed but I fixed that by just making my own.  The translations really start making sense 1/2 way through the book. I also do Latin specifically to help with English vocabulary, so this series works well for my family.  I had my older sons pick out their spelling words each week by finding English derivatives based on the Latin words for the week, so that took care of spelling in our house as well.Read more0Comment|
