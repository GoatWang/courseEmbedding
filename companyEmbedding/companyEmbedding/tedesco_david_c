David C. TedescoManaging Partner - Chief ExecutiveJeff WaltersPartner - Sales, Marketing and Product LeadJames ColyerPartner - Deal Flow and Execution LeadAndrew ChristensenPartner - General CounselChristopher ReapPartner - Deal Flow LeadZac BernPartner - IT LeadRiverwood CapitalSilicon Valley private equity firm


David Tedesco is the founder, Managing Partner and Chief Executive Officer of True North Companies.  He has overall responsibility for the firm’s strategic direction and is focused on deal origination, underwriting, deal execution, and portfolio management.  David founded True North in 2005 to bring his entrepreneurial experience to private equity investing. Unlike most private equity investors, his experience is rooted in building small companies through exceptional operations as opposed to financial engineering.
Prior to forming True North, David was a founder and CEO of multiple successful companies. He founded his first software business at age 15 and began a career as a technology entrepreneur. In 1998, David founded TeraSoft, a marketing communications company focused on the travel and hospitality industry.  TeraSoft was later sold to Lebensart Global.
Following the sale of Terasoft, David co-founded Intrasight with Jeff Walters in 2001.  Intrasight was a cloud-computing based provider of relationship marketing services to the travel and hospitality, consumer packaged goods and online services industries.  After acquiring Sansora, a competitor serving the travel industry, the partners sold Intrasight to group of VC’s led by JMI Equity to create a company now called ClickSquared.
In addition to starting various technology companies, David has been a lifelong investor in private companies and has been an active board member with for-profit and non-profit organizations. David currently serves on the boards of Anmark, Passport Health, Midwest Products, CIRS, Pro-Gard, and Global Water, among others.
David has received the Spirit of Philanthropy award and, in 2007, he formed the Tedesco Foundation, a non-profit entity focused on providing essential funding to non-profit services firms both locally and internationally. David has been recognized with many awards over the years including the Clara Barton Award for outstanding volunteer leadership and the 40 under 40 award given to the forty most influential people in Arizona under 40 years old.
David is an alumnus of Harvard Business School and is an active member of the Young Presidents’ Organization (YPO).  He is also an active photographer, outdoors enthusiast and private pilot.
