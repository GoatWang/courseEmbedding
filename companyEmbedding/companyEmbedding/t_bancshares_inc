DALLAS, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- T Acquisition, Inc. ("T Acquisition") and T Bancshares, Inc. ("T Bancshares"), the parent holding company of Dallas-based T Bank, N.A. ("T Bank"), a national banking association, jointly announced today that T Acquisition completed its acquisition of T Bancshares on May 15, 2017. T Bank will continue to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of T Bancshares following the closing.
