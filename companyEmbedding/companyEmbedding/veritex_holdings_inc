DALLAS, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Veritex Holdings, Inc. ("Veritex" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:VBTX), the holding company for Veritex Community Bank, announced today the results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. The Company reported net income of $3.6 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share (EPS), compared to $3.1 million, or $0.20 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and $3.2 million, or $0.29 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, total loans increased $101.5 million to $1.1 billion representing a 39.8% annualized growth rate. Total assets and total deposits were unchanged with balances of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2017.
Malcolm Holland, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "I am excited to report a great quarter driven by record loan production exceeding $100 million. Our loan portfolio grew 10% compared to March 31, 2017, or an annualized growth rate of 40%. Our pipelines are solid and credit quality remains a core foundational focus of our bank. Our net interest margin for the quarter was up 32 basis points over the prior quarter as we deployed excess cash into loan fundings. In addition, our loan yield was up 10 basis points over the prior quarter as we push through interest rate floors to see the benefit from Federal Reserve rate increases."
Mr. Holland continued, "We received final regulatory approval of our application to merge with Sovereign Bancorp, Inc. from the Federal Reserve on July 7, 2017 and we expect to close this transaction on or around August 1, 2017.  Over the past several months we have worked diligently alongside a third party firm to organize the integration process on this transformational merger. Thanks to the hard work of both the Sovereign and Veritex teams, we will be prepared for conversion and integration in the third quarter of 2017.  I look forward to officially welcoming Sovereign's clients, shareholders, and employees as they join the Veritex family."

•   Pre-tax income was $5.4 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 12.6%, compared to $4.8 million for the same period in 2016. Pre-tax, pre-provision income increased $1.0 million, or 19.1%, to $6.4 million compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2016.

Result of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017
Net Interest Income
For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net interest income before provision for loan losses was $12.4 million and net interest margin was 3.53% compared to $11.3 million and 3.21%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net interest income increased $1.1 million primarily due to an increase of $1.1 million in interest earned on total loans as average loans increased $62.8 million from March 31, 2017 to June 30, 2017. This increase was driven by success of our organic growth strategy during the three months ended June 30, 2017. The net interest margin increased 32 basis points from the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to a change in mix of earning assets resulting from increases in loans, which tend to yield greater interest rates than other interest earning assets such as investment securities and interest bearing deposits in other banks, and decreases in interest-bearing deposits in other banks which traditionally provide lower average yields than other interest earning assets such as loans. Average loan balances represented 76.2% of average interest-earnings assets for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 70.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Average interest-bearing deposits in other banks decreased $96.6 million and represented 14.2% of average-interest earning assets for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 20.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. In addition, the average yield on loan balances increased to 4.88% from 4.78%, investment securities increased to 2.17%, from 1.96% and interest-bearing deposits in other banks increased to 1.10% from 0.84% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the average yields for these average interest earning assets is due to increases in the targeted Federal Funds rate and the resulting impact from increases in corresponding rates for these products.
Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased by $2.1 million from $10.2 million to $12.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the same period during 2016. The increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses was primarily due to $2.0 million in increased interest income on loans resulting from average loan balance increases of $156.3 million compared to June 30, 2016. The net interest margin declined to 3.53% during the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 3.90% for the same three-month period in 2016. The 37 basis point decrease in net interest margin was partially due to a change in mix of earning assets with increases in interest-bearing deposits in other banks to $199.1 million representing 14.2% of earning assets as of June 30, 2017 compared to interest-bearing deposits in other banks of $59.5 million representing 5.6% as of the same period in 2016. Interest-bearing deposits in other banks tend to bear lower interest rates than other earning assets such as loans and investment securities. The increase in interest-bearing deposits in other banks was primarily driven by proceeds of our public offering of common stock in December 2016 and increases in customer deposits. In addition, the average interest paid on deposits increased to 0.80% for the the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 0.68% for the same period in 2016. The 12 basis point increase was related to an increase in deposit balances related to premium priced financial institution money market accounts.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $1.8 million, an increase of $231 thousand or 15.0% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The net increase was primarily from an increase in dividend income of $104 thousand as a result of bi-annual Federal Reserve Bank stock dividends received during the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased gain on sale of mortgage loans of $42 thousand and increased analysis charges and debit card fees of $46 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 grew $354 thousand or 25.1%. The increase was primarily a result of increased gains on sale of Small Business Administration loans of $285 thousand and increased debit card fees of $71 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Noninterest Expense
Noninterest expense was $7.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $332 thousand or 4.5%. The increase was primarily due to increased professional fees of $390 thousand which included legal services associated with strategic initiatives of $135 thousand, professional recruiting expenses of $112 thousand, and Sovereign merger related expenses of $41 thousand. Noninterest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2017 also increased compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to an increase in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") assessment fees of $135 thousand which were incurred as a result of a catch-up in prior period assessments, and growth in assets, a primary driver of these expenses.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $266 thousand from an increase in the deferral of direct loan origination costs.
Compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, noninterest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased $1.5 million, or 23.5%. The increase was primarily due to increased professional fees of $685 thousand for nonrecurring legal services associated with strategic initiatives and conversion planning for the Sovereign merger. Noninterest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2017 also increased compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016 due to an increase in FDIC assessment fees of $261 thousand which were incurred as a result of a catch-up in prior period assessments, and growth in assets, a primary driver of the expenses. Other noninterest expense also increased $281 thousand primarily due to an increase in dues and membership fees, insurance expense, and card transaction expense.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $1.8 million, an increase of $452 thousand, or 33.5%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company's effective tax rate, before reporting the net impact of discrete items, was approximately 34.8% and 34.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. The change in income tax expense from the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily due to the $970 thousand increase in net operating income and decrease in net discrete tax benefit from $172 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $83 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The net discrete tax benefit for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was primarily associated with the recognition of excess tax benefit realized on share-based payment awards. The Company's effective tax rate, after including the net impact of discrete tax items, was approximately 33.3% and 30.4%, respectively for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, income tax expense increased $163 thousand, or 9.9%, to $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The Company's effective tax rate, before reporting the net impact of discrete items, was approximately 34.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 34.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  There were no discrete tax items during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The change in income tax expense from the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to the increase in net operating income of $606 thousand offset by the impact of the net discrete tax benefit of $83 thousand during the three months ended June 30, 2017. The Company's effective tax rate, after including the net impact of discrete tax items, was approximately 33.3% and 34.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Financial Condition
Loans (excluding loans held for sale and deferred loan fees) at June 30, 2017 were $1.1 billion, an increase of $101.5 million or 9.9% compared to $1.0 billion at March 31, 2017. The net increase from March 31, 2017 was primarily the result of the continued execution and success of our organic growth strategy.
Loans (excluding loans held for sale and deferred loan fees) at June 30, 2017 increased $194.5 million, or 21.0%, compared to $928.0 million at June 30, 2016. The growth over June 30, 2016 is due to the continued execution and success of our organic growth strategy.
Deposits at June 30, 2017 were $1.2 billion, a decrease of $10.6 million, or 0.9%, compared to March 31, 2017. The decrease from March 31, 2017 was primarily due to the maturity of $17.5 million in certificates of deposits and $5.0 million of wholesale deposits, a decrease in interest bearing checking of $3.8 million and a decrease in money market accounts of $3.2 million which was partially offset by an increase in savings accounts of $20.0 million.
Deposits increased $183.4 million, or 17.8%, compared to $1.0 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase from June 30, 2016 was primarily due to an increase in financial institution money market accounts of $105.0 million resulting from the launch of a correspondent banking group, organic growth in retail and business money market accounts of $60.3 million, growth in savings deposits of $102.0 million, and an increase of $4.1 million in interest bearing checking. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in wholesale deposits of $53.5 million, a decrease in CDs of $17.0 million and a decrease in non-interest bearing deposits of $17.5 million.
Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank were $38.2 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $38.3 million at March 31, 2017 and $38.4 million at June 30, 2016.
Asset Quality
The allowance for loan losses was 0.87%, 0.86%, and 0.85% of total loans at June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans over the three quarter periods was determined by the qualitative factors around the nature, volume and mix of the loan portfolio. 
The provision for loan losses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $943 thousand compared to $890 thousand for three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in provision for loan losses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to March 31, 2017 was due to the general provision required from an increase in loan growth compared to the prior period. The increase of $416 thousand in provision for loan losses from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017 was due to the general provision required from an increase in loan growth compared to the same period in 2016.
Non-accrual loans were $1.5 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $1.7 million at March 31, 2017 and $1.0 million at June 30, 2016.  At June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017, non-accrual loans to our total loans held for investment was minimal at 0.13% and 0.17%, respectively.
Nonperforming assets totaled $2.0 million, or 0.13%, of total assets at June 30, 2017 compared to $2.9 million, or 0.19%, of total assets at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets were $7.2 million, or 0.59%, of total assets at June 30, 2016. The decrease of $874 thousand in nonperforming assets compared to March 31, 2017 was primarily due to decrease in other real estate owned of $505 thousand from the sale of a property in the period as well as a decrease of $369 thousand in nonperforming loans.  The decrease of $5.2 million in nonperforming assets compared to June 30, 2016 was primarily related to the payoff of a single $5.4 million loan which was classified as an accruing loan 90 or more days past due as of June 30, 2016.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The Company's management uses certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Specifically, the Company reviews and reports tangible book value per common share, the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and pre-tax, pre-provision income. The Company has included in this release information related to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented. Please refer to "Consolidated Financial Highlights" at the end of this release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures.

___________________________
Total loans does not include loans held for sale and deferred fees. Loans held for sale were $4.1 million at June 30, 2017, $1.9 million at March 31, 2017, $5.2 million at December 31, 2016, $4.9 million at September 30, 2016 and $4.8 million at June 30, 2016. Deferred fees were $40 thousand at June 30, 2017, $48 thousand at March 31, 2017, $55 thousand at December 31, 2016, $51 thousand at September 30, 2016, and $52 thousand at June 30, 2016.
We calculate our average assets and average equity for a period by dividing the sum of our total assets or total stockholders' equity, as the case may be, at the close of business on each day in the relevant period, by the number of days in the period. We have calculated our return on average assets and return on average equity for a period by dividing net income for that period by our average assets and average equity, as the case may be, for that period.
Net interest margin represents net interest income, annualized on a fully tax equivalent basis, divided by average interest-earning assets.
Efficiency ratio represents noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.
We calculate tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and we calculate tangible assets as total assets less goodwill, and core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization. Tangible common equity to tangible assets is a non-GAAP financial measure, and, as we calculate tangible common equity to tangible assets, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is total stockholders' equity to total assets. Our management believe that this measure is important to many investors in the market place who are interested in relative changes from period to period in common equity and total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing both total stockholders' equity and assets while not increasing our tangible common equity or tangible assets. See our reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the table captioned "Reconciliation GAAP —NON-GAAP-(Unaudited)."

___________________________
We calculate book value per common share as stockholders' equity at the end of the relevant period divided by the outstanding number of shares of our common stock at the end of the relevant period.
We calculate tangible book value per common share as total tangible common equity, divided by the outstanding number of shares of our common stock at the end of the relevant period. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure, and, as we calculate tangible book value per common share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is book value per common share. Our management believes that this measure is important to many investors in the market place who are interested in changes from period to period on book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets have the effect of increasing total book value while not increasing our tangible book value.

We calculate pre-tax, pre-provision income by adding the total provision for loan losses to net income from operations for the relevant period. Pre-tax pre-provision income is a non-GAAP financial measure and as we calculate pre-tax, pre-provision income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income. Our management believe that this measure is important to many investors in the market place who are interested in understanding our operating performance before provision for loan losses, which can vary from quarter to quarter, and income taxes.

 VERITEX HOLDINGS,INC. (NASDAQ:VBTX) Files An 8-K Results of Operations and Financial ConditionItem 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On July19, 2017, Veritex Holdings,Inc. (the “Company”), the holding company for Veritex Community Bank, a Texas state chartered bank, issued a press release describing its results of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017. A copy of the press release is included as Exhibit99.1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.
As provided in General Instructions B2 to Form8-K, the information furnished in Item 2.02 and Exhibit99.1 of this Current Report on Form8-K shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, and such information shall not be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
Item 8.01 Other Events
The portions of the press release that relate solely to the proposed merger between Spartan Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Sovereign Bancshares, Inc. (“Sovereign”) are being filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K in compliance with Rule 425 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d)Exhibits. The following is furnished as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form8-K:
       ExhibitNumber   Description     99.1   Press Release, dated July 19, 2017.   Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
The information presented herein and in other documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), in press releases or other public shareholder communications, or in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 giving the Company’s and Sovereign’s expectations or predictions of future financial or business performance or conditions. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” “positions,” “prospects” or “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could” or “may”, or by variations of such words or by similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we assume no duty to update forward-looking statements.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date such statements are made. These statements may relate to future financial performance, strategic plans or objectives, revenues or earnings projections, or other financial information. By their nature, these statements are subject to numerous uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the statements. Statements about the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transactions and all other statements in this communication other than historical facts constitute forward-looking statements.
The closing of the Sovereign merger is subject to customary closing conditions. There is no assurance that such conditions will be met or that the Sovereign merger will be consummated within the expected time frame, or at all. In addition to factors previously disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC and those identified elsewhere in this communication, the following factors among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements: delay in closing the Sovereign merger; difficulties and delays in integrating the Company and Sovereign businesses or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits; business disruption following the proposed transaction; changes in asset quality and credit risk; the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in interest rates and capital markets; inflation; customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; customer disintermediation; the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives; competitive conditions; the inability to realize cost savings or revenues or to implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures; economic conditions; and the impact, extent and timing of technological changes, capital management activities, and other actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms.
Additional Information About the Proposed Transaction and Where to Find It
This communication is being made in respect of the proposed merger transaction involving the Company and Sovereign. This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.
Investors and security holders are urged to carefully review and consider the Company’s public filings with the SEC, including but not limited to its Annual Reports on Form 10-K, its proxy statements, its Current Reports on Form 8-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The documents filed by the Company with the SEC may be obtained free of charge from www.veritexbank.com under the Investor Relations tab or at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, these documents, when available, can be obtained free of charge from the Company upon written request to Veritex Holdings, Inc., Attn: Investor Relations, 8214 Westchester Drive, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75225 or by calling (972) 349-6200. 
In connection with the proposed transaction, the Company has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 with the SEC which includes a joint proxy statement of Sovereign and the Company and a prospectus of the Company, and will file other documents regarding the proposed transaction with the SEC.

No Offer or Solicitation This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to sell, or the solicitation or an offer to buy any securities. There will be no sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirement of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   Special Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements reflect the current views of Veritex Holdings' management with respect to, among other things, future events and Veritex Holdings' financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as "may," "should," "could," "predict," "potential," "believe," "will likely result," "expect," "continue," "will," "anticipate," "seek," "estimate," "intend," "plan," "project," "forecast," "goal," "target," "would" and "outlook," or the negative variations of those words or other comparable words of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about Veritex Holdings' industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond Veritex Holdings' control. Accordingly, Veritex Holdings cautions you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although Veritex believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Veritex Holdings' expectations include successfully implementing its growth strategy, including identifying acquisition targets and consummating suitable acquisitions;  continuing to sustain internal growth rate; providing competitive products and services that appeal to its customers and target market; continuing to have access to debt and equity capital markets and achieving its performance goals. The foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. For discussion of these and other risks that may cause actual results to differ from expectations, please refer to "Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" in Veritex Holdings' Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2016 and any updates to those risk factors set forth in Veritex Holdings' subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. If one or more events related to these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if Veritex Holdings' underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may differ materially from what Veritex Holdings anticipates. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and Veritex does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is not possible for Veritex Holdings to predict those events or how they may affect it. In addition, Veritex cannot assess the impact of each factor on Veritex Holdings' business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that Veritex Holdings or persons acting on Veritex Holdings' behalf may issue.
