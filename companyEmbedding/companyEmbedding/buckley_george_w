Early life[edit]
George W. Buckley was born in Sheffield. He was raised by his crippled grandmother in Pitsmoor.[2]
Buckley was apprenticed as an electrician, eventually progressing to a BSc in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of Huddersfield.[3] He also holds a PhD in Engineering studied jointly at the University of Huddersfield and the University of Southampton, and an honorary DSc in Engineering from the University of Huddersfield.[4]
Career[edit]
Buckley came to 3M from Brunswick Corporation where he served as chairman and chief executive officer since June 2000. Prior to leading Brunswick, Buckley was with Emerson Electric Company as the president of its U.S.-based Electrical Motors Division and the Automotive and Precision Motors Division. He also served as chief technology officer for Emerson’s worldwide group of motor and appliance-related businesses.
In a 2009 letter to 3M shareholders, George W. Buckley discussed the actions he had taken in response to the economic climate, including cutting jobs. Buckley remarked that the layoffs that would number "as many as necessary but as few as possible," as well as how 3M "used furloughs, pay cuts, overtime bans, mandatory vacations and stringent incidental cost control to limit the number of layoffs, but in the end some were needed." He reassured shareholders that "In a 5% recession there is still 95% of the business left and winning an increasing share of that business has to be our focus.".[5]
While CEO of 3M in 2008, Buckley earned a total compensation of $12,182,410; which included a base salary of $1,720,000; a cash bonus of $2,844,074; stocks granted of $4,002,421; options granted of $3,363,492; and other compensation of $252,423.[6] In 2009, George Buckley earned a total compensation of $13,992,628, which included a base salary of $1,720,000, a cash bonus of $3,859,112, stocks granted worth $4,333,655, options granted of $3,757,572, and other compensation of $322,289.[6]
Buckley was knighted in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to industry.[7][8]

NYSE:MMM 







  "We thank George for his exemplary leadership over the last six years" 



ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--3M (NYSE: MMM) announced today that Inge G. Thulin is elected president 
      and CEO, effective Feb. 24. He succeeds Sir George W. Buckley, chairman, 
      president and CEO, who will retire on June 1.
    

      Thulin immediately becomes a member of 3M’s Board of Directors and 
      Buckley remains chairman of the board until the Annual Meeting of 
      Stockholders on May 8, at which time the board intends to elect Thulin 
      to the position of chairman.
    

      Speaking for the 3M Board, Vance D. Coffman, lead director said, "Inge 
      is a proven leader with a terrific blend of strategic, business and 
      analytical skills, and an excellent record of delivering both sales 
      growth and operational efficiency in a wide range of global businesses. 
      His strengths will serve 3M well and ensure that the company remains on 
      a strong growth track driven by innovation for many years to come."
    

      Thulin, 58, has served as chief operating officer since May 2011, with 
      responsibility for 3M’s six business segments and International 
      Operations. Prior to that, he was executive vice president of 
      International Operations. Under his leadership, international sales grew 
      to nearly $20 billion and today represent two-thirds of 3M’s sales. 
      Thulin also has held numerous leadership positions in Asia Pacific, 
      Europe and Middle East and across multiple businesses.
    

      Thulin holds degrees in Marketing and Economics from Gothenburg 
      University. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of The Toro 
      Company.
    

      Buckley was appointed 3M’s chairman, president and CEO in Dec. 2005. He 
      led the company’s successful effort to reinvigorate growth and 
      innovation, which culminated in an all-time high $30 billion in sales in 
      2011, with new product sales now comprising nearly one-third of total 
      sales.
    

      "We thank George for his exemplary leadership over the last six years," 
      said Coffman. "He achieved tremendous results for the company and 
      navigated 3M successfully through one of the toughest economic times in 
      recent history."

      them into thousands of ingenious products. Our culture of creative

George Buckley: From Yorkshire slum to American Dream

Born to Sheffield poverty, he made his fortune in the US. Now he’s back in the old country with a lesson to teach, says Margareta Pagano

Sir George Buckley has a new, third, wife, eight children, and homes in Minnesota, Chicago, Florida and Derbyshire. He also has around 1,000 Dinky toy cars, some 150 miniature railway engines, three classic cars – including two Jaguar E-types and an Austin Healey Mk III – and is about to buy the latest Jaguar F-type, in metallic black with black trimmings. Sir George tells me all this within minutes of our meeting. Then he reads out a text that he sent recently to his American wife, Donna.  It goes something like this: “I’ve fallen in love again; she has the most wonderful and curvaceous body ...” You get the drift? If you are wondering who on earth is this Flash Harry with a taste for the fast life, then stop; no more assumptions. There’s an explanation for his apparent extravagance; as Sir George the engineer might say, there is a cause and effect. The new passion in his life is the F-type and the text to Donna was a teasing warning that he is going to splash out on another car. He has had several wives not because of a roguish eye but because his first wife died, leaving him with five young children. Then came the second blow when his second wife, with whom he had twin girls, asked him for a divorce and told him he was boring. “Actually, she didn’t say boring but that I was uninteresting, which I guess means the same thing. “Once I got over the heartbreak, I took a hard look at myself: I don’t smoke, I don’t drink, I don’t gamble, I don’t look at another woman unless I’m with her. I don’t do any crazy things – I love history, fly-fishing and cars. Maybe she was right, I am boring,” he says, laughing at himself now.She must have got the wrong guy. For the Yorkshireman eating his English breakfast in front of me has had the sort of fairytale life the Brothers Grimm would have struggled to conjure. He’s also unlike any industrialist I’ve met – funny, self-deprecating and kind. Born in poverty, abandoned as a baby by his mother and beset with health problems, he left his Sheffield school for the physically handicapped at 15 without a single qualification and no job to go to. Fast forward a few decades and he had become one of the UK’s most successful exports to the US and the only Brit to run an American Fortune 500 company.  With a reputation for turnarounds, he was hired to be chairman, chief executive and president of 3M, one of the most innovative industrial companies in the world, the maker of Post-it and Scotch tape. Today 3M has sales of $30bn (£19bn) and employs 88,000 people. Sir George retired last summer after seven years and is a millionaire many times over.The reason we are here at Simpson’s restaurant on the Strand in central London is that Sir George  is crossing the Atlantic to do “something good for the old country”. He is the new chairman of Smiths Group, one of the UK’s few engineering companies of world-class status. Next to 3M, Smiths is a tiddler, with sales of £3.1bn and 23,000 workers, yet they are both conglomerate in style and have technological innovation at their core. Smiths, he says, has great potential for growth, which is something he also sees in the wider British economy, though he worries it will remain unfulfilled. “The government is well meaning but tinkering at the edges. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a socialist, but we need big, Roosevelt-style, investment in infrastructure: parks, highways, schools, hospitals – even dry walls. There are three ways to achieve wealth: manufacturing, digging it out of the ground and growing it. More effort needs to be put into our manufacturing and engineering base. “It’s a big problem. Sadly, engineering is not sexy; the industry doesn’t have a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett. So we need to find other ways to excite the young about innovation.” For Sir George, the biggest priority is to get youth unemployment down, apprenticeships up and the young trained in new skills.Learning was his escape: “Endeavour, curiosity and a fear of not being able to survive and compete was what drove me. Once I had the chance to study, I loved the maths, the science and finding out how things work.”  His turning point came by chance. Soon after leaving school he became an apprentice to a local electrician and one day went to work on a site where he was introduced to an electrical punch list. The foreman asked him if he understood how the strength of cabling required for different functions was calculated. “I was totally lost. I realised I didn’t know the most fundamental things about the trade I had chosen ...  I knew I had to do something.” He persuaded his employers to send him to college and ﻿gained a degree in electrical and electronic engineering. He moved to the US in his early 30s after being offered a job by General Motors, in Detroit, and then worked for Detroit Edison and the Emerson Electric Company. After a brief sojourn in the UK with British Rail, he was lured back to head the Brunswick Corporation based in Chicago.He plans to continue the “snowbird” migration – Florida in winter and Minnesota in the summer – with about a week a month in the UK, spending as much time as he can at his old vicarage at Sheen in Derbyshire, the place where he wants to be buried – “standing up so I can keep looking out at what’s going on”.  It’s also where his trains and toys are stored: “Whenever I get apologetic about having so many, Ivan, who owns the antique shop where I buy them, tells me, ‘It’s never too late to have a good childhood’.” So is he still making up for his own tough one? “Maybe.  We were terribly poor yet I never felt underprivileged.” His “philanderer” father left when he was born and his mother soon after. He grew up in his grandmother’s house, a rooming property with about 30 displaced people – Poles, Italians and soldiers back from the war. “It was a Sheffield slum dwelling – there was one gas ring and an outside toilet.” A family living in the house looked after him and became his foster-parents. When he was 11, his mother came back to reclaim him. “ My blessed foster mother had died when I was eight so my foster father looked after me. I was devastated to be taken away from him and I still remember looking up at the house the day I left believing that no one loved me.” It’s why he so clearly adores his own children.  It’s now Sir George’s turn to ask a question.  “Do you want to know why I have been successful? It’s proof God has a sense of humour.” The CV: Sir George BuckleyAge: 66. Education: Degree in electrical engineering from Huddersfield Polytechnic and Phd from Southampton and Huddersfield universities in steel-making.Present jobs: Chairman-elect of Smiths Group, director of Hitachi and PepsiCo, and chairman of private equity firm Arle Capital Partners.Reading: Antony Beevor’s ‘Stalingrad’.Favourite film: ‘The Princess Bride.’Hobbies: Cars, reading history and cleaning the house.

ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--3M (NYSE:MMM) announced today that George W. Buckley has been elected 
      chairman, president and chief executive officer, effective immediately. 
      He succeeds interim chairman and CEO Robert S. Morrison, who has led the

      Division. He also served as chief technology officer for Emerson's

      businesses," said Morrison. "His strengths complement perfectly 3M's 
      culture of innovation and operating effectiveness."
    

      Buckley currently serves on the Board of Directors of Ingersoll-Rand 
      Company Ltd., Tyco Corporation and Thule AB.
    

      "I am blessed to have worked at two great companies and am honored to be 
      chosen to lead a third," said Buckley. "3M's technology base and its 
      innovative culture are renowned and I'm excited to be part of the 3M 
      team. I'm especially impressed with the outstanding leadership in the 
      company and look forward to working with them."
    

      Speaking for the 3M Board, Edward A. Brennan said, "We thank Bob 
      Morrison for his tremendous leadership over the last six months. He 
      helped keep the company on course after our change of leadership last 
      July, and as a result, the company today is stronger."
    

      George W. Buckley and Patrick D. Campbell, senior vice president and 
      chief financial officer, will conduct an investor teleconference at 
      11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central) on Thurs., Dec. 8. Access
