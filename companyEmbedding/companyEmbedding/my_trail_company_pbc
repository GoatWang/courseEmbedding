	           Invest »


















	         My Trail makes high performance, lightweight outdoor apparel and equipment and sells it directly to our Customers to keep it affordable.


	         Investment in My Trail Company earns 10% annual dividends, paid in cash or accrued from year to year and paid upon a liquidation or redemption.  Investors also receive a 20% discount on product purchases.


	         Through Spring, 2017, over 350 Customers invested over $840,000 through this Colorado Direct Public Offering (DPO) and a parallel raise from Customers outside Colorado on Wefunder.com/mytrail.  These investments funded production of core apparel and equipment styles, the launch of mytrailco.com, hiring staff, and opening a distribution center and our flagship store on Pearl Street in Boulder.


	         Additional capital raised will help us produce:


14 additional down insulated styles including our very lightest 850-fill favorites for Fall 2017.
10 additional Pyramid shelter and accessory styles.
6 new light, ultralight and hyperlight backpacks.
Our lightest wind shells, softshells, baselayers, and complimentary accessories from other brands.

456GoLite is coming back as My Trail Company (self.Ultralight)submitted 1 year ago by noahfencetakenI drank GoLite's kool-aid for years and was bummed when they went out of business last year.  Looks like there is an attempt to resurrect the designs and make them available.
From an email:
*Do you miss great outdoor apparel and equipment at great prices? With your help, My Trail Company will bring them back!
My Trail Company is a new Colorado based outdoor retailer with a product line 17 years in the making.  We have acquired all of GoLite’s award winning designs to bring the most popular products back.  From the start this will include the best of the packs, tents, storm shells, down jackets and other favorites.
Please join others who have already invested in My Trail Company’s Direct Public Offer (DPO).  We need to raise a minimum of $500,000 to produce the first wave of products to sell online.  Investments over this amount will allow us to broaden the product assortment, accelerate innovation, add relevant accessories, and open our first stores.  As thanks for playing a pivotal role at this early stage, investors will earn dividends and receive discounts as detailed in the offering materials.
Please invest to help us bring to market the very best lightweight, functional outdoor clothing and equipment, at down-to-earth prices.  When you do, My Trail Company will become your trail company too.  And, if you have friends who might want to invest, please spread the word.
Thank you!
Demetri Coupounas
Co-Founder, My Trail Company, PBC
P.S. For regulatory reasons, My Trail Company investment is only open to Colorado residents and Colorado headquartered organizations.  When products arrive, they will of course be available to everyone.*

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]joy_of_division 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago (0 children)I honestly hope that it doesn't go through. They made bad business decisions, failed, went bankrupt, and now are asking people to invest in their new company. I just don't buy into it. Tons of other lightweight companies out there that have made smart decisions to stay small, and still offered prices close to that or better than golite.

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]rusty075 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (0 children)Seems like Coup has missed the memo on the whole Maker Movement and the cottage industry explosion.  He wants half a million for off-shore procurement and brick and mortar stores, when he should be looking for local sewers and setting up a website. 
This just seems like a very old-fashioned idea.  

permalinkembedsavegive gold[–]kinohead 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (0 children)Just bought a Pertex rain jacket from another company at double the weight and price of the golite.  Hope this materializes.

Maybe that can become a reality, still.

THE BUZZ ABOUT MY TRAIL




Loved the company GoLite. Have the jam 70 which has held up fantastic. Looks like the new products are made of the same stellar materials. Was so sad a few years ago when I went to order their classic green peak tent only to find the company had went out of business. So happy their back! Now I get to save up again for the tent!

                  What are you building?
                  



MyTrail is a new company that’s starting with tremendous assets from GoLite, a company that was in the outdoors market space for 16 years. GoLite did a lot of things well and had a great following in 23 different countries selling people's favorite ultralight collection of outdoor gear: packs, shelters, sleeping bags, outerwear, mid layers, base layers and accessories. But GoLite isn’t around anymore because it opened physical stores that were too large and too costly to operate, and added a large casual product line that was unprofitable.With MyTrail, we're taking all of those wonderful Customers and products of GoLite and concentrating on only the best and most popular clothing and equipment. Essentially we're doing what was working and not doing what wasn't working. We’re reclaiming the role of worldwide industry leader in lightweight outdoor gear.




                  What makes your brand different?
                  



The heart and soul of MyTrail is making products that not only function well and are durable, but are also so light and compact that you can forget about the gear and remember why you went outside to begin with. The second central element that the outdoor industry hardly addresses is delivering that premium, lightweight equipment in as economical a way as possible.

We don't want our brand to be a badge worn at cocktail parties. We want our gear to be the lightest, most effective, and most affordable for the quality.




                  How do you achieve affordability for customers?
                  



We sell directly to customers. By avoiding the traditional wholesale channel, we eliminate the extraneous expenses. And the savings we make from avoiding the middleman is passed onto customers.

The traditional wholesale model requires companies to make samples many months in advance that cost a lot to develop and produce. Companies also have to attend trade shows in other states and countries. A booth at a large trade show can cost as much as a house.  And rep commissions cost a lot and wholesalers pass that cost on to the Customer also.




                  What kind of advantages does your business model give you?
                  



By avoiding the wholesale channel we are making products that people actually like and want. There are no gatekeepers involved. We hear from Customers themselves what innovation they’re craving, what makes sense for them. And we can make it for them.

Seeing the end customer enjoy our work is what we care about.




                  What makes your equipment special?
                  



When people first walk into an outdoor store and look at the various equipment, apparel and accessories, the only cost they see is its price. They buy what they want, take it outdoors and use it. Then they realize that the most important cost isn’t actually price, but the gear’s weight, and secondarily its bulk.  Those are the costs you pay not just once, but with every single step on every single trip.  Heavy, overbuilt gear ruins your trip.

We concentrate on making the lightest gear possible by eliminating extraneous elements. Thoughtful design is lightweight and durable. Our mission is to make gear elegantly simple and so light users forget they’re even carrying a load on their back and can focus on enjoying the outdoors.




                  What sets you apart from competitors?
                  



First, our relentless focus on making our products as light and packable as possible while delivering supreme performance and solid durability.  Second, our direct-to-consumer sales model that allows us to eliminate many traditional costs and deliver products affordably to Customers.  Internally, we call this combination “great products at great prices” which is what virtually all Customers want.  And we will deliver great products at great prices over a wide range of outdoor product categories from packs to tents to sleeping bags to technical outerwear, mid layers, base layers, and accessories which creates uncommon synergy and allows new Customers to transform their overnight loads from the typical 30+ pounds to less than 10.




                  What are the companies who are making competing products?
                  



There are many companies in the Outdoor market.  Most are small with narrow product lines.  There are also a few larger brands that make products in all the categories My Trail will make products in.  In the U.S.,  these include The North Face and REI.  While there are other brands whose products are as high performance as My Trail’s, and some that make products as sustainably as My Trail, none achieve the combination of light weight and low cost that My Trail does.




                  Tell us about the market.
                  



The outdoor recreation market is worth $646 billion in the U.S. annually and the market specifically for outdoor clothing and equipment is $35 billion.  Combined, leading international markets are even greater than these US figures.




                  Why dedicate the last 20 years of your career to this niche?
                  



I want more people to go out and not only experience, but truly enjoy the outdoors. The way it is now, traveling outdoors can be a hassle and a buzzkill for ordinary folks. Lugging around heavy, overbuilt gear isn’t fun.  We want to take that experience and remove the burden. You should enjoy the outdoors, the relationships you make with others and the natural beauty all around you.I’ve experienced the over-burdened trip. And I've also experienced the joy of going light and not noticing the load on my back at all. Everyone I know who has had that experience of going light goes out more often, enjoys it much more, and is refreshed and excited each time.




                  What are you selling right now?
                  



We start selling our most popular packs, shelters and accessories in late May, and our most popular down jackets and parkas in July.




                  How are you tackling manufacturing?
                  



The final cut-and-sew for our first products is concentrated at leading manufacturers in Vietnam and China. Historically, the products we're making have had plenty of inputs and cut-and-sew in the United States, Canada, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, France and other countries.

We are also working with a strategic partner based in New Jersey that has a global management footprint in outdoor production. They work with large customers including Under Armour, for which they were the first outside supplier. Using their suppliers, we’ve saved about 1% on equipment and about 10% on apparel costs while marginally improving product quality which was already very high. That cost savings allow us to have a healthier and stronger company while delivering terrific value to our Customers.




                  What do the margins look like on your products generally?
                  



We go into a season with average starting margins in the 60% range, which is very high for our industry. Discounts to Investors, our team, and group purchases will reduce that by several points and we have modeled a 55% margin into our finances. We think we can beat that every season.




                  How do you plan to activate current customers and acquire new ones?
                  



We start with over 15 Customers on our email list for every item we have produced for our 1st 6-month season, so our early focus is on serving current Customers by making the products they like most and letting them know when they arrive.  Even in our 3rd year we plan to make fewer items than we have Customers to buy them.  Our 1st 5 years our main focus on acquiring new Customers will be via word-of –mouth.




                  What lessons from GoLite are you bringing into MyTrail?
                  



The biggest are (1) to make only the products that truly matter to our Customers, the technical apparel and equipment that sold best and was solidly profitable; and (2) to sell those core product groups online, and in small stores modeled on the smallest of GoLite’s stores, which was the reliably profitable size.  Others are detailed in our Investor Presentation video.




                  Tell us about the team and why you’re the people to make this happen.
                  



MyTrail is starting small with a very tight team. So far, there’s Kale Klontz, our Chief Operating Officer. Kale's terrific at retail operations, hiring and management. And we’ve added Thomas Dangerfield as our Chief Marketing Officer. Thomas was actually one of our earliest investors so he brings his knowledge not only of how to build our brand as an expert, but as a user.

We have 4 great outside Directors on our board who have already added lots of value in sourcing, merchandising and strategy.




                  What are the big risks? What keeps you up at night?
                  



We’ve worked hard to manage away most risk by making only our best selling and most profitable products, and selling them in only the universally profitable store formats: online, and small physical footprint (under 1200 square feet).  Our focus is and will remain on excellent execution of this basic formula. By nature I don’t sleep a lot anyway, so I wouldn't say that keeps me up at night, but that's what I work on at night.




                  Why allow your customers to invest in your business?
                  



Any business benefits from having investors who truly care about it and understand it.  They’re the ones best positioned to point out both pitfalls to avoid and opportunities to seize. We’ve had over 125 Customers invest so far in Colorado and they’ve suggested great ideas, posed key questions, and provided contacts that have proven very useful. It’s been a joy.

I look forward to experiencing that more and more as this base of Customers-turned-Investors expands beyond Colorado to the rest of the country.

Risks Specific to My Trail


1.
                  MY TRAIL IS A NEW COMPANY WITH A SHORT OPERATING HISTORYMy Trail incorporated April 9, 2015 and its first products arrived in late May 2016.  Therefore we have little direct operating history for an investor to evaluate.  There is no assurance that we will ever produce a profit.  As a new enterprise, we may be subject to risks our management has not anticipated.  It is possible that the proceeds from this offering may not be sufficient for us to continue to finance our operations.
                

2.
                  MY TRAIL MAY FAIL FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR REASONS THAT GOLITE FAILEDMy Trail’s founders previously started GoLite, and the products that My Trail plans to sell and the markets in which My Trail plans to operate are similar to products that GoLite sold and the markets in which GoLite operated.  Although GoLite grew for a period of time, it was not able to attain profitability and was forced to file a petition in bankruptcy court and ultimately liquidated its assets, with owners of the company, the founders, losing all of their investment.  There is no guarantee that My Trail will succeed where GoLite failed or that the founders have learned and can apply every critical lesson from their experience at GoLite.
                

3.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT ATTRACT OR RETAIN A STRONG ENOUGH TEAMMy Trail employs 4 people, each of whom have broad responsibilities.  There is no guarantee that the Company will attract an adequately strong team in all key functional areas over time.  Until scale allows for solid hires in all key functional areas, generalists, in some cases working with outside parties, will have to continue to successfully manage design, development, sourcing, marketing, sales, e-commerce, store operations, customer service, information technology, human resources, distribution, and finance, which could result in inefficiencies and mistakes.  Attracting, hiring and developing each team member into a high performer will take time, and there is no guarantee of success.
                

4.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT ATTRACT ENOUGH CUSTOMERSMy Trail may not be able to convert an adequate portion of its email list of previous GoLite customers into My Trail customers.  Even if it does, there is no guarantee that adequate numbers of new customers will be attracted in the future.
                

5.
                  MY TRAIL SALES ARE WEATHER AND MACRO-ECONOMY DEPENDENTLike other outdoor companies, My Trail sales are subject to the influence of weather.  Early sales will be concentrated in the United States in general and Colorado in particular and may fluctuate with large climactic events and/or persistent trends.  Sales can also be affected by the normal cyclicality of the overall economy, and particularly by any abnormally large decline in it.
                

6.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPETE IN THE OUTDOOR INDUSTRYMany companies provide products similar to ours.  My Trail will compete with established businesses that have an operating history, and greater financial resources, experience and market share than we have.  There is no guarantee that we will be able to compete or capture adequate market share.  We will not be profitable if we cannot compete successfully with other businesses.  Cash flow may be tight early on with a limited margin for error.
                

7.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT DEVELOP COMPELLING ENOUGH PRODUCTSWhile My Trail starts with a full line of product designs, many styles need to be refreshed periodically, new styles have to be added and some styles retired each season.  There is no guarantee that this process will result in an attractive enough product offering over time.  Much of the design work may be performed by outside contractors over whom we have little control.
                

8.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SOURCE ITS PRODUCTS RELIABLY OR AFFORDABLY ENOUGHMy Trail could face unexpected product cost increases that make its economic model unviable.  Delays in production, shipping, or customs clearance could materially impact product delivery and thus customer experience and cash flow.  Product can be lost or damaged in transit.  Product that is designed, developed or assembled poorly could adversely affect sales due to poor quality, fit or color selection.  Our products may not meet the sustainability standards that we claim they will meet, which could result in harm to our reputation.
                

9.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTAIN OPERATING COSTS ADEQUATELYSufficiently economical store and headquarters locations may not be available, key staff could cost more than budgeted and unanticipated costs may arise.  Cash flow may be impacted by a failure to get reasonable terms from landlords, product and other suppliers.
                

10.
                  THERE IS NO MARKET IN MY TRAIL SHARES AND NO GUARANTEE THAT INVESTORS WILL REALIZE ANY RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENTThere is currently no, and there may never be any, secondary market trading in the Preferred Stock, and investors’ ability to sell their shares are further limited by transfer restrictions under applicable securities laws and the terms of the agreement for the Preferred Stock.  The primary exit event contemplated by this investment is a right for investors to cause the Company to redeem their shares after 5 years.  However, there is no guarantee that the Company will still be operating in 5 years or, even if it is still operating, that it will be legally permitted to redeem investors shares at that time (especially if multiple investors request redemption at or around the same time), or at any time thereafter, and the Company will not be required to redeem any shares to the extent that it is not legally permitted to do so.  The Company is not required to, and there is no guarantee that the Company will, pay dividends in any future year.
                

11.
                  MY TRAIL’S DIRECTORS ARE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER FACTORS OTHER THAN SHAREHOLDER RETURNS.My Trail is a Public Benefit Corporation, and accordingly its directors have a legal duty to balance the pecuniary interests of shareholders, the best interests of those materially affected by the Company’s conduct and the specific public benefits identified in the Company’s articles of incorporation.  Therefore, the Company’s directors may, consistent with their legal duties, take actions that are contrary to the financial interest of its preferred shareholders, and its preferred shareholders will have no recourse against the Company or its directors for taking such actions.
                

12.
                  THE INVESTMENT INVOLVES TAX RISKSNo representation or warranty of any kind is made by the Company, its officers, directors or counsel, or any other professional advisors thereto, with respect to any tax consequences of any investment in the Company.  EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR SHOULD SEEK THE INVESTOR’S OWN TAX ADVICE CONCERNING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY.
                

13.
                  OUR PRODUCTS COULD CAUSE BODILY INJURY OR HARM TO PROPERTY.Although we believe our products will be safe, depending on the manner in which they are manufactured and/or used, our products could cause bodily injury or harm to property (and even if such injury or harm is not actually caused by our products, people could claim that our products caused such injury or harm).  In the event that any such harm is caused (or claimed to be caused) by our products, there could be lawsuits against the Company that are costly to defend and/or result in costly settlements or judgments against the Company.
                

14.
                  MY TRAIL MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE AND ENFORCE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.The Company’s ability to compete against other businesses selling similar products depends on its ability to secure and enforce trademark and other intellectual property rights.  However, there is no guarantee that any trademark or other applications we have filed, or may in the future file will be approved, and even registrations that receive approval could subsequently be held invalid due to our conduct or challenges by third parties.  Similarly, we could lose valuable trade secret rights if we fail to properly protect our confidential information.  Even to the extent that our intellectual property rights are valid, enforcing those rights could involve costly legal processes that we may not be able to bring to a successful conclusion.
                

15.
                  MY TRAIL OR ITS PRODUCTS COULD BE SUBJECT TO UNANTICIPATED REGULATIONS.Although to management’s knowledge the Company and its products are not currently subject to any material regulation, there could be existing regulations that management is not aware of, and new regulations affecting the Company’s business or products could be adopted in the future.  Any such regulations could be costly or impossible for the Company to comply with.
                

16.
                  THE OFFERING PRICE IS ARBITRARY.The offering price of $5.00 per share is arbitrary and bears no relationship to any established value criteria (such as net tangible assets or a multiple of earnings per share) and accordingly should not be considered as an indication of the actual value of the Company.
                

17.
                  MY TRAIL COULD BE HELD TO VIOLATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.Although the Company is not aware of any third party rights that are infringed by our existing or contemplated business activities, we have not performed any freedom to operate analyses (other than standard trademark searches related to the “My Trail” mark), and there is no guarantee that we will not be sued for infringement by third parties or that we will not need to modify our brand or products to avoid infringement.
                

18.
                  WE MAY REVISE THE MANNER IN WHICH WE USE THE PROCEEDS OF THIS OFFERING.Management will have significant flexibility in applying the proceeds of this offering.  The failure of management to apply such funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.
                

19.
                  MY TRAIL’S SHAREHOLDER VOTING RIGHTS ARE CLOSELY HELD BY ONE FAMILYExcept as required by law, the Preferred Stock has no voting rights and all shareholder voting rights belong to holders of Common Stock.  In addition, pursuant to the subscription agreement for the Preferred Stock, holders of Preferred Stock are required to vote their shares in favor of certain sale of the Company transactions and certain amendments to the Company’s articles of incorporation, to the extent that such actions are approved by the board of directors and holders of Common Stock.  Demetri and Kim Coupounas and a trust for the benefit of their children own 100% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock and consequently are able to elect all of the directors and generally control all aspects of the company’s vision and strategy.  Investors must rely on the Common Stock holders to elect qualified directors and otherwise make strategic decisions that will enable the Company to succeed.

My Trail Company: New Company Launch 

Recently, Hikers Review got the opportunity to communicate by e-mail with Kale Klontz from My Trail Company. Mr. Klontz was a key member of the former outdoor equipment company GoLite. In the fall of 2014 GoLite ran into financial difficulties due to poor economic conditions that forced GoLite to file for Chapter 11.
For those that are familiar with the backpacking and hiking scene will recognize the GoLite logo and variety of high quality outdoor equipment. Some of their most popular items offered by GoLite were the Imogene tents, Jam Pack backpacks and the Chrome Dome umbrella. Of which Hikers Review will be releasing product reviews on both Imogene and Chrome Dome umbrellas. We will identify reasonable replacements on our website due to the inability to obtain these items from the former company GoLite.

It’s important to note that the new business “My Trail Company” is operated separately from the former GoLite Company, with no financial ties. My Trail Company will be operating with new staff and business partners even though they will retain many of the same intellectual properties that the former GoLite Company previously used for their products. So, what does this mean for the consumer and GoLite fans? In general this means that majority of the favorite products will return to the market under a new company and product name, but with no association with GoLite.
My Trail Company will have a focus on lightweight outdoor equipment, according to Mr. Klontz, “that will help consumers have more fun on the trail.” With the main focuses on activities such as backpacking, hiking, skiing, running and fitness that can be used by the extremely dedicated to the weekend trail casuals. For people worried about seeing a return of a favorite design or be the first to show-off the new My Trail Company hiking equipment, you will have to keep waiting. “We are working with fabric suppliers and manufactures to determine what specific designs and products can be produced initially.  The number of styles and units in the first few productions will depend greatly on our initial capital raised, and what negotiations we are able to make on minimum order sizes.”
Want to help support the next outdoor apparel company? Mr. Klontz said, “there is much work in progress, and many details yet to complete, such as a capital raised through crowd funding DPO (Direct Public Offering) that will launch in the coming weeks, and may take several months – available to Colorado residents only.”   Sorry, America, it looks like you need to sit back and wait for Colorado to fund the start of My Trail Company. Hikers Review will continue to follow up on new developments and share any Crowd Funding/Kick Starter opportunities available to the public.

This format is exactly why GoLite went under.  Poor business decisions, not poor economic conditions.  Ha, good luck

Here’s to hoping that the new product lines are more equipment related than apparel.  Equipment was GoLite’s strong points.  And apparel is what got them into trouble.  Thanks for reading.
