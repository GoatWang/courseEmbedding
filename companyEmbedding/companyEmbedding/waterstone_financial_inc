WAUWATOSA, Wis., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ:   WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income per diluted share of $0.32 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents a 10.3% increase compared to net income per diluted share of $0.29 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Net income per diluted share was $0.55 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.43 for the six months ended June 30, 2016.








"We are pleased with our strong results in the second quarter," said Douglas Gordon, CEO of Waterstone Financial, Inc. "We generated a record $13.5 million in consolidated quarterly pretax income, which represents a 10.0% increase over prior year comparable quarter. The Community Banking segment continued to have strong loan growth and improved net interest margin during the quarter.  The Mortgage Banking segment achieved a quarterly record of $737.9 million in loan originations this quarter which represents a 9.3% growth rate over the second quarter of 2016."
Highlights of the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017
Waterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)

Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $8.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $7.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $15.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Consolidated return on average assets totaled 1.99% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 1.78% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Consolidated return on average assets totaled 1.77% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 1.34% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Declared and paid a special dividend of $0.50 per share during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

Community Banking Segment 

Pre-tax income of the segment totaled $6.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents a 45.5% increase compared to $4.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Net interest income totaled $12.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents a 24.8% increase compared to $10.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income, which was driven by loan growth and a decrease in borrowing costs, drove our net interest margin to 3.00% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.50% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Average loans held for investment totaled $1.20 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents an increase of $89.3 million, or 8.0% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. Total loans increased $47.9 million, or 4.1%, to $1.23 billion at June 30, 2017 compared to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2016. 
Interest expense on borrowings decreased $1.5 million to $2.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $3.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the average cost of borrowings that resulted from the maturity and replacement of fixed rate borrowings since the beginning of the prior year. The average cost of borrowings totaled 2.26% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 3.88% during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Driven by margin expansion and continued cost control efforts, the efficiency ratio for the segment improved to 48.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 57.6% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Nonperforming assets as percentage of total assets decreased to 0.71% as of June 30, 2017, compared to 0.76% at March 31, 2017 and 1.11% at June 30, 2016.

Mortgage Banking Segments

Pre-tax income of the segment totaled $6.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents an 11.5% decrease compared to $7.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Loans originated for the purpose of sale in the secondary market increased $62.8 million, or 9.3%, to $737.9 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $675.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The increase in originations was driven by an increase in the origination of loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, which yield a higher margin than refinance loans, along with an increase in the origination of mortgage refinance products. Origination efforts continue to be focused on loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, as opposed to mortgage refinance. Origination volume relative to purchase activity improved and accounted for 91.7% originations for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 88.5% of total originations for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
Gross margins on loans sold decreased approximately 5% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016.

Announces Results of Operations for the Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017PR NewswireJuly 26, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareWAUWATOSA, Wis., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Waterstone Financial, Inc. (WSBF), holding company for WaterStone Bank, reported net income per diluted share of $0.32 for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents a 10.3% increase compared to net income per diluted share of $0.29 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  Net income per diluted share was $0.55 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income per diluted share of $0.43 for the six months ended June 30, 2016."We are pleased with our strong results in the second quarter," said Douglas Gordon, CEO of Waterstone Financial, Inc. "We generated a record $13.5 million in consolidated quarterly pretax income, which represents a 10.0% increase over prior year comparable quarter. The Community Banking segment continued to have strong loan growth and improved net interest margin during the quarter.  The Mortgage Banking segment achieved a quarterly record of $737.9 million in loan originations this quarter which represents a 9.3% growth rate over the second quarter of 2016."Highlights of the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017Waterstone Financial, Inc. (Consolidated)Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $8.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $7.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Consolidated net income of Waterstone Financial, Inc. totaled $15.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $11.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Consolidated return on average assets totaled 1.99% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 1.78% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Consolidated return on average assets totaled 1.77% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 1.34% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Declared and paid a special dividend of $0.50 per share during the quarter ended June 30, 2017.Community Banking SegmentPre-tax income of the segment totaled $6.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents a 45.5% increase compared to $4.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Net interest income totaled $12.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents a 24.8% increase compared to $10.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net interest income, which was driven by loan growth and a decrease in borrowing costs, drove our net interest margin to 3.00% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 2.50% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Average loans held for investment totaled $1.20 billion during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents an increase of $89.3 million, or 8.0% over the comparable quarter in the prior year. Total loans increased $47.9 million, or 4.1%, to $1.23 billion at June 30, 2017 compared to $1.18 billion at December 31, 2016. Interest expense on borrowings decreased $1.5 million to $2.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $3.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the average cost of borrowings that resulted from the maturity and replacement of fixed rate borrowings since the beginning of the prior year. The average cost of borrowings totaled 2.26% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 3.88% during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Driven by margin expansion and continued cost control efforts, the efficiency ratio for the segment improved to 48.8% for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to 57.6% for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Nonperforming assets as percentage of total assets decreased to 0.71% as of June 30, 2017, compared to 0.76% at March 31, 2017 and 1.11% at June 30, 2016.Mortgage Banking SegmentsPre-tax income of the segment totaled $6.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which represents an 11.5% decrease compared to $7.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Loans originated for the purpose of sale in the secondary market increased $62.8 million, or 9.3%, to $737.9 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to $675.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The increase in originations was driven by an increase in the origination of loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, which yield a higher margin than refinance loans, along with an increase in the origination of mortgage refinance products. Origination efforts continue to be focused on loans made for the purpose of residential purchases, as opposed to mortgage refinance. Origination volume relative to purchase activity improved and accounted for 91.7% originations for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to 88.5% of total originations for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Gross margins on loans sold decreased approximately 5% during the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016. About Waterstone Financial, Inc.Waterstone Financial, Inc.

The Investment Philosophy for Your Plan





Structured Income Plan: Our conversation will start at the bottom of the pyramid.  What is the single most important thing to have in retirement – a secure income.  After accounting for Social Security and pensions, the rest of that money needs to come from your savings.  We believe that investing for income requires a conservative approach and specific strategies.
Estate Growth and Protection: The next level of investing could involve products and strategies that are part of a plan to reduce taxes, protect your estate for your surviving spouse, or effectively leverage the impact you have on your beneficiaries.
Managed Investments: We are now ready to look at other investment opportunities, add risk back to the portfolio, and take advantage of options that allow you to participate in the markets.  The objective is to additional gains to fund an enhanced lifestyle and keep up with inflation.













Sequencing of Returns – the Biggest Risk in Retirement
Are your retirement savings at too much risk?  There are so many good aggressive strategies to use for investing while you are still accumulating assets and saving in your 401k or IRA’s.  But as this life savings gets closer to becoming your main source of income, too much risk can have a devastating impact.   Sequencing of Returns is one of the biggest reasons that retirees had to change their lifestyle, go back to work, or declare bankruptcy.  Contact us to do an evaluation of your current portfolio and see if you are at risk.

Life Insurance and Annuities
Insuring your plan can play a vital part in protecting your loved ones. Two very effective ways of doing this are by using Life Insurance and Annuities

Life Insurance is traditionally thought of as providing money for your survivors when you die. But it can also be a very flexible tool that could be part of almost any Financial Plan.

It can also provide tax-free income during your retirement
It can protect your business, your assets and estate
It can provide you with long term care insurance
It bypasses probate thus providing your family with an immediate source of cash after you are gone.


 
Annuities can play an important role in your Financial Plan, especially for your retirement. They can be used to give you a steady stream of income throughout your retirement. But caution needs to be taken when deciding which of the vast array of products available you should use.  Some will have unnecessary fees and there are subtle differences between contracts that can make a big difference to you.

It can pay an income for life, no matter how long you live – pension replacement
It can be used as a protected investment choice with returns similar to bonds
It can grow at significant interest rates for either future income or death benefit
It can be added to the plan to protect a survivors income after a spouse passes
