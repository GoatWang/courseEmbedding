EchoStar Corporation is a premier global provider of satellite communication solutions through its Hughes Network Systems and EchoStar Satellite Services business segments. It is the owner and operator of the satellite fleet for closely affiliated DISH.
Prior to the complete of a transaction with DISH on March 1, 2017, the company also designed and manufactured set-top boxes for DISH, Bell TV in Canada, and to receive the Freeview broadcasts in the United Kingdom. It also owned Sling Media, which designs and builds the Slingbox TV streaming device. Prior to 2008, it operated the Dish Network service brand, which was spun off as DISH on January 1, 2008.

History[edit]
EchoStar was originally formed in 1980 by its chairman Charles Ergen as a distributor of C band TV systems. In 1987, it applied for a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.
On December 28, 1995, the firm successfully launched its first satellite, EchoStar I. On March 4, 1996, it established the Dish Network brand name to market its home satellite TV system.
In 1998, EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of News Corporation's ASkyB and MCI Worldcom. With this purchase the firm obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° W orbital slot, more than doubling existing CONUS broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million. The acquisition inspired the company to introduce a multi-satellite system called DISH 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one dish.
"Legacy" represent the 950 to 1450 MHz frequencies used to deliver the signal throughout the home; the signal is broadcast to the home on the Ku band from satellite (12.2-12.7 GHz). Ku frequencies will not work on home wiring, the signal is downconverted to the intermediate frequency (IF) of 950-1450 MHz at the dish antenna. Newer technology (DishPro) also uses 1650-2150 MHz in addition to 950-1450.
Also in 1998, the firm, in association with Bell Canada, launched Bell TV. On September 25, 2007, the firm announced it had agreed to acquire Sling Media, Inc.
On January 2, 2008, the Dish Network business was demerged from the technology and infrastructure side of the business. A split in the shares created two companies, DISH Network Corporation which consists mainly of the DISH Network business, and EchoStar Corporation which retains ownership of the technology side including the satellites, Sling Media, and the set-top box development arm. DISH Network completed its distribution to Echostar of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of their satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the "Spin-off"). Since the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies. However, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, DISH Network owns shares of EchoStar and their subsidiary's preferred tracking stock representing an aggregate 80.0% economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of their Hughes segment. In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.
On February 14, 2011, EchoStar announced that it would acquire Hughes Communications in a deal valued at US$1.3 billion.[3]
TiVo patent lawsuit[edit]
Main article: TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp.
On June 3, 2009, satellite service provider EchoStar was found by Marshall, Texas, federal district court judge David Folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of TiVo's technology and was required to pay the DVR pioneer $103.1 million plus interest.
On May 3, 2011, Dish Network Corporation and EchoStar Corporation agreed to pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle a dispute over the use of some of TiVo’s technology.[4]

EchoStar Corporation is a premier global provider of satellite communication solutions through its Hughes Network Systems and EchoStar Satellite Services business segments. It is the owner and operator of the satellite fleet for closely affiliated DISH.
Prior to the complete of a transaction with DISH on March 1, 2017, the company also designed and manufactured set-top boxes for DISH, Bell TV in Canada, and to receive the Freeview broadcasts in the United Kingdom. It also owned Sling Media, which designs and builds the Slingbox TV streaming device. Prior to 2008, it operated the Dish Network service brand, which was spun off as DISH on January 1, 2008.

History[edit]
EchoStar was originally formed in 1980 by its chairman Charles Ergen as a distributor of C band TV systems. In 1987, it applied for a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.
On December 28, 1995, the firm successfully launched its first satellite, EchoStar I. On March 4, 1996, it established the Dish Network brand name to market its home satellite TV system.
In 1998, EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of News Corporation's ASkyB and MCI Worldcom. With this purchase the firm obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° W orbital slot, more than doubling existing CONUS broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million. The acquisition inspired the company to introduce a multi-satellite system called DISH 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one dish.
"Legacy" represent the 950 to 1450 MHz frequencies used to deliver the signal throughout the home; the signal is broadcast to the home on the Ku band from satellite (12.2-12.7 GHz). Ku frequencies will not work on home wiring, the signal is downconverted to the intermediate frequency (IF) of 950-1450 MHz at the dish antenna. Newer technology (DishPro) also uses 1650-2150 MHz in addition to 950-1450.
Also in 1998, the firm, in association with Bell Canada, launched Bell TV. On September 25, 2007, the firm announced it had agreed to acquire Sling Media, Inc.
On January 2, 2008, the Dish Network business was demerged from the technology and infrastructure side of the business. A split in the shares created two companies, DISH Network Corporation which consists mainly of the DISH Network business, and EchoStar Corporation which retains ownership of the technology side including the satellites, Sling Media, and the set-top box development arm. DISH Network completed its distribution to Echostar of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of their satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the "Spin-off"). Since the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies. However, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, DISH Network owns shares of EchoStar and their subsidiary's preferred tracking stock representing an aggregate 80.0% economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of their Hughes segment. In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.
On February 14, 2011, EchoStar announced that it would acquire Hughes Communications in a deal valued at US$1.3 billion.[3]
TiVo patent lawsuit[edit]
Main article: TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp.
On June 3, 2009, satellite service provider EchoStar was found by Marshall, Texas, federal district court judge David Folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of TiVo's technology and was required to pay the DVR pioneer $103.1 million plus interest.
On May 3, 2011, Dish Network Corporation and EchoStar Corporation agreed to pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle a dispute over the use of some of TiVo’s technology.[4]

Court
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit


Full case name

TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp. is a case stretching from 2004 to 2011, which took place in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. TiVo Inc. sued EchoStar Corp. claiming patent infringement of a DVR technology. The issues addressed during litigation included patent infringement, wording of injunctions, infringing product redesign, contempt of court orders, and contempt sanctions. Ultimately, the court held that EchoStar Corp. had indeed infringed TiVo Inc's patent and was in contempt of court for noncompliance of an injunction. The parties reached a settlement wherein EchoStar Corp. paid TiVo Inc. a licensing fee. Further, the court replaced the established contempt test with a single step test. The simplified test makes it more difficult for patent holders to prove contempt as a result of repeat infringement.

Overview[edit]
In 2004, TiVo Inc. sued the consortium of companies known as EchoStar Corp. (EchoStar Communications Corporation, EchoStar DBS Corporation, EchoStar Technologies Corporation, Echosphere Limited Liability Company, and EchoStar Satellite LLC, and Dish Network Corporation) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging they infringed various claims of the “Multimedia Time Warping System” patent (U.S. Patent 6,233,389 or ‘389 patent) with their line of competing digital video recorders (DVRs).
As described in U.S. Patent 6,233,389, TiVo claims a system for parsing real-time television metadata in an external ASIC. TiVo's system either uses the metadata embedded in an MPEG2 transport stream or generates similar metadata for analog broadcasts using the information provided by North American Broadcast Teletext Standard. The metadata is used to determine when specific events occur. Saving the event log makes it possible for the TiVo system to perform the following operations: "reverse, fast forward, play, pause, index, fast/slow reverse play, and fast/slow play."[1] One novel aspect of TiVo's '389 patent is the ASIC implementation. By dedicating a specialized processing unit to event detection, the application processor can be used for other tasks. TiVo's patent refers to their event coprocessor as the "MediaSwitch."
A jury found EchoStar Corp’s products infringed TiVo Inc’s patent, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction against EchoStar Corp.[2][3][4]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Upon review, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment of infringement due to the hardware claims; however, the court affirmed the judgment of infringement due to the software claims. The District Court's permanent injunction, stayed during the appeal proceeding, was placed back into effect.[2]
Soon after the appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in contempt of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [5] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original infringing product and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system in order to be compliant with the ruling. The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method."[6] The court determined that EchoStar Corp’s software redesign still infringed TiVo Inc. ‘389 patent; thus, EchoStar was held in contempt of the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.
Furthermore, the District Court held that EchoStar Corp never complied with the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction. Therefore, EchoStar Corp was held in contempt and sanctioned.[3][7]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment of contempt to the Federal Circuit. The court was unmoved by EchoStar Corp’s arguments and affirmed the District Court’s judgment with a 2–1 ruling, EchoStar then motioned for a rehearing en banc. Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit determined the KSM test was unworkable and instituted a new test for post-infringement contempt proceedings. The en banc Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the judgment on the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction. However, the judgment of contempt with respect to the violation of the Disablement Provision was affirmed. Thus, EchoStar was held to be in contempt of the permanent injunction with a 7–5 ruling.[3][8]
On April 29, 2011, the companies reached a $500 million settlement whereby EchoStar Corp. agreed to license DVR technology from TiVo Inc. In addition, all pending litigation was to be dismissed with prejudice and all injunctions dissolved. However, the en banc Federal Circuit appeal was not dismissed because a decision was reached before the settlement. Consequently, the parties were “free upon remand…to request that the District Court dismiss the complaint and vacate its previously imposed sanctions”[9] due to the settlement.

Opinion details[edit]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas[edit]
In a trial by jury, EchoStar was found to infringe TiVo Inc’s ‘389 patent. The infringing devices were the categorized by their video decoding ASIC. The two categories were DVRs using the 50X series ASIC and DVRs using Broadcom parts. The jury found, “the 50X DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware and software claims,”[2] the “Broadcom DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware claims and infringed the asserted software claims under the doctrine of equivalents.”[2] As a result, TiVo Inc. was awarded approximately $74 million in damages from lost profits and royalties, and a permanent injunction was issued against EchoStar.[2]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2006-1574 (Fed. Cir., January 31, 2008)[edit]
Before: Circuit Judge Bryson, Senior Circuit Judge Plager, and Chief District Judge Keeley
EchoStar Corp. motioned the Federal Circuit for an appeal and was granted a temporary stay on the permanent injunction. The issues on trial were two hardware claims (1 and 32) and two software claims (31 and 61) of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The Federal Circuit held “Broadcom DVRs do not satisfy the ‘is separated’ limitation [of the hardware claims] and the 50X DVRs don’t satisfy the ‘assembles’ limitation [of the hardware claims];”[2] thus, the appeals court reversed “the portion of the judgment upholding the jury’s verdict that EchoStar’s DVRs literally infringe the hardware claims.”[2] Finding the jury’s reasoning permissible, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury’s verdict that EchoStar Corp’s DVRs infringed the software claims of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The stay on the permanent injunction dissolved when the appeal became final and the District Court could determine if TiVo Inc. sustained additional damages while the stay was in effect.[2] Additional damages were found to be warranted.[11]
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., June 2, 2009)[edit]
TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp. in contempt for violating the Infringement and Disablement Provisions of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the KSM test to determine if a contempt proceeding was appropriate and if there was continuing infringement. The first step of the KSM test was to determine whether there was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products. The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.[7]
EchoStar argued that its redesign of the infringing products was more than colorably different by the KSM test.[3][7] Upon a comparison between the infringing and modified products, the District Court held “any differences between the infringing and modified products are no more than colorable … As a result, contempt proceeding in this case are appropriate [by the KSM test].”[7] Applying the second step of the KSM test, the District Court held “modifications do not affect elements of the disputed claims as construed … the infringing and modified devices may be treated as the same.”[7] Therefore, EchoStar Corp. continued to infringe TiVo Inc. patent ‘389 and was held in contempt of permanent injunction’s Infringement Provision.
With respect to the Disablement Provision, the District Court stated “even if EchoStar had achieved a non-infringing design-around, this Court would still find that EchoStar is in contempt of this Court’s permanent injunction … [regarding] the Disablement Provision of this Court’s order, which ordered EchoStar to ‘disable the DVR functionality.’” [7] EchoStar argued the Disablement Provision only covered original infringing products (non-software updated 50X and Broadcom DVRs). However, the District Court held that a plain reading of the order includes all 50X and Broadcom DVRs whether non-infringing redesigned or original infringing.[3][7] The District Court ordered EchoStar Corps. to deactivate the DVR capability of all 50X and Broadcom DVRs regardless of the software utilized by the device; EchoStar Corps. did not comply and were held in contempt of the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction.
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., September 4, 2009)[edit]
This ruling determined the sanctions against EchoStar Corp. for violation the permanent injunction. The District Court awarded TiVo Inc. “$2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the contempt period,”[11] which amounts to nearly $90 million in addition to the original jury award.[3] Furthermore, EchoStar Corp. must reimburse TiVo Inc’s legal fees for the contempt proceedings.[11] The District Court amended its earlier injunction to require “EchoStar seek the court’s approval before implementing future non-infringing workarounds to its DVR software.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir., March 4, 2010)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Mayer and Lourie)
EchoStar Crop. appealed the District Court’s contempt ruling on the grounds that issues relating to continued infringement are impermissible in a contempt proceeding due to changes made during the redesign. The Federal Circuit disagreed and held that the District Court “used the proper standard in its analysis,”[3] the KSM test. The Federal Circuit concluded there was no “abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to hold contempt proceedings,”[3] In addition, the Federal Circuit was persuaded that the District Court could find EchoStar in contempt of the Infringement Provision and that there was “clear and convincing evidence"[3][12] to do so. With regards to the Disablement Provision, the Federal Circuit held a plain reading “would have provided EchoStar with notice of what is now being held in contempt;”[3] furthermore, the chance to appeal the provision language has passed. The amendment to the permanent injunction which required EchoStar Crop. to seek pre-approval for any new design-around effort was affirmed.[3][12]
Dissenting Opinion (Circuit Judge Rader)

“Indeed, the only thing that is not different [about this case] is the identity of the parties themselves. These differences deserve a trial, not a summary contempt proceeding.” ~Circuit Judge Rader[3]

Judge Rader argued the District Court’s injunction was too broad and ambiguously worded.[12] Furthermore, the dissenting opinion argued “TiVo should not be able to bootstrap its new, previously abandoned infringement theory to that [previous] verdict,”[3] because this “discourages good faith efforts to design around an infringement verdict.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir. April 20, 2011) (en banc)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Lourie, Newman, Mayer, Bryson, Moore, O’Malley, and Reyna; In Part Chief Circuit Judge Rader, Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, Dyk, and Prost)
EchoStar Corp. petitioned for a rehearing en banc by the Federal Circuit to challenge “the enforceability of the District Court's injunction based on overbreadth and vagueness.”[4] Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit overruled the case which the KSM test was from, “we conclude that KSM's two-step inquiry has been unworkable and now overrule that holding of KSM.”[4] The en banc Federal Circuit replaced the KSM test with a straight “more than colorable difference test.”[8] As a result of the application of the new test, the en banc Federal Circuit vacated the District Court’s finding of contempt for violating the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.[4] However, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holding with regards to the Disablement Provision; thus, affirming the District Court’s finding of contempt.[4][8] The en banc Federal Circuit found EchoStar Corp’s arguments for overbreath and vagueness in the permanent injunction “unpersuasive.”[4]
The original jury award was vacated; however, the contempt sanctions were affirmed.[4][9] In addition, the District Court’s holding of infringement provision contempt was remanded “to make a finding concerning any colorable difference between the previously adjudicated infringing devices and the newly accused devices”[4] using the new test laid out in this case.
Dissenting Opinion (Chief Circuit Judge Rader; and Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, and Prost)
The dissenting opinion focused on the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction, which argued that the finding of contempt should have been reversed outright.[4][8] “In my view, the disablement provision does not bar the installation of modified software that renders the devices non-infringing, and, even if the provision were unclear, an unclear injunction cannot be the basis for contempt.”[4] In addition, the dissenting opinion argued this case should not be remanded to the lower court due to the Infringement Provision since “that provision plainly was not violated.”[4]
Precedent established[edit]

“The ruling seems to make it easier to initiate contempt proceedings but harder to prove contempt [for continued infringement].” ~Carlos Perez-Albuerne, partner at Choate Hall & Stewart[13]

As a result of the en banc ruling of the Federal Circuit, a new test to determine whether an adjudged infringer can be held in contempt for continued infringement was implemented.[13] This new test replaced the old two-step KSM test from the 1985 decision in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc.[4] The new test “raised the bar for proving that defendant committed contempt” by requiring that a patentee show “the elements found infringing in the original product without significant change in the redesign.”[13] The KSM test required that the original and redesign were “generally similar.”[13] In addition, the patentee must “show that the defendant’s redesigned product infringes upon the same patent claims as the original product.”[13]

TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp. is a case stretching from 2004 to 2011, which took place in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. TiVo Inc. sued EchoStar Corp. claiming patent infringement of a DVR technology. The issues addressed during litigation included patent infringement, wording of injunctions, infringing product redesign, contempt of court orders, and contempt sanctions. Ultimately, the court held that EchoStar Corp. had indeed infringed TiVo Inc's patent and was in contempt of court for noncompliance of an injunction. The parties reached a settlement wherein EchoStar Corp. paid TiVo Inc. a licensing fee. Further, the court replaced the established contempt test with a single step test. The simplified test makes it more difficult for patent holders to prove contempt as a result of repeat infringement.

Overview[edit]
In 2004, TiVo Inc. sued the consortium of companies known as EchoStar Corp. (EchoStar Communications Corporation, EchoStar DBS Corporation, EchoStar Technologies Corporation, Echosphere Limited Liability Company, and EchoStar Satellite LLC, and Dish Network Corporation) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging they infringed various claims of the “Multimedia Time Warping System” patent (U.S. Patent 6,233,389 or ‘389 patent) with their line of competing digital video recorders (DVRs).
As described in U.S. Patent 6,233,389, TiVo claims a system for parsing real-time television metadata in an external ASIC. TiVo's system either uses the metadata embedded in an MPEG2 transport stream or generates similar metadata for analog broadcasts using the information provided by North American Broadcast Teletext Standard. The metadata is used to determine when specific events occur. Saving the event log makes it possible for the TiVo system to perform the following operations: "reverse, fast forward, play, pause, index, fast/slow reverse play, and fast/slow play."[1] One novel aspect of TiVo's '389 patent is the ASIC implementation. By dedicating a specialized processing unit to event detection, the application processor can be used for other tasks. TiVo's patent refers to their event coprocessor as the "MediaSwitch."
A jury found EchoStar Corp’s products infringed TiVo Inc’s patent, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction against EchoStar Corp.[2][3][4]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Upon review, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment of infringement due to the hardware claims; however, the court affirmed the judgment of infringement due to the software claims. The District Court's permanent injunction, stayed during the appeal proceeding, was placed back into effect.[2]
Soon after the appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in contempt of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [5] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original infringing product and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system in order to be compliant with the ruling. The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method."[6] The court determined that EchoStar Corp’s software redesign still infringed TiVo Inc. ‘389 patent; thus, EchoStar was held in contempt of the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.
Furthermore, the District Court held that EchoStar Corp never complied with the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction. Therefore, EchoStar Corp was held in contempt and sanctioned.[3][7]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment of contempt to the Federal Circuit. The court was unmoved by EchoStar Corp’s arguments and affirmed the District Court’s judgment with a 2–1 ruling, EchoStar then motioned for a rehearing en banc. Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit determined the KSM test was unworkable and instituted a new test for post-infringement contempt proceedings. The en banc Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the judgment on the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction. However, the judgment of contempt with respect to the violation of the Disablement Provision was affirmed. Thus, EchoStar was held to be in contempt of the permanent injunction with a 7–5 ruling.[3][8]
On April 29, 2011, the companies reached a $500 million settlement whereby EchoStar Corp. agreed to license DVR technology from TiVo Inc. In addition, all pending litigation was to be dismissed with prejudice and all injunctions dissolved. However, the en banc Federal Circuit appeal was not dismissed because a decision was reached before the settlement. Consequently, the parties were “free upon remand…to request that the District Court dismiss the complaint and vacate its previously imposed sanctions”[9] due to the settlement.

Opinion details[edit]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas[edit]
In a trial by jury, EchoStar was found to infringe TiVo Inc’s ‘389 patent. The infringing devices were the categorized by their video decoding ASIC. The two categories were DVRs using the 50X series ASIC and DVRs using Broadcom parts. The jury found, “the 50X DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware and software claims,”[2] the “Broadcom DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware claims and infringed the asserted software claims under the doctrine of equivalents.”[2] As a result, TiVo Inc. was awarded approximately $74 million in damages from lost profits and royalties, and a permanent injunction was issued against EchoStar.[2]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2006-1574 (Fed. Cir., January 31, 2008)[edit]
Before: Circuit Judge Bryson, Senior Circuit Judge Plager, and Chief District Judge Keeley
EchoStar Corp. motioned the Federal Circuit for an appeal and was granted a temporary stay on the permanent injunction. The issues on trial were two hardware claims (1 and 32) and two software claims (31 and 61) of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The Federal Circuit held “Broadcom DVRs do not satisfy the ‘is separated’ limitation [of the hardware claims] and the 50X DVRs don’t satisfy the ‘assembles’ limitation [of the hardware claims];”[2] thus, the appeals court reversed “the portion of the judgment upholding the jury’s verdict that EchoStar’s DVRs literally infringe the hardware claims.”[2] Finding the jury’s reasoning permissible, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury’s verdict that EchoStar Corp’s DVRs infringed the software claims of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The stay on the permanent injunction dissolved when the appeal became final and the District Court could determine if TiVo Inc. sustained additional damages while the stay was in effect.[2] Additional damages were found to be warranted.[11]
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., June 2, 2009)[edit]
TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp. in contempt for violating the Infringement and Disablement Provisions of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the KSM test to determine if a contempt proceeding was appropriate and if there was continuing infringement. The first step of the KSM test was to determine whether there was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products. The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.[7]
EchoStar argued that its redesign of the infringing products was more than colorably different by the KSM test.[3][7] Upon a comparison between the infringing and modified products, the District Court held “any differences between the infringing and modified products are no more than colorable … As a result, contempt proceeding in this case are appropriate [by the KSM test].”[7] Applying the second step of the KSM test, the District Court held “modifications do not affect elements of the disputed claims as construed … the infringing and modified devices may be treated as the same.”[7] Therefore, EchoStar Corp. continued to infringe TiVo Inc. patent ‘389 and was held in contempt of permanent injunction’s Infringement Provision.
With respect to the Disablement Provision, the District Court stated “even if EchoStar had achieved a non-infringing design-around, this Court would still find that EchoStar is in contempt of this Court’s permanent injunction … [regarding] the Disablement Provision of this Court’s order, which ordered EchoStar to ‘disable the DVR functionality.’” [7] EchoStar argued the Disablement Provision only covered original infringing products (non-software updated 50X and Broadcom DVRs). However, the District Court held that a plain reading of the order includes all 50X and Broadcom DVRs whether non-infringing redesigned or original infringing.[3][7] The District Court ordered EchoStar Corps. to deactivate the DVR capability of all 50X and Broadcom DVRs regardless of the software utilized by the device; EchoStar Corps. did not comply and were held in contempt of the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction.
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., September 4, 2009)[edit]
This ruling determined the sanctions against EchoStar Corp. for violation the permanent injunction. The District Court awarded TiVo Inc. “$2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the contempt period,”[11] which amounts to nearly $90 million in addition to the original jury award.[3] Furthermore, EchoStar Corp. must reimburse TiVo Inc’s legal fees for the contempt proceedings.[11] The District Court amended its earlier injunction to require “EchoStar seek the court’s approval before implementing future non-infringing workarounds to its DVR software.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir., March 4, 2010)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Mayer and Lourie)
EchoStar Crop. appealed the District Court’s contempt ruling on the grounds that issues relating to continued infringement are impermissible in a contempt proceeding due to changes made during the redesign. The Federal Circuit disagreed and held that the District Court “used the proper standard in its analysis,”[3] the KSM test. The Federal Circuit concluded there was no “abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to hold contempt proceedings,”[3] In addition, the Federal Circuit was persuaded that the District Court could find EchoStar in contempt of the Infringement Provision and that there was “clear and convincing evidence"[3][12] to do so. With regards to the Disablement Provision, the Federal Circuit held a plain reading “would have provided EchoStar with notice of what is now being held in contempt;”[3] furthermore, the chance to appeal the provision language has passed. The amendment to the permanent injunction which required EchoStar Crop. to seek pre-approval for any new design-around effort was affirmed.[3][12]
Dissenting Opinion (Circuit Judge Rader)

“Indeed, the only thing that is not different [about this case] is the identity of the parties themselves. These differences deserve a trial, not a summary contempt proceeding.” ~Circuit Judge Rader[3]

Judge Rader argued the District Court’s injunction was too broad and ambiguously worded.[12] Furthermore, the dissenting opinion argued “TiVo should not be able to bootstrap its new, previously abandoned infringement theory to that [previous] verdict,”[3] because this “discourages good faith efforts to design around an infringement verdict.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir. April 20, 2011) (en banc)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Lourie, Newman, Mayer, Bryson, Moore, O’Malley, and Reyna; In Part Chief Circuit Judge Rader, Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, Dyk, and Prost)
EchoStar Corp. petitioned for a rehearing en banc by the Federal Circuit to challenge “the enforceability of the District Court's injunction based on overbreadth and vagueness.”[4] Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit overruled the case which the KSM test was from, “we conclude that KSM's two-step inquiry has been unworkable and now overrule that holding of KSM.”[4] The en banc Federal Circuit replaced the KSM test with a straight “more than colorable difference test.”[8] As a result of the application of the new test, the en banc Federal Circuit vacated the District Court’s finding of contempt for violating the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.[4] However, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holding with regards to the Disablement Provision; thus, affirming the District Court’s finding of contempt.[4][8] The en banc Federal Circuit found EchoStar Corp’s arguments for overbreath and vagueness in the permanent injunction “unpersuasive.”[4]
The original jury award was vacated; however, the contempt sanctions were affirmed.[4][9] In addition, the District Court’s holding of infringement provision contempt was remanded “to make a finding concerning any colorable difference between the previously adjudicated infringing devices and the newly accused devices”[4] using the new test laid out in this case.
Dissenting Opinion (Chief Circuit Judge Rader; and Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, and Prost)
The dissenting opinion focused on the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction, which argued that the finding of contempt should have been reversed outright.[4][8] “In my view, the disablement provision does not bar the installation of modified software that renders the devices non-infringing, and, even if the provision were unclear, an unclear injunction cannot be the basis for contempt.”[4] In addition, the dissenting opinion argued this case should not be remanded to the lower court due to the Infringement Provision since “that provision plainly was not violated.”[4]
Precedent established[edit]

“The ruling seems to make it easier to initiate contempt proceedings but harder to prove contempt [for continued infringement].” ~Carlos Perez-Albuerne, partner at Choate Hall & Stewart[13]

As a result of the en banc ruling of the Federal Circuit, a new test to determine whether an adjudged infringer can be held in contempt for continued infringement was implemented.[13] This new test replaced the old two-step KSM test from the 1985 decision in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc.[4] The new test “raised the bar for proving that defendant committed contempt” by requiring that a patentee show “the elements found infringing in the original product without significant change in the redesign.”[13] The KSM test required that the original and redesign were “generally similar.”[13] In addition, the patentee must “show that the defendant’s redesigned product infringes upon the same patent claims as the original product.”[13]

TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., June 2, 2009)[edit]
TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp. in contempt for violating the Infringement and Disablement Provisions of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the KSM test to determine if a contempt proceeding was appropriate and if there was continuing infringement. The first step of the KSM test was to determine whether there was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products. The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.[7]
EchoStar argued that its redesign of the infringing products was more than colorably different by the KSM test.[3][7] Upon a comparison between the infringing and modified products, the District Court held “any differences between the infringing and modified products are no more than colorable … As a result, contempt proceeding in this case are appropriate [by the KSM test].”[7] Applying the second step of the KSM test, the District Court held “modifications do not affect elements of the disputed claims as construed … the infringing and modified devices may be treated as the same.”[7] Therefore, EchoStar Corp. continued to infringe TiVo Inc. patent ‘389 and was held in contempt of permanent injunction’s Infringement Provision.
With respect to the Disablement Provision, the District Court stated “even if EchoStar had achieved a non-infringing design-around, this Court would still find that EchoStar is in contempt of this Court’s permanent injunction … [regarding] the Disablement Provision of this Court’s order, which ordered EchoStar to ‘disable the DVR functionality.’” [7] EchoStar argued the Disablement Provision only covered original infringing products (non-software updated 50X and Broadcom DVRs). However, the District Court held that a plain reading of the order includes all 50X and Broadcom DVRs whether non-infringing redesigned or original infringing.[3][7] The District Court ordered EchoStar Corps. to deactivate the DVR capability of all 50X and Broadcom DVRs regardless of the software utilized by the device; EchoStar Corps. did not comply and were held in contempt of the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction.
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., September 4, 2009)[edit]
This ruling determined the sanctions against EchoStar Corp. for violation the permanent injunction. The District Court awarded TiVo Inc. “$2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the contempt period,”[11] which amounts to nearly $90 million in addition to the original jury award.[3] Furthermore, EchoStar Corp. must reimburse TiVo Inc’s legal fees for the contempt proceedings.[11] The District Court amended its earlier injunction to require “EchoStar seek the court’s approval before implementing future non-infringing workarounds to its DVR software.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir., March 4, 2010)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Mayer and Lourie)
EchoStar Crop. appealed the District Court’s contempt ruling on the grounds that issues relating to continued infringement are impermissible in a contempt proceeding due to changes made during the redesign. The Federal Circuit disagreed and held that the District Court “used the proper standard in its analysis,”[3] the KSM test. The Federal Circuit concluded there was no “abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to hold contempt proceedings,”[3] In addition, the Federal Circuit was persuaded that the District Court could find EchoStar in contempt of the Infringement Provision and that there was “clear and convincing evidence"[3][12] to do so. With regards to the Disablement Provision, the Federal Circuit held a plain reading “would have provided EchoStar with notice of what is now being held in contempt;”[3] furthermore, the chance to appeal the provision language has passed. The amendment to the permanent injunction which required EchoStar Crop. to seek pre-approval for any new design-around effort was affirmed.[3][12]
Dissenting Opinion (Circuit Judge Rader)

“Indeed, the only thing that is not different [about this case] is the identity of the parties themselves. These differences deserve a trial, not a summary contempt proceeding.” ~Circuit Judge Rader[3]

Judge Rader argued the District Court’s injunction was too broad and ambiguously worded.[12] Furthermore, the dissenting opinion argued “TiVo should not be able to bootstrap its new, previously abandoned infringement theory to that [previous] verdict,”[3] because this “discourages good faith efforts to design around an infringement verdict.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir. April 20, 2011) (en banc)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Lourie, Newman, Mayer, Bryson, Moore, O’Malley, and Reyna; In Part Chief Circuit Judge Rader, Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, Dyk, and Prost)
EchoStar Corp. petitioned for a rehearing en banc by the Federal Circuit to challenge “the enforceability of the District Court's injunction based on overbreadth and vagueness.”[4] Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit overruled the case which the KSM test was from, “we conclude that KSM's two-step inquiry has been unworkable and now overrule that holding of KSM.”[4] The en banc Federal Circuit replaced the KSM test with a straight “more than colorable difference test.”[8] As a result of the application of the new test, the en banc Federal Circuit vacated the District Court’s finding of contempt for violating the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.[4] However, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holding with regards to the Disablement Provision; thus, affirming the District Court’s finding of contempt.[4][8] The en banc Federal Circuit found EchoStar Corp’s arguments for overbreath and vagueness in the permanent injunction “unpersuasive.”[4]
The original jury award was vacated; however, the contempt sanctions were affirmed.[4][9] In addition, the District Court’s holding of infringement provision contempt was remanded “to make a finding concerning any colorable difference between the previously adjudicated infringing devices and the newly accused devices”[4] using the new test laid out in this case.
Dissenting Opinion (Chief Circuit Judge Rader; and Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, and Prost)
The dissenting opinion focused on the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction, which argued that the finding of contempt should have been reversed outright.[4][8] “In my view, the disablement provision does not bar the installation of modified software that renders the devices non-infringing, and, even if the provision were unclear, an unclear injunction cannot be the basis for contempt.”[4] In addition, the dissenting opinion argued this case should not be remanded to the lower court due to the Infringement Provision since “that provision plainly was not violated.”[4]
Precedent established[edit]

“The ruling seems to make it easier to initiate contempt proceedings but harder to prove contempt [for continued infringement].” ~Carlos Perez-Albuerne, partner at Choate Hall & Stewart[13]

As a result of the en banc ruling of the Federal Circuit, a new test to determine whether an adjudged infringer can be held in contempt for continued infringement was implemented.[13] This new test replaced the old two-step KSM test from the 1985 decision in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc.[4] The new test “raised the bar for proving that defendant committed contempt” by requiring that a patentee show “the elements found infringing in the original product without significant change in the redesign.”[13] The KSM test required that the original and redesign were “generally similar.”[13] In addition, the patentee must “show that the defendant’s redesigned product infringes upon the same patent claims as the original product.”[13]

TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp





Court
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit


Full case name
TIVO INC., Plaintiff-Appellee, v. ECHOSTAR CORPORATION, EchoStar Dbs Corporation, EchoStar Technologies Corporation, EchoSphere Limited Liability Company, EchoStar Satellite LLC, and Dish Network Corporation, Defendants-Appellants.


Decided
April 20, 2011

TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp. is a case stretching from 2004 to 2011, which took place in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. TiVo Inc. sued EchoStar Corp. claiming patent infringement of a DVR technology. The issues addressed during litigation included patent infringement, wording of injunctions, infringing product redesign, contempt of court orders, and contempt sanctions. Ultimately, the court held that EchoStar Corp. had indeed infringed TiVo Inc's patent and was in contempt of court for noncompliance of an injunction. The parties reached a settlement wherein EchoStar Corp. paid TiVo Inc. a licensing fee. Further, the court replaced the established contempt test with a single step test. The simplified test makes it more difficult for patent holders to prove contempt as a result of repeat infringement.

Overview[edit]
In 2004, TiVo Inc. sued the consortium of companies known as EchoStar Corp. (EchoStar Communications Corporation, EchoStar DBS Corporation, EchoStar Technologies Corporation, Echosphere Limited Liability Company, and EchoStar Satellite LLC, and Dish Network Corporation) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging they infringed various claims of the “Multimedia Time Warping System” patent (U.S. Patent 6,233,389 or ‘389 patent) with their line of competing digital video recorders (DVRs).
As described in U.S. Patent 6,233,389, TiVo claims a system for parsing real-time television metadata in an external ASIC. TiVo's system either uses the metadata embedded in an MPEG2 transport stream or generates similar metadata for analog broadcasts using the information provided by North American Broadcast Teletext Standard. The metadata is used to determine when specific events occur. Saving the event log makes it possible for the TiVo system to perform the following operations: "reverse, fast forward, play, pause, index, fast/slow reverse play, and fast/slow play."[1] One novel aspect of TiVo's '389 patent is the ASIC implementation. By dedicating a specialized processing unit to event detection, the application processor can be used for other tasks. TiVo's patent refers to their event coprocessor as the "MediaSwitch."
A jury found EchoStar Corp’s products infringed TiVo Inc’s patent, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction against EchoStar Corp.[2][3][4]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Upon review, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment of infringement due to the hardware claims; however, the court affirmed the judgment of infringement due to the software claims. The District Court's permanent injunction, stayed during the appeal proceeding, was placed back into effect.[2]
Soon after the appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in contempt of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [5] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original infringing product and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system in order to be compliant with the ruling. The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method."[6] The court determined that EchoStar Corp’s software redesign still infringed TiVo Inc. ‘389 patent; thus, EchoStar was held in contempt of the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.
Furthermore, the District Court held that EchoStar Corp never complied with the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction. Therefore, EchoStar Corp was held in contempt and sanctioned.[3][7]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment of contempt to the Federal Circuit. The court was unmoved by EchoStar Corp’s arguments and affirmed the District Court’s judgment with a 2–1 ruling, EchoStar then motioned for a rehearing en banc. Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit determined the KSM test was unworkable and instituted a new test for post-infringement contempt proceedings. The en banc Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the judgment on the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction. However, the judgment of contempt with respect to the violation of the Disablement Provision was affirmed. Thus, EchoStar was held to be in contempt of the permanent injunction with a 7–5 ruling.[3][8]
On April 29, 2011, the companies reached a $500 million settlement whereby EchoStar Corp. agreed to license DVR technology from TiVo Inc. In addition, all pending litigation was to be dismissed with prejudice and all injunctions dissolved. However, the en banc Federal Circuit appeal was not dismissed because a decision was reached before the settlement. Consequently, the parties were “free upon remand…to request that the District Court dismiss the complaint and vacate its previously imposed sanctions”[9] due to the settlement.

Opinion details[edit]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas[edit]
In a trial by jury, EchoStar was found to infringe TiVo Inc’s ‘389 patent. The infringing devices were the categorized by their video decoding ASIC. The two categories were DVRs using the 50X series ASIC and DVRs using Broadcom parts. The jury found, “the 50X DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware and software claims,”[2] the “Broadcom DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware claims and infringed the asserted software claims under the doctrine of equivalents.”[2] As a result, TiVo Inc. was awarded approximately $74 million in damages from lost profits and royalties, and a permanent injunction was issued against EchoStar.[2]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2006-1574 (Fed. Cir., January 31, 2008)[edit]
Before: Circuit Judge Bryson, Senior Circuit Judge Plager, and Chief District Judge Keeley
EchoStar Corp. motioned the Federal Circuit for an appeal and was granted a temporary stay on the permanent injunction. The issues on trial were two hardware claims (1 and 32) and two software claims (31 and 61) of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The Federal Circuit held “Broadcom DVRs do not satisfy the ‘is separated’ limitation [of the hardware claims] and the 50X DVRs don’t satisfy the ‘assembles’ limitation [of the hardware claims];”[2] thus, the appeals court reversed “the portion of the judgment upholding the jury’s verdict that EchoStar’s DVRs literally infringe the hardware claims.”[2] Finding the jury’s reasoning permissible, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury’s verdict that EchoStar Corp’s DVRs infringed the software claims of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The stay on the permanent injunction dissolved when the appeal became final and the District Court could determine if TiVo Inc. sustained additional damages while the stay was in effect.[2] Additional damages were found to be warranted.[11]
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., June 2, 2009)[edit]
TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp. in contempt for violating the Infringement and Disablement Provisions of the permanent injunction.

The first step of the KSM test was to determine whether there was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products.

History[edit]
EchoStar was originally formed in 1980 by its chairman Charles Ergen as a distributor of C band TV systems. In 1987, it applied for a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.
On December 28, 1995, the firm successfully launched its first satellite, EchoStar I. On March 4, 1996, it established the Dish Network brand name to market its home satellite TV system.
In 1998, EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of News Corporation's ASkyB and MCI Worldcom. With this purchase the firm obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° W orbital slot, more than doubling existing CONUS broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million. The acquisition inspired the company to introduce a multi-satellite system called DISH 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one dish.
"Legacy" represent the 950 to 1450 MHz frequencies used to deliver the signal throughout the home; the signal is broadcast to the home on the Ku band from satellite (12.2-12.7 GHz). Ku frequencies will not work on home wiring, the signal is downconverted to the intermediate frequency (IF) of 950-1450 MHz at the dish antenna. Newer technology (DishPro) also uses 1650-2150 MHz in addition to 950-1450.
Also in 1998, the firm, in association with Bell Canada, launched Bell TV. On September 25, 2007, the firm announced it had agreed to acquire Sling Media, Inc.
On January 2, 2008, the Dish Network business was demerged from the technology and infrastructure side of the business. A split in the shares created two companies, DISH Network Corporation which consists mainly of the DISH Network business, and EchoStar Corporation which retains ownership of the technology side including the satellites, Sling Media, and the set-top box development arm. DISH Network completed its distribution to Echostar of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of their satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the "Spin-off"). Since the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies. However, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, DISH Network owns shares of EchoStar and their subsidiary's preferred tracking stock representing an aggregate 80.0% economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of their Hughes segment. In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.
On February 14, 2011, EchoStar announced that it would acquire Hughes Communications in a deal valued at US$1.3 billion.[3]
TiVo patent lawsuit[edit]
Main article: TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp.
On June 3, 2009, satellite service provider EchoStar was found by Marshall, Texas, federal district court judge David Folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of TiVo's technology and was required to pay the DVR pioneer $103.1 million plus interest.
On May 3, 2011, Dish Network Corporation and EchoStar Corporation agreed to pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle a dispute over the use of some of TiVo’s technology.[4]

TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp





Court
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit


Full case name
TIVO INC., Plaintiff-Appellee, v. ECHOSTAR CORPORATION, EchoStar Dbs Corporation, EchoStar Technologies Corporation, EchoSphere Limited Liability Company, EchoStar Satellite LLC, and Dish Network Corporation, Defendants-Appellants.

TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp. is a case stretching from 2004 to 2011, which took place in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. TiVo Inc. sued EchoStar Corp. claiming patent infringement of a DVR technology. The issues addressed during litigation included patent infringement, wording of injunctions, infringing product redesign, contempt of court orders, and contempt sanctions. Ultimately, the court held that EchoStar Corp. had indeed infringed TiVo Inc's patent and was in contempt of court for noncompliance of an injunction. The parties reached a settlement wherein EchoStar Corp. paid TiVo Inc. a licensing fee. Further, the court replaced the established contempt test with a single step test. The simplified test makes it more difficult for patent holders to prove contempt as a result of repeat infringement.

Overview[edit]
In 2004, TiVo Inc. sued the consortium of companies known as EchoStar Corp. (EchoStar Communications Corporation, EchoStar DBS Corporation, EchoStar Technologies Corporation, Echosphere Limited Liability Company, and EchoStar Satellite LLC, and Dish Network Corporation) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging they infringed various claims of the “Multimedia Time Warping System” patent (U.S. Patent 6,233,389 or ‘389 patent) with their line of competing digital video recorders (DVRs).
As described in U.S. Patent 6,233,389, TiVo claims a system for parsing real-time television metadata in an external ASIC. TiVo's system either uses the metadata embedded in an MPEG2 transport stream or generates similar metadata for analog broadcasts using the information provided by North American Broadcast Teletext Standard. The metadata is used to determine when specific events occur. Saving the event log makes it possible for the TiVo system to perform the following operations: "reverse, fast forward, play, pause, index, fast/slow reverse play, and fast/slow play."[1] One novel aspect of TiVo's '389 patent is the ASIC implementation. By dedicating a specialized processing unit to event detection, the application processor can be used for other tasks. TiVo's patent refers to their event coprocessor as the "MediaSwitch."
A jury found EchoStar Corp’s products infringed TiVo Inc’s patent, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction against EchoStar Corp.[2][3][4]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Upon review, the Federal Circuit reversed the judgment of infringement due to the hardware claims; however, the court affirmed the judgment of infringement due to the software claims. The District Court's permanent injunction, stayed during the appeal proceeding, was placed back into effect.[2]
Soon after the appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in contempt of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [5] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original infringing product and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system in order to be compliant with the ruling. The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method."[6] The court determined that EchoStar Corp’s software redesign still infringed TiVo Inc. ‘389 patent; thus, EchoStar was held in contempt of the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.
Furthermore, the District Court held that EchoStar Corp never complied with the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction. Therefore, EchoStar Corp was held in contempt and sanctioned.[3][7]
EchoStar Corp. appealed the judgment of contempt to the Federal Circuit. The court was unmoved by EchoStar Corp’s arguments and affirmed the District Court’s judgment with a 2–1 ruling, EchoStar then motioned for a rehearing en banc. Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit determined the KSM test was unworkable and instituted a new test for post-infringement contempt proceedings. The en banc Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the judgment on the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction. However, the judgment of contempt with respect to the violation of the Disablement Provision was affirmed. Thus, EchoStar was held to be in contempt of the permanent injunction with a 7–5 ruling.[3][8]
On April 29, 2011, the companies reached a $500 million settlement whereby EchoStar Corp. agreed to license DVR technology from TiVo Inc. In addition, all pending litigation was to be dismissed with prejudice and all injunctions dissolved. However, the en banc Federal Circuit appeal was not dismissed because a decision was reached before the settlement. Consequently, the parties were “free upon remand…to request that the District Court dismiss the complaint and vacate its previously imposed sanctions”[9] due to the settlement.

Opinion details[edit]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas[edit]
In a trial by jury, EchoStar was found to infringe TiVo Inc’s ‘389 patent. The infringing devices were the categorized by their video decoding ASIC. The two categories were DVRs using the 50X series ASIC and DVRs using Broadcom parts. The jury found, “the 50X DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware and software claims,”[2] the “Broadcom DVRs literally infringed the asserted hardware claims and infringed the asserted software claims under the doctrine of equivalents.”[2] As a result, TiVo Inc. was awarded approximately $74 million in damages from lost profits and royalties, and a permanent injunction was issued against EchoStar.[2]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2006-1574 (Fed. Cir., January 31, 2008)[edit]
Before: Circuit Judge Bryson, Senior Circuit Judge Plager, and Chief District Judge Keeley
EchoStar Corp. motioned the Federal Circuit for an appeal and was granted a temporary stay on the permanent injunction. The issues on trial were two hardware claims (1 and 32) and two software claims (31 and 61) of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The Federal Circuit held “Broadcom DVRs do not satisfy the ‘is separated’ limitation [of the hardware claims] and the 50X DVRs don’t satisfy the ‘assembles’ limitation [of the hardware claims];”[2] thus, the appeals court reversed “the portion of the judgment upholding the jury’s verdict that EchoStar’s DVRs literally infringe the hardware claims.”[2] Finding the jury’s reasoning permissible, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury’s verdict that EchoStar Corp’s DVRs infringed the software claims of TiVo Inc.’s ‘389 patent. The stay on the permanent injunction dissolved when the appeal became final and the District Court could determine if TiVo Inc. sustained additional damages while the stay was in effect.[2] Additional damages were found to be warranted.[11]
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., June 2, 2009)[edit]
TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp. in contempt for violating the Infringement and Disablement Provisions of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the KSM test to determine if a contempt proceeding was appropriate and if there was continuing infringement. The first step of the KSM test was to determine whether there was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products. The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.[7]
EchoStar argued that its redesign of the infringing products was more than colorably different by the KSM test.[3][7] Upon a comparison between the infringing and modified products, the District Court held “any differences between the infringing and modified products are no more than colorable … As a result, contempt proceeding in this case are appropriate [by the KSM test].”[7] Applying the second step of the KSM test, the District Court held “modifications do not affect elements of the disputed claims as construed … the infringing and modified devices may be treated as the same.”[7] Therefore, EchoStar Corp. continued to infringe TiVo Inc. patent ‘389 and was held in contempt of permanent injunction’s Infringement Provision.
With respect to the Disablement Provision, the District Court stated “even if EchoStar had achieved a non-infringing design-around, this Court would still find that EchoStar is in contempt of this Court’s permanent injunction … [regarding] the Disablement Provision of this Court’s order, which ordered EchoStar to ‘disable the DVR functionality.’” [7] EchoStar argued the Disablement Provision only covered original infringing products (non-software updated 50X and Broadcom DVRs). However, the District Court held that a plain reading of the order includes all 50X and Broadcom DVRs whether non-infringing redesigned or original infringing.[3][7] The District Court ordered EchoStar Corps. to deactivate the DVR capability of all 50X and Broadcom DVRs regardless of the software utilized by the device; EchoStar Corps. did not comply and were held in contempt of the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction.
TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., Civil Action No. 2:04-CV-01 (E.D. Tex., September 4, 2009)[edit]
This ruling determined the sanctions against EchoStar Corp. for violation the permanent injunction. The District Court awarded TiVo Inc. “$2.25 per DVR subscriber per month for the contempt period,”[11] which amounts to nearly $90 million in addition to the original jury award.[3] Furthermore, EchoStar Corp. must reimburse TiVo Inc’s legal fees for the contempt proceedings.[11] The District Court amended its earlier injunction to require “EchoStar seek the court’s approval before implementing future non-infringing workarounds to its DVR software.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir., March 4, 2010)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Mayer and Lourie)
EchoStar Crop. appealed the District Court’s contempt ruling on the grounds that issues relating to continued infringement are impermissible in a contempt proceeding due to changes made during the redesign. The Federal Circuit disagreed and held that the District Court “used the proper standard in its analysis,”[3] the KSM test. The Federal Circuit concluded there was no “abuse of discretion in the court’s decision to hold contempt proceedings,”[3] In addition, the Federal Circuit was persuaded that the District Court could find EchoStar in contempt of the Infringement Provision and that there was “clear and convincing evidence"[3][12] to do so. With regards to the Disablement Provision, the Federal Circuit held a plain reading “would have provided EchoStar with notice of what is now being held in contempt;”[3] furthermore, the chance to appeal the provision language has passed. The amendment to the permanent injunction which required EchoStar Crop. to seek pre-approval for any new design-around effort was affirmed.[3][12]
Dissenting Opinion (Circuit Judge Rader)

“Indeed, the only thing that is not different [about this case] is the identity of the parties themselves. These differences deserve a trial, not a summary contempt proceeding.” ~Circuit Judge Rader[3]

Judge Rader argued the District Court’s injunction was too broad and ambiguously worded.[12] Furthermore, the dissenting opinion argued “TiVo should not be able to bootstrap its new, previously abandoned infringement theory to that [previous] verdict,”[3] because this “discourages good faith efforts to design around an infringement verdict.”[3]
TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp., No. 2009-1374 (Fed. Cir. April 20, 2011) (en banc)[edit]
Majority Opinion (Circuit Judges Lourie, Newman, Mayer, Bryson, Moore, O’Malley, and Reyna; In Part Chief Circuit Judge Rader, Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, Dyk, and Prost)
EchoStar Corp. petitioned for a rehearing en banc by the Federal Circuit to challenge “the enforceability of the District Court's injunction based on overbreadth and vagueness.”[4] Upon review, the en banc Federal Circuit overruled the case which the KSM test was from, “we conclude that KSM's two-step inquiry has been unworkable and now overrule that holding of KSM.”[4] The en banc Federal Circuit replaced the KSM test with a straight “more than colorable difference test.”[8] As a result of the application of the new test, the en banc Federal Circuit vacated the District Court’s finding of contempt for violating the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.[4] However, the en banc Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s holding with regards to the Disablement Provision; thus, affirming the District Court’s finding of contempt.[4][8] The en banc Federal Circuit found EchoStar Corp’s arguments for overbreath and vagueness in the permanent injunction “unpersuasive.”[4]
The original jury award was vacated; however, the contempt sanctions were affirmed.[4][9] In addition, the District Court’s holding of infringement provision contempt was remanded “to make a finding concerning any colorable difference between the previously adjudicated infringing devices and the newly accused devices”[4] using the new test laid out in this case.
Dissenting Opinion (Chief Circuit Judge Rader; and Circuit Judges Gajarsa, Linn, and Prost)
The dissenting opinion focused on the Disablement Provision of the permanent injunction, which argued that the finding of contempt should have been reversed outright.[4][8] “In my view, the disablement provision does not bar the installation of modified software that renders the devices non-infringing, and, even if the provision were unclear, an unclear injunction cannot be the basis for contempt.”[4] In addition, the dissenting opinion argued this case should not be remanded to the lower court due to the Infringement Provision since “that provision plainly was not violated.”[4]
Precedent established[edit]

“The ruling seems to make it easier to initiate contempt proceedings but harder to prove contempt [for continued infringement].” ~Carlos Perez-Albuerne, partner at Choate Hall & Stewart[13]

As a result of the en banc ruling of the Federal Circuit, a new test to determine whether an adjudged infringer can be held in contempt for continued infringement was implemented.[13] This new test replaced the old two-step KSM test from the 1985 decision in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc.[4] The new test “raised the bar for proving that defendant committed contempt” by requiring that a patentee show “the elements found infringing in the original product without significant change in the redesign.”[13] The KSM test required that the original and redesign were “generally similar.”[13] In addition, the patentee must “show that the defendant’s redesigned product infringes upon the same patent claims as the original product.”[13]

EchoStar Corporation is a premier global provider of satellite communication solutions through its Hughes Network Systems and EchoStar Satellite Services business segments. It is the owner and operator of the satellite fleet for closely affiliated DISH.
Prior to the complete of a transaction with DISH on March 1, 2017, the company also designed and manufactured set-top boxes for DISH, Bell TV in Canada, and to receive the Freeview broadcasts in the United Kingdom. It also owned Sling Media, which designs and builds the Slingbox TV streaming device. Prior to 2008, it operated the Dish Network service brand, which was spun off as DISH on January 1, 2008.

History[edit]
EchoStar was originally formed in 1980 by its chairman Charles Ergen as a distributor of C band TV systems. In 1987, it applied for a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to orbital slot 119° west longitude in 1992.
On December 28, 1995, the firm successfully launched its first satellite, EchoStar I. On March 4, 1996, it established the Dish Network brand name to market its home satellite TV system.
In 1998, EchoStar purchased the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of News Corporation's ASkyB and MCI Worldcom. With this purchase the firm obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° W orbital slot, more than doubling existing CONUS broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million. The acquisition inspired the company to introduce a multi-satellite system called DISH 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one dish.
"Legacy" represent the 950 to 1450 MHz frequencies used to deliver the signal throughout the home; the signal is broadcast to the home on the Ku band from satellite (12.2-12.7 GHz). Ku frequencies will not work on home wiring, the signal is downconverted to the intermediate frequency (IF) of 950-1450 MHz at the dish antenna. Newer technology (DishPro) also uses 1650-2150 MHz in addition to 950-1450.
Also in 1998, the firm, in association with Bell Canada, launched Bell TV. On September 25, 2007, the firm announced it had agreed to acquire Sling Media, Inc.
On January 2, 2008, the Dish Network business was demerged from the technology and infrastructure side of the business. A split in the shares created two companies, DISH Network Corporation which consists mainly of the DISH Network business, and EchoStar Corporation which retains ownership of the technology side including the satellites, Sling Media, and the set-top box development arm. DISH Network completed its distribution to Echostar of its digital set-top box business, certain infrastructure, and other assets and related liabilities, including certain of their satellites, uplink and satellite transmission assets, and real estate (the "Spin-off"). Since the Spin-off, EchoStar and DISH Network have operated as separate publicly-traded companies. However, as a result of the Satellite and Tracking Stock Transaction, DISH Network owns shares of EchoStar and their subsidiary's preferred tracking stock representing an aggregate 80.0% economic interest in the residential retail satellite broadband business of their Hughes segment. In addition, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, Chairman, and by certain trusts established by Mr. Ergen for the benefit of his family.
On February 14, 2011, EchoStar announced that it would acquire Hughes Communications in a deal valued at US$1.3 billion.[3]
TiVo patent lawsuit[edit]
Main article: TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp.
On June 3, 2009, satellite service provider EchoStar was found by Marshall, Texas, federal district court judge David Folsom to be in contempt of a permanent injunction against using some of TiVo's technology and was required to pay the DVR pioneer $103.1 million plus interest.
On May 3, 2011, Dish Network Corporation and EchoStar Corporation agreed to pay TiVo Inc. $500 million to settle a dispute over the use of some of TiVo’s technology.[4]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
