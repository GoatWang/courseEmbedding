	DCP Midstream - Community Investment

















































Community Investment






Safety & Sustainability > Community Investment
We’re proud to be part of hundreds of communities — covering our footprint in 17 states. As part of our investment, we partner nationally and locally with several organizations dedicated to ensuring strong and vibrant communities.
Our philanthropic areas of focus include:

Emergency Preparedness and Response
Across our geographic footprint, we value the contribution and partnership of the hundreds of first responder organizations who serve communities in calm and in crisis. We are proud to work alongside these organizations to ensure safe communities.

DCP Midstream is also proud to partner with the American Red Cross in their efforts to support people affected by disaster, that communities are ready and prepared for disasters, everyone has access to safe, lifesaving blood and blood products, members of our armed services and their families find support and comfort, and in an emergency, there are trained individuals ready to use their Red Cross skills to save lives.

 
Recognition of Veterans' Contributions
We believe that veterans who have served our country proudly already can serve our country again by helping to be part of securing domestic energy. In recognition of veterans who have served our country, DCP created a program called Operation Next to provide support to veterans as they transition back into civilian life. Through Operation Next, DCP supports veterans with education assistance and transition to energy jobs, counseling and family support, career coaching, and other reintegration needs.

We are proud to work with The Denver Foundation to identify organizations and to grant funds through our DCP Charitable Fund at The Denver Foundation.


 
Healthier Communities and Employees
 We join the American Heart Association in their mission to reduce heart and stroke risk by 20 percent by 2020. DCP is the largest Heart Walk fundraiser in the country, contributing over $3 million. This is aligned with DCP’s focus on employee well-being.

DENVER, Jan.  04, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DCP Midstream, LLC (Midstream), a 50/50 joint venture between Phillips 66 and Spectra Energy (Owners), and DCP Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:DPM), today announced that they have signed and closed a transaction combining all of the assets and debt of Midstream with DPM (Transaction), simplifying the corporate structure and creating the largest natural gas liquids (NGL) producer and gas processor in the United States. On January 23, 2017, the combined company will be renamed DCP Midstream, LP and the New York Stock Exchange stock ticker symbol will be changed to “DCP”. Transaction Summary Under terms of the Transaction, Midstream has contributed subsidiaries owning all of its assets to DPM, plus $424 million of cash, in exchange for approximately 31.1 million DPM units ($1.125 billion) and DPM assuming $3.15 billion of Midstream debt, for an estimated transaction multiple of approximately eight times based on current commodity strip prices. The cash proceeds of $424 million contributed to DPM will be used to repay its revolver, fund its growth projects or prefund repayment of DPM debt maturing in December 2017. The Owners have retained their 50/50 joint ownership of DCP Midstream, LLC, which owns the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) and 38 percent of the outstanding DPM general and limited partner units. The terms of the Transaction were unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of DCP Midstream and DCP Midstream Partners based on the unanimous approval and recommendation of the Conflicts Committee, which is comprised of independent directors. “This transformational transaction provides a platform of premier assets with strong growth opportunities in the key U.S. producing basins at a multiple that paves the way towards future distribution growth,” said Wouter van Kempen, chairman, president and CEO of both DCP Midstream and DCP Midstream Partners. "The transaction benefits both our unitholders and our Owners with a simplified structure and is the logical progression following our successful DCP 2020 strategy execution to date. We’ve added fee-based margins, sold non-core assets, strengthened Midstream’s balance sheet and reset the overall cost structure of the DCP enterprise to make the assets more MLP-friendly." "Our combined diversified portfolio provides highly accretive bolt-on expansion opportunities starting with the DJ Basin, where we will build a new 200 million-cubic-feet-per-day (MMcf/d) processing plant that is expected to come online in late 2018 with an additional 200 MMcf/d plant in 2019, resulting in a 50 percent increase in DJ Basin capacity. Additionally, we are expanding our Sand Hills NGL pipeline to its full 365 thousand barrels per day (BPD) of capacity by the end of 2017, an increase of 30 percent," added van Kempen. “Our teams have done great work with key producers to create accretive organic growth projects in the DJ and Delaware Basins.” Compelling Value Proposition Creates largest NGL producer and gas processor in the U.S.: The combination creates the largest gathering and processing Master Limited Partnership in the United States with a pro-forma enterprise value of approximately $11 billion.Win-win combination is immediately accretive and provides strong alignment between GP and LP unitholders: The Transaction is projected to be distributable cash flow (DCF) accretive to DPM unitholders at current strip prices. Expected strong returns from organic growth projects, combined with a sustained improvement in the industry environment, will provide DPM with a path to future distribution growth for both the Owners and LP unitholders.Strong growth platform: The combination of legacy integrated footprints brings together DPM’s existing assets with Midstream’s premier assets in the Delaware and Permian Basins, the DJ Basin and the Midcontinent, as well as an additional one-third interest in both Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines. As the largest NGL producer and gas processor, the newly combined DPM has a footprint that creates a strong, long-term platform for organic growth opportunities in the premier basins in the U.S., starting with expansion projects in the DJ Basin and on Sand Hills Pipeline.Strong Owner alignment and support: The Transaction increases Phillips 66 and Spectra Energy’s ownership in DPM to 38 percent allowing owners greater participation in increased earnings from future growth opportunities at the MLP. To support a minimum 1.0 times distribution coverage ratio, the Owners have agreed, if required, to provide IDR givebacks up to $100 million annually through 2019 which provides downside protection for LP unitholders.Enhanced upside potential coupled with fee-based cash flows: The DCP 2020 strategy has reset the combined company with cost reductions, improved asset reliability and increased fee-based earnings. In 2017, 70 percent of the pro-forma margin is either fee-based or hedged, providing downside protection while preserving upside potential in an improving commodity environment. Significant Expansion Projects Announced in the DJ Basin and on Sand Hills Pipeline DJ Basin ExpansionDPM will construct a new 200 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant (Mewbourn 3) in the DJ Basin, its tenth plant in the basin, projected to be in service by the end of 2018. Additionally, DCP collaborated with several key producers to form a cooperative development plan which provides a framework to add another 200 MMcf/d plant by mid-2019. Together, these projects will increase capacity by 50 percent to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day to support growing processing needs of producers. DPM will also complete the next phase of its Grand Parkway low pressure gathering project and associated compression expansions by the end of 2018. DPM is in the process of constructing additional field compression and plant bypass infrastructure that will add approximately 40 MMcf/d of incremental capacity during the summer of 2017. The new plants will connect to the Front Range Pipeline, one-third owned by DPM, for NGL takeaway to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Total capital investment for the plant and associated gathering is expected to be up to $395 million. Sand Hills Pipeline ExpansionDPM will expand NGL takeaway capacity on Sand Hills Pipeline by 30 percent, or 85,000 barrels per day (BPD) to 365,000 BPD, through the addition of four pump stations and a pipeline loop (Sand Hills expansion) to meet NGL production growth from owned and third party plants in the Delaware Basin. Total capital investment for the Sand Hills expansion is approximately $70 million, with an expected in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2017. The newly combined DPM owns two-thirds interest in Sand Hills and Phillips 66 Partners owns the remaining one-third interest and each will fund their proportionate share of the expansion. Sand Hills provides NGL takeaway capacity to the Mont Belvieu market from both owned and third party plants in the growing Permian Basin, including Southeast New Mexico, Delaware Basin, and Cline Shale of West Texas.
