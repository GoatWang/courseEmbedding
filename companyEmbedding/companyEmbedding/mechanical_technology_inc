Mechanical Technology Inc. sold more than $7.1 million in gauges, sensors and measuring devices last year as product revenue increased 11 percent during a transformational year that brought in new investors, board members and a chief executive officer.
The Albany, New York, test equipment maker engineered a big turnaround in 2016. One year after enduring a $2.83 million net loss, Mechanical Technology secured a new contract with the U.S. Air Force and sold more products through an Asian distributor. Those increases, combined with lower material and staff costs, helped the company reduce its net loss to $359,000 last year.

Mechanical Technology signed a multi-year contract with the Air Force in July worth up to $9.35 million. The Air Force has agreed to purchase vibration measurement and balancing equipment. Mechanical Technology also will perform maintenance to devices the Air Force previously acquired.




The Albany Business Review reported last month on the changes Mechanical Technology has made to improve its balance sheet over the past five years since the company decided to abandon efforts to take a methanol-powered fuel-cell device to market. The manufacturer, which is traded over the counter under the OTC: MKTY stock ticker, was founded in 1961 by former General Electric scientists Beno Sternlicht and Harry Apkarian.




 


Mechanical Technology makes devices that are sold to large aerospace customers, the military and manufacturers of gas turbines and computer chips. The technology can measure distances, thickness and help jet makers balance massive engines. It also provides engineers with data to identify and fix problems when engines are unbalanced.
Last fall, New York City private equity firm Brookstone Partners purchased 3.75 million shares of MTI stock for $2.74 million. Brookstone now controls just under 42 percent of MTI stock and holds three seats on MTI's seven-member board. Together, the companies are working to make what would be MTI's first large acquisition in 30 years. Brookstone and MTI are searching for instrument companies with annual revenue of $10 million to $30 million.
In January, Mechanical Technology announced CEO Kevin Lynch was retiring. He was succeeded by chief financial officer Rick Jones, who now holds the titles of president, CEO and CFO.

					Full Description



Mechanical Technology, Incorporated, incorporated on October 4, 1961, conducts operations through its subsidiary, MTI Instruments, Inc. (MTI Instruments). MTI Instruments supplies precision linear displacement solutions, vibration measurement and system balancing solutions, and wafer inspection tools. MTI Instruments serves markets that require precise measurements and control of products and processes in automated manufacturing, assembly and operation of machinery; metrology tools for semiconductor and solar wafer characterization; tensile stage systems for materials testing and precision linear displacement gauges for use in academic and industrial research and development settings, and engine balancing and vibration analysis systems for both military and commercial aircraft. MTI Instruments provides its customers with enabling sensors and sensing technologies. It customizes linear displacement solutions for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that can be incorporated into a tool or equipment manufactured by a company to monitor performance and/or achieve control (in product application) or into a process to control the manufacture of parts or measure critical parameters of parts as they enter or leave a process (in process applications).The Company's product offerings include Accumeasure Series, Microtrak 4, Microtrak PRO-2D, MTI-2100 Fotonic Sensor Series, Accumeasure D Series and Microtrak TGS. Accumeasure Series is an ultra-high precision capacitive system offering nanometer accuracy. Microtrak 4 is a single spot laser sensor equipped with the metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor technology. Microtrak PRO-2D is a two-dimensional (2D) laser triangulation scanner that provides profile, displacement and three-dimensional (3D) images. MTI-2100 Fotonic Sensor Series are fiber-optic based displacement sensor systems with high frequency response. Accumeasure D Series are ultra-high precision digital capacitive systems offering sub-nanometer accuracy. Microtrak TGS is an intuitive laser thickness system using over two single spot laser heads with digital linearization.MTI Instruments also develops and commercializes vibration measurement and system balancing for axial type engines, typically medium and large turbo fan aircraft engines for both military and commercial applications. MTI Instruments designs and manufactures computer-based portable balancing systems (PBS) products, which automatically collect and record engine vibration data, identifying vibration or balance trouble, and calculating a solution to the problem. MTI Instruments' Turbo Machinery product offerings and technologies include PBS-4100+ Portable Balancing System, PBS-4100R+ Test Cell Vibration Analysis & Trim Balancing System, TSC-4800A Tachometer Signal Conditioner and 1510A Calibrator. PBS-4100+ Portable Balancing System provides solutions for engine vibration and trim balancing problems. PBS-4100R+ Test Cell Vibration Analysis & Trim Balancing System offers trim balancing and diagnostic for engine test cells. TSC-4800A Tachometer Signal Conditioner detects and conditions signals for monitoring, measuring, and indicating engine speeds. 1510A Calibrator is a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable signal generator that outputs voltage signals useful to test and calibrate electronic equipment.The Company offers a line of tabletop linear displacement instruments, material testers and wafer metrology tools. Its family of research and development (R&D) related products are used in applications, including wafer surface metrology, nano-material testing, and precision linear displacement and positioning. Its customers include testing and R&D departments in large industry and academia, as well as process development laboratories focused in automotive, electronics, semiconductor, solar, and material development. MTI Instruments' Industrial and Academic Research and Development product offerings and technologies include Accumeasure Digital Series, Accumeasure Analog Series, Semtester Tensile Stages, Microtrak 4, Proforma 300i, PV 1000 and MTI-2100 Fotonic Sensor Series. Accumeasure Digital Series is an ultra-high precision digital capacitive system offering sub-nanometer accuracy.Accumeasure Analog Series is an ultra-high precision capacitive displacement system offering nanometer accuracy. Semtester Tensile Stages are tensile testers designed for use inside scanning electron microscopes and light microscopes. Proforma 300i is used for manual, non-contact measurement of semiconductor wafer thickness and bow, among others. PV 1000 is a manual tool for measuring thickness and bow of solar wafers. MTI Instruments markets its products and services using selected and specific channels of distribution. In the Americas, for precision automated manufacturing and the R&D sectors, MTI Instruments uses a combination of direct sales and representatives. Overseas, particularly in Europe and Asia, MTI Instruments uses distributors and agents specific to its targeted end markets. For axial turbo machinery, MTI Instruments primarily sells directly to end users.The Company competes with Keyence, Micro Epsilon, Schmitt Industries, Capacitec, Lion Precision Instruments, ACES Systems, Meggitt Sensing Systems, Gatan, Deben and E+H (Eichhorn+Hausmann) GmbH.
