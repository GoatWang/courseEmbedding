James River Group Holdings, Ltd. ("James River Holdings", or "the Company") is a Bermuda-based insurance holding company. We own and operate a group of specialty insurance and reinsurance companies founded by members of our management team. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 80% of our group-wide net written premiums originated from the U.S. excess and surplus ("E&S") lines market. Substantially all of our business is casualty insurance and reinsurance, and for the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 99% of our group-wide net written premiums from casualty insurance and reinsurance. Our objective is to generate compelling returns on tangible equity, while limiting underwriting and investment volatility. We seek to accomplish this by earning profits from insurance and reinsurance underwriting on a consistent basis while managing our capital opportunistically to grow tangible equity per share for our shareholders. Our group includes three specialty property-casualty insurance and reinsurance segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Specialty Admitted Insurance and Casualty Reinsurance. In all of our segments, we tend to focus on accounts associated with small or medium-sized businesses.
