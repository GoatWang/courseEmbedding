Content & Media Segment
The company's online nostalgia websites have historically enabled users to locate and interact with acquaintances from their past, with high school affiliations as the primary focus. The company's increasing focus on nostalgia in its U.S. operations led to the launch of MemoryLane.com, a premier provider of nostalgic content from the years 1940 through 1999.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Universal Electronics (NASDAQ:UEIC) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.75)Consensus Price Target: $75.08 (11.57% upside)
