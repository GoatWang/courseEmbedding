Press Releases



Aytu BioScience Announces the Acquisition of Nuelle, Inc., Developer and Marketer of Fiera® Female Personal Care Device






May 9, 2017, 8:05am EDT














ENGLEWOOD, Colo., May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aytu BioScience, Inc. (OTCQX: AYTU), a specialty life sciences company focused on global commercialization of novel products in the field of urology, today announced the acquisition of Nuelle, Inc. ('Nuelle"), a women's sexual health company.  This transaction expands the Company's product portfolio with the addition of the Fiera® personal care device for women.  Fiera was recently launched in the United States and is a proprietary, revenue-generating product scientifically proven to enhance physical arousal and sexual desire in the millions of adult women around the world impacted by changes in sexual desire.



Aytu's acquisition of Nuelle adds a novel, commercial-stage product in a complementary adjacency readily accessible by the Company's U.S.-based commercial infrastructure.  Aytu acquired Nuelle through a two-step merger process whereby Nuelle became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aytu.   Nuelle was previously a portfolio company of leading venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates (NEA). Nuelle was founded within ExploraMed, a health technology incubator based in Mountain View, California.
Fiera is a revenue-generating women's personal care product marketed in the United States primarily through consumer promotion.  In scientific and consumer studies conducted with hundreds of women with stated sexual desire and response concerns, Fiera has demonstrated highly consistent benefit. Importantly, Fiera is also endorsed by and receives professional recommendations from leading sexual health experts across the United States and has been studied and presented by the same experts.
Josh Disbrow, Aytu's Chief Executive Officer stated, "We are very excited about the acquisition of Nuelle and entering the growing women's sexual health category with Fiera.  Having Nuelle as a subsidiary enables us to broaden our product offerings while Aytu maintains its focus on Natesto and MiOXSYS.  Additionally, we believe we can efficiently leverage Aytu's commercial infrastructure to integrate Fiera and drive awareness among healthcare professionals of this important need and product for women.  Sexual desire and arousal concerns are a significant issue affecting millions of women around the world, and there are limited options available to address this growing need.  We believe that Fiera can help dramatically improve the lives of these women in need of a proven solution while we work to realize the full commercial potential of this novel product." 
"NEA is a strong supporter of companies focused on advancing women's health", stated Dr. Josh Makower, General Partner at NEA, "and Nuelle represents an important part of that strategy.  We believe the leadership of Aytu has the vision necessary to create a strong platform upon which Fiera will be able to realize its full potential."
Details of the merger transaction are available on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 9, 2017, which is available in the Investors section on aytubio.com and on the Securities and Exchange Commission website. 
About Aytu BioScience, Inc.
Aytu BioScience is a commercial-stage specialty life sciences company focused on global commercialization of novel products in the field of urology, with a focus on products addressing vitality, sexual wellness, and reproductive health. The company currently markets two prescription products in the U.S.: Natesto®, the first and only FDA-approved nasal formulation of testosterone for men with hypogonadism (low testosterone, or "Low T") and ProstaScint® (capromab pendetide), the only FDA-approved imaging agent specific to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for prostate cancer detection and staging.  Additionally, Aytu is developing MiOXSYS®, a novel, rapid semen analysis system with the potential to become a standard of care for the diagnosis and management of male infertility caused by oxidative stress. MiOXSYS is commercialized outside the U.S. where it is a CE Marked, Health Canada cleared product, and Aytu is planning U.S.-based clinical trials in pursuit of 510k medical device clearance by the FDA. Aytu's strategy is to continue building its portfolio of revenue-generating products, leveraging its focused commercial team and expertise to build leading brands within growing markets. For more information visit aytubio.com.  Aytu also now owns wholly-owned subsidiary Nuelle, Inc., a personal health and wellness company focused on women's sexual wellbeing and intimacy that markets Fiera, a personal care device for women that is scientifically proven to enhance physical arousal and sexual desire. Fiera is a consumer device and is not intended to treat, mitigate, or cure any disease or medical condition.
