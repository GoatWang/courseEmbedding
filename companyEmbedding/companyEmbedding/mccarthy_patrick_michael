Light A Candle


















Longtime Indian Wells resident Patrick McCarthy (82) died February 4, 2017 at his home with his loving wife at his side. His passing was due to complication from cancer and a virus infection.
Patrick was born in Los Angeles on November 5, 1934. He moved with his family to New York in 1938 and spent the next 60 years there. Patrick served in the United States Navy before representing Merrill Lynch at the New York Stock Exchange. He retired in 1996 and he and his wife moved to California.
Patrick is lovingly remembered for an unfailingly courteous attitude and with a disarmingly quick wit and storytelling. He was always ready with jokes and anecdotes to cause smiles to all around him. He was passionate about his wife Edeltraud, his Irish heritage, classic cars, playing Bridge, and philanthropic giving to so many worthy and deserving causes; among them are Desert Arc, COD, Health Family Foundation, The Living Desert, Loma Linda, Deerfield Academy, McCallum Theatre, Desert Symphony, Olive Crest and many others.
Patrick leaves behind his wife, Edeltraud; daughter and two sons: Michele, Patrick, and Brian, all of New York; and three grandchildren; Michael, Sean and Ryan.
A Celebration of Life to honor Patrick is planned for 10:00am Wednesday, February 22, at Saint Francis of Assisi, 47225 Washington St., La Quinta.
In lieu of flowers, please make a donation in Patrick's name to Desert Arc.
FitzHenry-Wiefels Palm Desert has been entrusted with arrangements.

So very, very sorry to get the news of Patrick's death. He and I go way, way back to our freshman dormitory at Deerfield in the Fall of 1949 - sixty-seven years ago. Neither of us was phi beta kappa so we were in a lot of small classes together as well as a dormitory. We were both at college in Providence in the '50s, he at PC and I at Brown so we occasionally did the town together! Pat was a legend on the Cross Country track at Deerfield and in my four years there I never saw him beaten. And that's how he earned his nickname The Flying Irishman. Sadly The Flying Irishman has won his last race, and we his Deerfield Academy Class of 1953 will never, ever forget our classmate Patrick. Deepest love and sympathy to you, Edeltraud, and your whole family from the Class of 1953 at Deerfield Academy - Hugh R. Smith

Patrick Michael McCarthy, AKA ,The Flying Irishman Deerfield Academy Class of 1953.My good friend, what a ride we had during those formative years. We beat all the odds makers and made it past 80+. I sent a text to God requesting that he take good care of you, as you have given so much, to so many, for the support of needy projects and institutions. You will be sorely missed by all those of us who cherished your deep friendship.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
