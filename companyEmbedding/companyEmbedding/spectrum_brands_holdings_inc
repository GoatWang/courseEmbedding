Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is an American diversified company established in 2005 as the successor company to Rayovac Corporation. Rayovac had been located in Wisconsin since its conception as The French Battery Company in 1906. Rayovac, as a division of Spectrum Brands, remained headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, along with Remington even while the parent company, Spectrum Brands, was headquartered in Georgia. On April 15, 2010 Spectrum Brands announced that it would be moving Corporate Headquarters back to Madison, WI. Spectrum Brands moved its Headquarters to Middleton, WI in October 2013.
The company manufactures and markets batteries under the Rayovac and Varta brand names, home appliances under the Remington, Russell Hobbs and George Foreman brand names, lawn and garden care products under the Spectracide and Garden Safe brand names, insect repellents under the Cutter and Repel brand names.[3] Spectrum owns several pet care companies both in the aquarium supply and companion animal trades. In the aquarium business, Spectrum owns Tetra, Whisper, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, Instant Ocean, Visi-Therm, and other product lines. Companion animal lines consist of Dingo, Lazy Pet, Wonderbox, and others. Both aquarium lines and companion lines are concentrated into Spectrum's United Pet Group based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

History[edit]




Ray-O-Vac D-size battery


In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]




Rayovac 1.5V 'C' battery


Rayovac manufactures alkaline batteries ranging in size from AAA to 9V, rechargeable NiMH batteries, hearing aid batteries, lithium photo batteries, specialty batteries and portable power chargers. In addition, a variety of portable LED flashlights and lanterns are produced under the Rayovac brand.[11]

In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]




Rayovac 1.5V 'C' battery


Rayovac manufactures alkaline batteries ranging in size from AAA to 9V, rechargeable NiMH batteries, hearing aid batteries, lithium photo batteries, specialty batteries and portable power chargers. In addition, a variety of portable LED flashlights and lanterns are produced under the Rayovac brand.[11]

In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]




Rayovac 1.5V 'C' battery


Rayovac manufactures alkaline batteries ranging in size from AAA to 9V, rechargeable NiMH batteries, hearing aid batteries, lithium photo batteries, specialty batteries and portable power chargers. In addition, a variety of portable LED flashlights and lanterns are produced under the Rayovac brand.[11]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. is an American diversified company established in 2005 as the successor company to Rayovac Corporation. Rayovac had been located in Wisconsin since its conception as The French Battery Company in 1906. Rayovac, as a division of Spectrum Brands, remained headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, along with Remington even while the parent company, Spectrum Brands, was headquartered in Georgia. On April 15, 2010 Spectrum Brands announced that it would be moving Corporate Headquarters back to Madison, WI. Spectrum Brands moved its Headquarters to Middleton, WI in October 2013.
The company manufactures and markets batteries under the Rayovac and Varta brand names, home appliances under the Remington, Russell Hobbs and George Foreman brand names, lawn and garden care products under the Spectracide and Garden Safe brand names, insect repellents under the Cutter and Repel brand names.[3] Spectrum owns several pet care companies both in the aquarium supply and companion animal trades. In the aquarium business, Spectrum owns Tetra, Whisper, Marineland, Perfecto, Jungle, Instant Ocean, Visi-Therm, and other product lines. Companion animal lines consist of Dingo, Lazy Pet, Wonderbox, and others. Both aquarium lines and companion lines are concentrated into Spectrum's United Pet Group based in Cincinnati, Ohio.

History[edit]




Ray-O-Vac D-size battery


In 1906, the French Battery Co. was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by James Bowen Ramsay (1869-1952), with Alfred Landau as its first president. In 1910, Landau was replaced by C.F. Burgess, and the company became profitable. After a fire destroyed the plant in 1915, Burgess left to found his own company. Production rose during the First World War, and by 1920, the French company had US$2.74 million in sales and 600 employees, and 1000 employees in 1931.[4]
In 1930, the company name was changed to Ray-O-Vac, an allusion to the then-new technology of vacuum tubes and electron rays. In 1933, the company patented the first wearable vacuum tube hearing aid.[5]
During its ownership by the parent company of ESB Industrials, a British subsidiary was established to manufacture and market batteries in the United Kingdom under the Ray-O-Vac name. This operation ceased in 1972; Ray-O-Vac batteries continued to be marketed, although they were manufactured by the British Ever Ready company.[citation needed] In 1988, the name was simplified to Rayovac.
Diversification and name change[edit]
In 2003, Rayovac decided to diversify,[3] and acquired non-battery related businesses including Remington Products and United Pet Group. In 2004, Rayovac successfully underbid Energizer (Eveready) as RadioShack's battery supplier and produced the "Enercell" brand of battery sold exclusively at RadioShack. In January 2005, Rayovac purchased United Industries Corporation for about $476 million in cash and stock. Brands included in United Industries were Vigoro, Spectracide and Sta-Green lawn products, Cutter, Hot Shot and Repel insect control products and pet supply products with the Marineland, Perfecto, and Eight in One brands.[6] In 2005, Tetra, a major provider of pet-fish products, was acquired. This diversification prompted the name change from Rayovac to Spectrum Brands.[3]
Rayovac also bought other battery companies including Varta, Ningbo Baowang and Microlite S.A.. The Microlite acquisition included the rights to the Rayovac name in Brazil, giving the company worldwide rights to the Rayovac name.[7] With this acquisition, Rayovac consolidated its presence in the majority of countries in Latin America. Rayovac is a well recognized brand in this region.
Heavily leveraged in debt, Spectrum attempted to sell its pet division (United Pet Group) containing aquarium products and supplies under the Tetra, Marineland, Instant Ocean and Jungle brand names, and pet care products under the Dingo, Firstrax, 8 in 1 and Nature's Miracles brand names. Appliance maker Salton, owned by hedge fund Harbinger Capital, agreed to pay approximately $692 million cash to purchase the pet care division, but the deal collapsed on July 14, 2008. According to Forbes and The Wall Street Journal, the sale was rejected by Spectrum's own key lenders, most likely because the deal valued the brands for less than what the bankers considered them to be worth.[citation needed]
On February 3, 2009, Spectrum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[8] The company later emerged from bankruptcy on August 28, 2009.[2][9] Since emerging from Chapter 11, Spectrum has announced year-over-year increases in sales and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of their fiscal 2010.
Russell Hobbs Inc.[edit]
Spectrum Brands finalized a merger with Russell Hobbs Inc. (formerly known as Salton, Inc.) on June 16, 2010, to form a new $3 billion consumer products company. Russell Hobbs' brands include George Foreman Grill, Toastmaster, Black & Decker Home appliances, and Russell Hobbs.
Armored AutoGroup[edit]
On April 28, 2015, Spectrum Brands entered the automotive supply business by acquiring Armored AutoGroup which makes Armor All finishes and STP automotive chemicals among other products.[10]
Battery products[edit]

ST. LOUIS, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- From July 24-26, 2017, the Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden Division will exhibit in booth #3535 at the SuperZoo Conference at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nev., new products and innovative retail displays and packagingdesigned for a positive shopping experience for pet owners. 








"Trends indicate that pet owners identify with a sense of pet 'parenting' more than pet 'ownership.' To serve their needs and desire for optimal pet care, we developed enticing options for nutrition, grooming, maintenance and cleaning," said John Pailthorp, Vice President of Marketing, Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden Division. "And we serve retailers' needs through new products, clean packaging and educational displays that have been tested worldwide and resonate well with consumers."
Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden invites attendees to experience its full portfolio of pet care solutions for a wide variety of needs. Representing its Aquatics division will be Tetra®, Marineland®, Instant Ocean® and GloFish® brands. Its Companion Animal division will be represented by Nature's Miracle®, ProSense®, LitterMaid®, Dingo®, FURminator®, Perfect Coat®, Wild Harvest™ and eCOTRITION™ brands.
Enhancing the Aquatic Hobby
To create a tangible, visual guide to the latest in fishkeeping, the Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden booth will feature new Tetra® products, next-generation packaging, nutrition and the latest marketing tools to support pet retailers as they help consumers succeed and thrive. 

Making Betta Food, Better FoodTetra® brand has worked for decades to innovate the nutrition fishkeepers feed to their pets. That tradition continues with new Tetra® Betta Worm Shaped Bites™, which will be displayed for the first time at the SuperZoo Conference. Visitors will be able to get a close look at the new product and packaging, and ask questions about this complete, balanced diet for bettas and gouramis. 
Providing a Complete Water Care Regimen When consumers are more educated about water care, they are more successful and satisfied with fishkeeping. Tetra® brand will feature its new water care regimen slide-out box to see the recommended Tetra® products first-hand. Visitors can experience this new display, which reinforces to retailers that "when (customers) succeed, so do you" and gives a clear guide on how to use Tetra® water care products to take care of aquariums. With its next-generation Tetra® packaging, the display defines the features and benefits for Tetra® AquaSafe® (conditions water), Tetra® Cleaning Bacteria (cleans water / adds healthy bacteria), and Tetra® EasyBalance® (balances vital elements). 
Offering a Well-Balanced Nutrition Regimen for Fish To make nutrition completely easy for consumers and serve as an aid to pet retailers, Tetra® brand has also created a new nutrition regimen slide-out box that will be displayed for visitors to offer a hands-on experience. The area will display new nutrition packaging that promotes the main benefits of each product as well as the specific fish body type that each food was designed to feed. 
Experiencing a GloFish® GalleryPet retailers can EXPERIENCE THE GLO!® in a darkened room dedicated to GloFish® Fluorescent Fish, offering a unique aquatic experience. A live aquarium will be filled with brilliantly-colored tetras, barbs and danios and the latest GloFish® line décor and accessories. Under the new GloFish® Cycle Light, visitors will see the environment transform before their eyes. The GloFish® Color-Changing Background, Plants and Ornaments change colors as the lighting rotates through a cycle of blue LED, black LED and white light.

Enhancing the Experience of Pet Ownership
Because dogs, cats, birds and small animals are all big parts of the personal and professional lives of SuperZoo attendees, the Spectrum Brands, Inc. – Pet, Home & Garden booth #3535 will also host attractive, interactive displays to introduce new Companion Animal packaging and formulations that offer consumers healthy, clean and comfortable lifestyles with their pets.
"As pet ownership continues to climb to new heights, we thoroughly enjoy innovating products that make quality of life for pets better and maintenance easier for their owners," Pailthorp said.

Promoting a Balance Between Pet Parenting and Home OwnershipAs part of the Trust the Miracle™ campaign, Nature's Miracle® will demonstrate how "Pet Parents Can Have Nice Things." The beautiful white lounge of the Nature's Miracle® area announces new formulas for long-term odor elimination, as well as new delivery systems for cleaning carpet. As a universally recognized, "must-have" product, Nature's Miracle® brand will feature its new packaging to give visitors a glimpse at the evolving design of the line. 
Making Pets Jump for JoyThe lively Dingo® display wastes no time showing how the right assortment and selection of rawhide dog bones, dog chews and dog treats may increase sales. This area shows off the new look of Dingo® packaging for its flavored/standard rawhide, rawhide alternative, benefit added, and soft, chewy and crunchy varieties. Visitors will also learn consumer statistics they can use to strategize their store's rawhide offerings and create more engagement. 
Catering to Cat LoversBecause every cat has different litter box needs, LitterMaid® and Nature's Miracle® brands will highlight their range of litter products available for consumers to deal with the toughest litter box odors. Pet retailers will get tips on how to educate their consumers on using litter properly, since seven out of 10 consumers create their litter box routine through trial and error. 
Providing Affordable Care Products for PetsExpanding on the interaction theme of Companion Animal, ProSense® brand is displaying a range of chews, tablets, shampoos and spray solutions for dental, itch and allergy, and joint health applications. Many of these solutions reflect the products that pet parents also use to maintain their own health. In the ProSense® portion of the booth, pet retailers will gain insights on positioning this line to help them better engage their customers by demonstrating their interest in carrying products geared to help improve the quality of life for their pets. 
Solving the Pet Hair ProblemEducation is the most important tool in the fight against pet hair. That's why the FURminator® area details the grooming tasks pet parents should perform daily, weekly and monthly. Each activity is tied to FURminator® products, so visitors know the proper grooming regimen and solutions to recommend to consumers. To help pet retailers understand FURminator® consumers even better, this area features "FURminator® ProSumers" – individuals most likely to seek out pet grooming products and education.

Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended July 2, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Fiscal Year 2017
Jul 27 17
Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the third quarter and nine months ended July 2, 2017. Net sales of $1.30 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 4.2% compared to $1.36 billion last year. Excluding the negative impact of $12.0 million of foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales fell 3.9% from the prior year. Net income of $76.9 million and basic and diluted EPS of $1.31 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased compared to net income of $101.9 million and diluted EPS of $1.71 in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by reduced interest expense. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.71 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 fell 1.2% compared to $1.73 last year primarily due to lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduced interest expense and lower average shares outstanding. Operating income of $157.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 23.7% compared to $206.7 million in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign exchange, incremental costs of $24.9 million from the Pet division U.S. rawhide safety recall, and additional restructuring costs of $15.7 million, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 5.5% compared to $279.2 million in fiscal 2016. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange of $6.7 million and acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $268.0 million decreased 4.0% versus the prior year. Income from operations before income taxes was $103.3 million against $144.6 million a year ago. EBITDA was $205.2 million against $249.8 million a year ago. 

Net sales of $3.69 billion in the nine months of fiscal 2017 decreased 2.8% compared to $3.79 billion for the same period in fiscal 2016. Excluding the negative impact of $40.6 million of foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales in the nine months of fiscal 2017 fell 1.9% from the prior year. Operating income of $453.0 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017 decreased from $497.7 million last year, while operating income margin fell 80 basis points to 12.3% versus 13.1% in 2016. Net income was $201.0 million, or $3.40 diluted EPS, in the nine months of fiscal 2017 on average shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.1 million. In the nine months of fiscal 2016, net income was $268.2 million, or $4.51 diluted EPS, on average shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.5 million. The decrease in net income and EPS was primarily due to increased restructuring-related costs and a higher effective tax rate. The company generated adjusted EPS of $4.11 in the nine months of fiscal 2017, an increase of 5.7% compared to $3.89 last year primarily as a result of operating efficiencies and lower interest costs, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. Fiscal 2017 nine months adjusted EBITDA of $698.2 million declined compared to adjusted EBITDA in the nine months of fiscal 2016 of $715.9 million. Excluding the negative impact of $17.0 million of foreign exchange and acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $712.6 million declined 0.5% in the nine months of fiscal 2017 versus the prior year. Income from operations before income taxes was $291.3 million against $315.4 million a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $162.4 million against $117.9 million a year ago. Purchases of property, plant and equipment was $78.1 million against $59.6 million a year ago. EBITDA was $593.2 million against $627.9 million a year ago. 

The company expects fiscal 2017 reported net sales to grow above category rates for most categories, along with an anticipated negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 70 to 90 basis points. Fiscal 2017 adjusted free cash flow is projected to be approximately $575 million -$590 million compared to $535 million in fiscal 2016. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million, including rollover spending from fiscal 2016. These incremental investments will support footprint optimization, vertical integration improvements, technology and innovation and are expected to enhance the company’s margin structure and organic net sales growth rate. The company expects net cash provided from operating activities to be $680 million - $695 million.

Spectrum Brands Holdings Reports Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Results






                    	July 27, 2017 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time 
                    	



MIDDLETON, Wis.--(EON: Enhanced Online News)--Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products 
      company offering an expanding portfolio of leading brands providing 
      superior value to consumers and customers every day, today reported 
      results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 ended July 2, 2017.
    
“A confluence of factors, some 
      macro and others Company-specific, negatively impacted our results in 
      the quarter.”

      This press release includes non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, 
      adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted 
      EBITDA margin, organic adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. See 
      Other Supplemental Information for reconciliation to comparable GAAP 
      metrics.
    

Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Highlights:



Net sales of $1.30 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
        decreased 4.2 percent compared to $1.36 billion last year. Excluding 
        the negative impact of $12.0 million of foreign exchange and 
        acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales fell 3.9 percent 
        from the prior year.


Net income of $76.9 million and diluted EPS of $1.31 in the third 
        quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased compared to net income of $101.9 
        million and diluted EPS of $1.71 in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower 
        volumes, partially offset by reduced interest expense.


Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.71 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
        fell 1.2 percent compared to $1.73 last year primarily due to lower 
        volumes and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset 
        by reduced interest expense and lower average shares outstanding.


Operating income of $157.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 
        2017 decreased 23.7 percent compared to $206.7 million in fiscal 2016 
        primarily as a result of lower volumes and the negative impact of 
        foreign exchange, incremental costs of $24.9 million from the Pet 
        division U.S. rawhide safety recall, and additional restructuring 
        costs of $15.7 million, partially offset by lower operating expenses.


Operating income margin of 12.1 percent in the third quarter of 
        fiscal 2017 fell 310 basis points compared to 15.2 percent in the 
        prior year.


Adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 
        2017 decreased 5.5 percent compared to $279.2 million in fiscal 2016. 
        Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange of $6.7 million and 
        acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $268.0 
        million decreased 4.0 percent versus the prior year.


Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.2 percent in the third quarter of 
        fiscal 2017 was slightly lower compared to 20.5 percent in fiscal 2016 
        primarily due to mix and the negative impact of foreign exchange.


Adjusted free cash flow is expected to grow to approximately 
        $575-$590 million versus $535 million in fiscal 2016 and $454 million 
        in fiscal 2015, based on expected net cash provided from operating 
        activities of $680-$695 million after expected purchases of property, 
        plant and equipment of $105-$115 million.



      “Our third quarter performance is not representative of the positive 
      outlook we have for our growth prospects, strategic direction and 
      efficient global operating model,” said Andreas Rouvé, Chief Executive 
      Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. “A confluence of factors, some 
      macro and others Company-specific, negatively impacted our results in 
      the quarter.
    

      “Systemic U.S. retailer inventory reduction programs and unfavorable 
      early season weather that reduced customer orders and slowed POS 
      predominantly in our seasonal Home & Garden and Global Auto Care 
      businesses impacted sales by approximately $25 million,” Mr. Rouvé said.
    

      “At the same time, we experienced temporary, transitional supply chain 
      challenges with our HHI U.S. distribution center consolidation in Kansas 
      and the GAC U.S. operating consolidation in Ohio that affected shipping 
      levels in the short-term and impacted sales by approximately $24 
      million,” he said. “However, both projects remain on schedule and the 
      issues are being quickly addressed with delayed shipments shifted into 
      our fourth quarter. Despite the start-up challenges, these major 
      consolidation projects will bring a number of important productivity, 
      efficiency and other benefits, including reduced operating costs, lower 
      working capital and even better service to our customers.
    

      “In addition, our voluntary safety recall on June 10 of certain U.S. 
      rawhide dog chews affected our Pet sales by approximately $11 million 
      and, as expected, the planned exits of low-margin unprofitable 
      businesses of approximately $10 million also impacted our third quarter 
      revenues as we anniversary last year’s exits throughout fiscal 2017,” 
      Mr. Rouvé said.
    

      “On the other hand, we are pleased to report that our e-commerce 
      business was again a bright spot across our entire portfolio with 
      strong, double-digit growth in the third quarter, and we continue to 
      invest more with our retail partners and expand our digital marketing 
      resources especially to drive our innovative and higher-priced 
      products,” he said.
    

      “Despite our third quarter shortfall, we remain confident about our 
      growth prospects as we continue to invest into our innovation pipeline 
      and add resources to pursue our many white space opportunities around 
      the world,” Mr. Rouvé said. “We also completed two accretive 
      acquisitions in our Pet business which we are quickly integrating.”
    

Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Consolidated Financial Results


      Net sales of $1.30 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 
      4.2 percent compared to $1.36 billion in fiscal 2016. Excluding the 
      negative impact of $12.0 million of foreign exchange and acquisition 
      sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales declined 3.9 percent.
    

      Gross profit and gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
      were $473.4 million and 36.3 percent, respectively, compared to $530.6 
      million and 39.0 percent, respectively, last year. The gross profit 
      margin percentage decrease was primarily due to unfavorable mix, the 
      negative impact of the Pet U.S. rawhide safety recall, increased 
      restructuring-related activities and temporary operating start-up 
      inefficiencies, along with the negative impact of foreign exchange.
    

      Operating expenses of $315.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
      fell 2.6 percent compared to $323.9 million in the prior year primarily 
      due to lower general and administrative costs.
    

      Operating income of $157.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
      decreased 23.7 percent versus $206.7 million last year as a result of 
      lower volumes, the negative impact of foreign exchange, the unfavorable 
      impact of the Pet U.S. rawhide safety recall and increased 
      restructuring-related activities. Operating income margin of 12.1 
      percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 310 basis points 
      versus 15.2 percent in 2016.
    

      Net income was $76.9 million, or $1.31 diluted EPS, in the third quarter 
      of fiscal 2017 on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents 
      outstanding of 58.9 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, net 
      income was $101.9 million, or $1.71 diluted EPS, on average diluted 
      shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.6 million. The 
      decrease in net income and diluted EPS was primarily due to reduced 
      volumes, partially offset by lower interest expense. The Company 
      generated adjusted diluted EPS of $1.71 in the third quarter of fiscal 
      2017, a decrease of 1.2 percent versus $1.73 in the prior year.
    

      Adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 
      decreased 5.5 percent compared to $279.2 million in fiscal 2016. 
      Personal care and small appliances reported increased adjusted EBITDA. 
      Excluding the negative impact of $6.7 million of foreign exchange and 
      acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $268.0 
      declined 4.0 percent versus the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Reported 
      adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 30 basis points to 20.2 percent 
      compared to 20.5 percent last year.
    

Fiscal 2017 Nine Months Consolidated Financial Results


      Net sales of $3.69 billion in the nine months of fiscal 2017 decreased 
      2.8 percent compared to $3.79 billion for the same period in fiscal 
      2016. Excluding the negative impact of $40.6 million of foreign exchange 
      and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales in the nine 
      months of fiscal 2017 fell 1.9 percent from the prior year.
    

      Operating income of $453.0 million in the nine months of fiscal 2017 
      decreased from $497.7 million last year, while operating income margin 
      fell 80 basis points to 12.3 percent versus 13.1 percent in 2016.
    

      Net income was $201.0 million, or $3.40 diluted EPS, in the nine months 
      of fiscal 2017 on average shares and common stock equivalents 
      outstanding of 59.1 million. In the nine months of fiscal 2016, net 
      income was $268.2 million, or $4.51 diluted EPS, on average shares and 
      common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.5 million. The decrease in 
      net income and EPS was primarily due to increased restructuring-related 
      costs and a higher effective tax rate. The Company generated adjusted 
      EPS of $4.11 in the nine months of fiscal 2017, an increase of 5.7 
      percent compared to $3.89 last year primarily as a result of operating 
      efficiencies and lower interest costs, partially offset by the negative 
      impact of foreign exchange.
    

      Fiscal 2017 nine months adjusted EBITDA of $698.2 million declined 
      compared to adjusted EBITDA in the nine months of fiscal 2016 of $715.9 
      million. Excluding the negative impact of $17.0 million of foreign 
      exchange and acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA 
      of $712.6 million declined 0.5 percent in the nine months of fiscal 2017 
      versus the prior year. Reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.9 percent 
      in the nine months of fiscal 2017 was unchanged versus fiscal 2016.

      Third quarter net sales decreased primarily due to lower personal care 
      and small appliances revenues. Organic net sales fell 1.0 percent.
    

      Global battery net sales decreased $2.4 million or 1.3 percent. Solid 
      growth in Europe, primarily in alkaline and hearing aid batteries, and 
      in Latin America was offset by lower revenues in the U.S. Excluding 
      negative foreign exchange impacts of $2.4 million, organic net sales 
      were unchanged.
    

      Net sales for the global personal care product category decreased $4.9 
      million or 4.2 percent. Growth in Latin America was more than offset by 
      lower U.S. and European revenues largely attributable to implemented 
      price increases in Europe, increased competitor promotions and sluggish 
      POS in the U.S. Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $2.3 
      million, organic net sales declined 2.2 percent.
    

      Net sales in the global small appliances product category fell $5.7 
      million or 3.8 percent. Higher U.S. revenues from growth in e-commerce 
      and mass channels was more than offset by lower sales in Europe and 
      Latin America from a combination of Brexit-related price increases and 
      exits from unprofitable businesses. Excluding negative foreign exchange 
      impacts of $3.7 million, organic net sales decreased 1.3 percent.
    

      The third quarter operating income decrease was due to lower volumes, 
      the negative impact of foreign exchange and slightly higher depreciation 
      and amortization, partially offset by cost improvements. Slight 
      increases in adjusted EBITDA and margin were attributable to cost 
      savings and price increases which more than offset lower volumes and the 
      negative impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange impacts 
      of $5.5 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $70.1 million grew 9.0 
      percent.

      Slightly lower third quarter net sales were due to temporary operating 
      start-up issues connected with the U.S. distribution center 
      consolidation project which negatively impacted sales by approximately 
      $20 million, along with the planned exit of unprofitable businesses in 
      Mexico which adversely impacted growth by approximately 1.0 percent. 
      Given open orders at the end of the third quarter, solid sales growth 
      resumption is expected in the fourth quarter.
    

      Decreases in third quarter operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins 
      were primarily due to unfavorable product mix.

      The third quarter net sales decline was the result of lower revenues in 
      the U.S. and Europe. European dog and cat food sales declined largely 
      from the acceleration of the planned exit of a pet food customer tolling 
      agreement of $4.7 million. U.S. companion animal sales were negatively 
      impacted by approximately $11 million from the rawhide dog chew product 
      safety recall, as well as sluggish store traffic in certain channels and 
      the planned exits last year of low-margin private label rawhide and 
      chicken jerky business. These planned exits adversely impacted sales by 
      approximately 2.7 percent. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign 
      exchange of $2.7 million and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic 
      net sales decreased 10.5 percent in the third quarter.
    

      Decreased operating income and margin were primarily driven by the 
      impact of the recall and lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA declined as a 
      result of reduced volumes, partially offset by cost savings. Adjusted 
      EBITDA margin improved due to favorable mix and acquisition sales. 
      Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $1.0 million and 
      acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $34.5 
      million fell 8.5 percent.

      Lower third quarter net sales were driven by mass and DIY retailer 
      inventory management programs that negatively impacted sales by 
      approximately $17 million and challenging weather that limited POS and 
      customer orders, as well as strong prior-year repellent orders driven by 
      Zika virus concerns.
    

      Operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins declined in the third 
      quarter predominantly due to lower volumes as well as unfavorable 
      product mix.

      Lower third quarter net sales were attributable largely to mass and auto 
      retailer destocking of approximately $8 million, cooler and wet weather 
      conditions versus last year, and temporary start-up issues at GAC’s new 
      Dayton, Ohio operating facility that adversely affected sales by 
      approximately $4 million.
    

      Reduced operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins in the third 
      quarter were the result of lower volumes and higher marketing 
      investments.
    

Liquidity and Debt


      Spectrum Brands completed its fiscal 2017 third quarter with a solid 
      liquidity position, including a cash balance of approximately $110 
      million and more than $385 million available on its $700 million Cash 
      Flow Revolver.
    

      As of the end of the third quarter, the Company had approximately $4,159 
      million of debt outstanding, consisting of approximately $293 million 
      outstanding on its Cash Flow Revolver, a series of secured Term Loans in 
      the aggregate amount of $1,304 million, $2,306 million of senior 
      unsecured notes, and approximately $256 million of capital leases and 
      other obligations.
    

      During the third quarter, the Company repurchased 487,677 shares of 
      common stock for $62.9 million or $128.92 per share on average.
    

Fiscal 2017 Outlook


      Spectrum Brands expects fiscal 2017 reported net sales to grow above 
      category rates for most categories, along with an anticipated negative 
      impact from foreign exchange of approximately 70 to 90 basis points.
    

      Fiscal 2017 adjusted free cash flow is projected to be approximately 
      $575-$590 million compared to $535 million in fiscal 2016. Capital 
      expenditures are expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 
      million, including rollover spending from fiscal 2016. These incremental 
      investments will support footprint optimization, vertical integration 
      improvements, technology and innovation and are expected to enhance the 
      Company’s margin structure and organic net sales growth rate.

Non-GAAP Measurements


Management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may be 
      useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons 
      between current results and results in prior operating periods. 
      Management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete 
      understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment 
      performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate 
      fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions. In addition, within 
      this release, including the supplemental information attached hereto, 
      reference is made to adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted earnings before 
      interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted 
      EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management to 
      evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial 
      community which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends 
      and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, 
      taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between 
      organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax 
      strategies. Adjusted EBITDA also is one of the measures used for 
      determining the Company’s debt covenant. Adjusted EBITDA excludes 
      certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period 
      to period. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA as a 
      percentage of net sales of the Company. Organic adjusted EBITDA 
      excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and 
      acquisitions. The Company’s management uses adjusted diluted EPS as one 
      means of analyzing the Company’s current and future financial 
      performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and 
      results of operations. Management believes that adjusted diluted 
      EPS is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating 
      performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are 
      not comparable from one period to the next. An income tax 
      adjustment is included in adjusted diluted EPS to exclude the impact of 
      the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax-related 
      items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of 35%.
The Company’s management believes that adjusted free cash flow is 
      useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the 
      Company’s ability to service and repay its debt and meet its working 
      capital requirements. Adjusted free cash flow should not be 
      considered in isolation or as a substitute for pretax income, net 
      income, cash provided by (used in) operating activities or other 
      statement of income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance 
      with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In 
      addition, the calculation of adjusted free cash flow does not reflect 
      cash used to service debt and therefore, does not reflect funds 
      available for investment or discretionary uses. The Company 
      provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, 
      present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the 
      results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management 
      believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, 
      such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP 
      financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP 
      results. Other Supplemental Information has been provided to 
      demonstrate reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements discussed above to 
      most relevant GAAP financial measurements.

      retail customer(s); (12) competitive promotional activity or spending by

      consumer spending preferences and demand for our products; (16) our 
      ability to develop and successfully introduce new products, protect our 
      intellectual property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of 
      third parties; (17) our ability to successfully implement, achieve and 
      sustain manufacturing and distribution cost efficiencies and 
      improvements, and fully realize anticipated cost savings; (18) the cost 
      and effect of unanticipated legal, tax or regulatory proceedings or new 
      laws or regulations (including environmental, public health and consumer 
      protection regulations); (19) public perception regarding the safety of 
      products that we manufacture and sell, including the potential for 
      environmental liabilities, product liability claims, litigation and 
      other claims related to products manufactured by us and third parties; 
      (20) the impact of pending or threatened litigation; (21) the impact of 
      cybersecurity breaches or our actual or perceived failure to protect 
      company and personal data; (22) changes in accounting policies 
      applicable to our business; (23) government regulations; (24) the 
      seasonal nature of sales of certain of our products; (25) the effects of 
      climate change and unusual weather activity; and (26) the effects of

SPECTRUM BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC. OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL 
      INFORMATION (Unaudited)


ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS


      Our press release contains financial information regarding adjusted EPS, 
      which we define as diluted EPS excluding the effect of one-time, 
      non-recurring activity and volatility associated with our income tax 
      expense. The Company believes that adjusted diluted EPS provides further 
      insight and comparability in operating performance as it eliminates the 
      effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the 
      next. Adjustments to diluted EPS include (1) acquisition and integration 
      costs that consist of transaction costs from nonrecurring acquisition 
      transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project 
      costs directly associated with the acquired business further summarized 
      below; (2) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project 
      costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments 
      further summarized below; (3) one time purchase accounting inventory 
      adjustments recognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (4) 
      non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (5) and other 
      adjustments. During the three and nine month periods ended July 2, 2017, 
      other adjustments consist of estimated costs for a non-recurring 
      voluntary recall of rawhide product by the PET segment and professional 
      fees associated with non-acquisition based strategic initiatives of the 
      Company. During the three and nine month periods ended July 3, 2016, 
      other adjustments consisted of costs associated with the onboarding a 
      key executive and the involuntary transfer of inventory. Income tax 
      adjustment to diluted EPS is to exclude the impact of adjusting the 
      valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax related items 
      in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of 35%, net 
      of adjustments made to diluted EPS. The following is a reconciliation of 
      reported diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the three and nine 
      month periods ended July 2, 2017 and July 3, 2016, respectively:

      Our press release contains financial information regarding organic net 
      sales, which we define as net sales excluding the effect of changes in 
      foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions. We believe this 
      non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it 
      reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities 
      without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or 
      acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and 
      evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is 
      calculated by comparing organic net sales to reported net sales in the 
      prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is 
      determined by translating the period’s net sales using the currency 
      exchange rates that were in effect during the prior period. Net sales 
      are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of 
      destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the 
      current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior 
      period. The following is a reconciliation of reported sales to organic 
      sales for the three month period ended July 2, 2017 compared to reported 
      net sales for the three month period ended July 3, 2016, respectively:

SPECTRUM BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC. OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL 
      INFORMATION (Unaudited)


ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, AND ORGANIC ADJUSTED EBITDA


      Our press release contains financial information regarding adjusted 
      EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization), 
      adjusted EBITDA Margin, and organic adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP 
      earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and we believe 
      this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because 
      it reflects ongoing operating performance and trends of our segments 
      excluding certain non-cash based expenses and/or non-recurring items 
      during each of the comparable periods and facilitates comparisons 
      between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation and 
      amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of 
      differing capital structures and tax strategies. Further, adjusted 
      EBITDA is a measure used for determining the Company’s debt covenant. 
      EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company’s income tax expense, 
      interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from 
      intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: 
      (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based 
      compensation cost; (2) acquisition and integration costs that consist of 
      transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period, or 
      subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with 
      the acquired business as previously summarized; (3) restructuring and 
      related costs, which consist of project costs associated with 
      restructuring initiatives as previously summarized; (4) non-cash 
      purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings 
      subsequent to an acquisition; (5) non-cash asset impairments or 
      write-offs realized; (6) and other adjustments. During the three and 
      nine month periods ended July 2, 2017, other adjustments consist of 
      estimated costs for a non-recurring voluntary recall of rawhide product 
      by the PET segment and professional fees associated with non-acquisition 
      based strategic initiatives of the Company. During the three and nine 
      month periods ended July 3, 2016, other adjustments consist of costs 
      associated with onboarding a key executive and the involuntary transfer 
      of inventory. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by taking the 
      adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Net Sales. Organic adjusted 
      EBITDA excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
      and acquisitions. The following is a reconciliation of reported net 
      income to adjusted EBITDA for the three month periods ended July 2, 2017 
      and July 3, 2016, including the calculation of adjusted EBITDA Margin 
      for each of the respective periods, and organic adjusted EBITDA for the 
      three month period ended July 2, 2017:

Providing Affordable Care Products for PetsExpanding on the interaction theme of Companion Animal, ProSense® brand is displaying a range of chews, tablets, shampoos and spray solutions for dental, itch and allergy, and joint health applications. Many of these solutions reflect the products that pet parents also use to maintain their own health. In the ProSense® portion of the booth, pet retailers will gain insights on positioning this line to help them better engage their customers by demonstrating their interest in carrying products geared to help improve the quality of life for their pets. Solving the Pet Hair ProblemEducation is the most important tool in the fight against pet hair.

(SPB), a global consumer products company offering an expanding portfolio of leading brands providing superior value to consumers and customers every day, today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 ended July 2, 2017.This press release includes non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, organic adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. See Other Supplemental Information for reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics.Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Highlights: Net sales of $1.30 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 4.2 percent compared to $1.36 billion last year. Excluding the negative impact of $12.0 million of foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales fell 3.9 percent from the prior year.  Net income of $76.9 million and diluted EPS of $1.31 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased compared to net income of $101.9 million and diluted EPS of $1.71 in fiscal 2016 primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by reduced interest expense.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.71 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 fell 1.2 percent compared to $1.73 last year primarily due to lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by reduced interest expense and lower average shares outstanding.  Operating income of $157.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 23.7 percent compared to $206.7 million in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign exchange, incremental costs of $24.9 million from the Pet division U.S. rawhide safety recall, and additional restructuring costs of $15.7 million, partially offset by lower operating expenses.  Operating income margin of 12.1 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 fell 310 basis points compared to 15.2 percent in the prior year.  Adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 5.5 percent compared to $279.2 million in fiscal 2016. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange of $6.7 million and acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $268.0 million decreased 4.0 percent versus the prior year.  Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.2 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was slightly lower compared to 20.5 percent in fiscal 2016 primarily due to mix and the negative impact of foreign exchange.  Adjusted free cash flow is expected to grow to approximately $575-$590 million versus $535 million in fiscal 2016 and $454 million in fiscal 2015, based on expected net cash provided from operating activities of $680-$695 million after expected purchases of property, plant and equipment of $105-$115 million. “Our third quarter performance is not representative of the positive outlook we have for our growth prospects, strategic direction and efficient global operating model,” said Andreas Rouvé, Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings. “A confluence of factors, some macro and others Company-specific, negatively impacted our results in the quarter.“Systemic U.S. retailer inventory reduction programs and unfavorable early season weather that reduced customer orders and slowed POS predominantly in our seasonal Home & Garden and Global Auto Care businesses impacted sales by approximately $25 million,” Mr. Rouvé said.“At the same time, we experienced temporary, transitional supply chain challenges with our HHI U.S. distribution center consolidation in Kansas and the GAC U.S. operating consolidation in Ohio that affected shipping levels in the short-term and impacted sales by approximately $24 million,” he said. “However, both projects remain on schedule and the issues are being quickly addressed with delayed shipments shifted into our fourth quarter. Despite the start-up challenges, these major consolidation projects will bring a number of important productivity, efficiency and other benefits, including reduced operating costs, lower working capital and even better service to our customers.“In addition, our voluntary safety recall on June 10 of certain U.S. rawhide dog chews affected our Pet sales by approximately $11 million and, as expected, the planned exits of low-margin unprofitable businesses of approximately $10 million also impacted our third quarter revenues as we anniversary last year’s exits throughout fiscal 2017,” Mr. Rouvé said.“On the other hand, we are pleased to report that our e-commerce business was again a bright spot across our entire portfolio with strong, double-digit growth in the third quarter, and we continue to invest more with our retail partners and expand our digital marketing resources especially to drive our innovative and higher-priced products,” he said.“Despite our third quarter shortfall, we remain confident about our growth prospects as we continue to invest into our innovation pipeline and add resources to pursue our many white space opportunities around the world,” Mr. Rouvé said. “We also completed two accretive acquisitions in our Pet business which we are quickly integrating.”Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Consolidated Financial ResultsNet sales of $1.30 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 4.2 percent compared to $1.36 billion in fiscal 2016. Excluding the negative impact of $12.0 million of foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales declined 3.9 percent.Gross profit and gross profit margin in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $473.4 million and 36.3 percent, respectively, compared to $530.6 million and 39.0 percent, respectively, last year. The gross profit margin percentage decrease was primarily due to unfavorable mix, the negative impact of the Pet U.S. rawhide safety recall, increased restructuring-related activities and temporary operating start-up inefficiencies, along with the negative impact of foreign exchange.Operating expenses of $315.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 fell 2.6 percent compared to $323.9 million in the prior year primarily due to lower general and administrative costs.Operating income of $157.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 23.7 percent versus $206.7 million last year as a result of lower volumes, the negative impact of foreign exchange, the unfavorable impact of the Pet U.S. rawhide safety recall and increased restructuring-related activities. Operating income margin of 12.1 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased 310 basis points versus 15.2 percent in 2016.Read MoreNet income was $76.9 million, or $1.31 diluted EPS, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 58.9 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, net income was $101.9 million, or $1.71 diluted EPS, on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.6 million. The decrease in net income and diluted EPS was primarily due to reduced volumes, partially offset by lower interest expense.

In the nine months of fiscal 2016, net income was $268.2 million, or $4.51 diluted EPS, on average shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.5 million.

Organic net sales fell 1.0 percent.Global battery net sales decreased $2.4 million or 1.3 percent. Solid growth in Europe, primarily in alkaline and hearing aid batteries, and in Latin America was offset by lower revenues in the U.S. Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $2.4 million, organic net sales were unchanged.Net sales for the global personal care product category decreased $4.9 million or 4.2 percent. Growth in Latin America was more than offset by lower U.S. and European revenues largely attributable to implemented price increases in Europe, increased competitor promotions and sluggish POS in the U.S. Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $2.3 million, organic net sales declined 2.2 percent.Net sales in the global small appliances product category fell $5.7 million or 3.8 percent. Higher U.S. revenues from growth in e-commerce and mass channels was more than offset by lower sales in Europe and Latin America from a combination of Brexit-related price increases and exits from unprofitable businesses. Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $3.7 million, organic net sales decreased 1.3 percent.The third quarter operating income decrease was due to lower volumes, the negative impact of foreign exchange and slightly higher depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cost improvements. Slight increases in adjusted EBITDA and margin were attributable to cost savings and price increases which more than offset lower volumes and the negative impact of foreign exchange. Excluding foreign exchange impacts of $5.5 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $70.1 million grew 9.0 percent.

Given open orders at the end of the third quarter, solid sales growth resumption is expected in the fourth quarter.Decreases in third quarter operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins were primarily due to unfavorable product mix.

European dog and cat food sales declined largely from the acceleration of the planned exit of a pet food customer tolling agreement of $4.7 million. U.S. companion animal sales were negatively impacted by approximately $11 million from the rawhide dog chew product safety recall, as well as sluggish store traffic in certain channels and the planned exits last year of low-margin private label rawhide and chicken jerky business. These planned exits adversely impacted sales by approximately 2.7 percent. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $2.7 million and acquisition sales of $7.2 million, organic net sales decreased 10.5 percent in the third quarter.Decreased operating income and margin were primarily driven by the impact of the recall and lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA declined as a result of reduced volumes, partially offset by cost savings. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved due to favorable mix and acquisition sales. Excluding negative foreign exchange impacts of $1.0 million and acquisition EBITDA of $2.6 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $34.5 million fell 8.5 percent.

Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million, including rollover spending from fiscal 2016. These incremental investments will support footprint optimization, vertical integration improvements, technology and innovation and are expected to enhance the Company’s margin structure and organic net sales growth rate.Conference Call/Webcast Scheduled for 9:00 A.M.

Management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions. In addition, within this release, including the supplemental information attached hereto, reference is made to adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA also is one of the measures used for determining the Company’s debt covenant. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of the Company. Organic adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The Company’s management uses adjusted diluted EPS as one means of analyzing the Company’s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that adjusted diluted EPS is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. An income tax adjustment is included in adjusted diluted EPS to exclude the impact of the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax-related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of 35%. The Company’s management believes that adjusted free cash flow is useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company’s ability to service and repay its debt and meet its working capital requirements. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for pretax income, net income, cash provided by (used in) operating activities or other statement of income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the calculation of adjusted free cash flow does not reflect cash used to service debt and therefore, does not reflect funds available for investment or discretionary uses. The Company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. Other Supplemental Information has been provided to demonstrate reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements discussed above to most relevant GAAP financial measurements.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain matters discussed in this news release and other oral and written statements by representatives of the Company regarding matters such as the Company’s ability to meet its expectations for its fiscal 2017 (including expectations regarding capital expenditures and its ability to increase its net sales, free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA) may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)ADJUSTED DILUTED EPSOur press release contains financial information regarding adjusted EPS, which we define as diluted EPS excluding the effect of one-time, non-recurring activity and volatility associated with our income tax expense. The Company believes that adjusted diluted EPS provides further insight and comparability in operating performance as it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Adjustments to diluted EPS include (1) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from nonrecurring acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business further summarized below; (2) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments further summarized below; (3) one time purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (4) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (5) and other adjustments. During the three and nine month periods ended July 2, 2017, other adjustments consist of estimated costs for a non-recurring voluntary recall of rawhide product by the PET segment and professional fees associated with non-acquisition based strategic initiatives of the Company. During the three and nine month periods ended July 3, 2016, other adjustments consisted of costs associated with the onboarding a key executive and the involuntary transfer of inventory. Income tax adjustment to diluted EPS is to exclude the impact of adjusting the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of 35%, net of adjustments made to diluted EPS. The following is a reconciliation of reported diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS for the three and nine month periods ended July 2, 2017 and July 3, 2016, respectively:                                          Three Month Periods Ended     Nine Month Period Ended         July 2, 2017     July 3, 2016     July 2, 2017     July 3, 2016     Diluted earnings per share, as reported     $   1.31       $   1.71       $   3.40       $   4.51       Adjustments:                             Acquisition and integration related charges       0.10         0.13         0.25         0.53       Restructuring and related charges       0.36         0.09         0.55         0.14       Debt refinancing costs       0.02         —         0.15         —       Inventory acquisition step-up       0.01         —         0.01         —       Pet safety recall       0.42         —         0.42         —       Other adjustments       0.01         —         0.05         0.02       Income tax adjustment         (0.52   )         (0.20   )         (0.72   )         (1.31   )     Total Adjustments         0.40             0.02             0.71             (0.62   )     Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted     $   1.71         $   1.73         $   4.11         $   3.89                                            The following summarizes the acquisition and integration related charges incurred by the Company for the three and nine month periods ended July 2, 2017 and July 3, 2016:                                          Three Month Periods Ended     Nine Month Period Ended     (in millions)     July 2, 2017     July 3, 2016     July 2, 2017     July 3, 2016     HHI Business     $   1.8     $   4.4     $   5.7     $   12.0     PetMatrix       1.7       —       2.0       —     GloFish       0.8       —       0.8       —     Armored AutoGroup       0.6       2.6       3.0       13.2     Shaser       0.2       —       1.4       —     Other         0.7         1.0         2.1         6.0     Total acquisition and integration related charges     $   5.8     $   8.0     $   15.0     $   31.2                                The following summarizes the restructuring and related charges incurred by the Company for the three and nine month period ended July 2, 2017 and July 3, 2016:                                          Three Month Periods Ended     Nine Month Period Ended     (in millions)     July 2, 2017     July 3, 2016     July 2, 2017     July 3, 2016     GAC business rationalization initiative     $   12.8       $   3.6     $   19.8     $   3.6     HHI distribution center consolidation       9.0         —       9.1       —     PET rightsizing initiative       2.2         —       2.8       —     Other restructuring activities         (2.8   )         1.9         1.0         4.6     Total restructuring and related charges     $   21.2         $   5.5     $   32.7     $   8.2                                  SPECTRUM BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The following information, including the Exhibit 99.1 referenced in this Item
2.02 to the extent the Exhibit discusses financial results of Spectrum Brands
Holdings, Inc. (the "Company" or "Spectrum Brands") for the fiscal third quarter
ended July 2, 2017 is being furnished pursuant to this Item 2.02 and shall not
be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set
forth by specific reference in such filing.
On July 27, 2017, the Company issued a press release (the "Earnings Press
Release") discussing, among other things, its financial results for its fiscal
third quarter ended July 2, 2017. A copy of the Earnings Press Release is
furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this report.



Forward Looking Information



Certain matters discussed in this news release and other oral and written
statements by representatives of the Company regarding matters such as the
Company's ability to meet its expectations for its fiscal 2017 (including
expectations regarding capital expenditures and its ability to increase its net
sales, free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA) may be forward-looking statements
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We
have tried, whenever possible, to identify these statements by using words like
"future," "anticipate", "intend," "plan," "estimate," "believe," "expect,"
"project," "forecast," "could," "would," "should," "will," "may," and similar
expressions of future intent or the negative of such terms. These statements are
subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause results to
differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this release. Actual
results may differ materially as a result of (1) the impact of our indebtedness
on our business, financial condition and results of operations; (2) the impact
of restrictions in our debt instruments on our ability to operate our business,
finance our capital needs or pursue or expand business strategies; (3) any
failure to comply with financial covenants and other provisions and restrictions
of our debt instruments; (4) the impact of actions taken by significant
stockholders; (5) the impact of expenses resulting from the implementation of
new business strategies, divestitures or current and proposed restructuring
activities; (6) our inability to successfully integrate and operate new
acquisitions at the level of financial performance anticipated; (7) the
unanticipated loss of key members of senior management; (8) the impact of
fluctuations in commodity prices, costs or availability of raw materials or
terms and conditions available from suppliers, including suppliers' willingness
to advance credit; (9) interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; (10) our
ability to utilize our net operating loss carry-forwards to offset tax
liabilities from future taxable income; (11) the loss of, significant reduction
in, or dependence upon, sales to any significant retail customer(s); (12)
competitive promotional activity or spending by competitors, or price reductions
by competitors; (13) the introduction of new product features or technological
developments by competitors and/or the development of new competitors or
competitive brands; (14) the effects of general economic conditions, including
inflation, recession or fears of a recession, depression or fears of a
depression, labor costs and stock market volatility or changes in trade,
monetary or fiscal policies in the countries where we do business; (15) changes
in consumer spending preferences and demand for our products; (16) our ability
to develop and successfully introduce new products, protect our intellectual
property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of third parties; (17)
our ability to successfully implement, achieve and sustain manufacturing and
distribution cost efficiencies and improvements, and fully realize anticipated
cost savings; (18) the cost and effect of unanticipated legal, tax or regulatory
proceedings or new laws or regulations (including environmental, public health
and consumer protection regulations); (19) public perception regarding the
safety of products that we manufacture and sell, including the potential for
environmental liabilities, product liability claims, litigation and other claims
related to products manufactured by us and third parties; (20) the impact of
pending or threatened litigation; (21) the impact of cybersecurity breaches or
our actual or perceived failure to protect company and personal data; (22)
changes in accounting policies applicable to our business; (23) government
regulations; (24) the seasonal nature of sales of certain of our products; (25)
the effects of climate change and unusual weather activity; and (26) the effects
of political or economic conditions, terrorist attacks, acts of war or other
unrest in international markets, including those discussed herein and those set
forth in the combined securities filing of Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. and
SB/RH Holdings, LLC, including their most recently filed Annual Report on Form
10-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Spectrum Brands Holdings also cautions the reader that its estimates of trends,
market share, retail consumption of its products and reasons for changes in such
consumption are based solely on limited data available to Spectrum Brands
Holdings and management's reasonable assumptions about market conditions, and
consequently may be inaccurate, or may not reflect significant segments of the
retail market.    Spectrum Brands Holdings also cautions the reader that undue
reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date of this release. Spectrum Brands Holdings undertakes no duty
or responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect
events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect actual
outcomes.
