OUR CORE VALUES

 

Customer Love
We love our customers. When our customers face problems, we empathize with them, treating their problems like our own. We make their problems our problems, and do our best to solve them. We exist because of our customers and for our customers.

 

Positivity
We are positive, glass half-full kind of people. We have fun, celebrate our wins and always look on the bright side. We recognize issues as they arise, address them head-on, learn, and move forward.

 

Integrity
We have integrity. We openly admit when a mistake has been made, learn from it and resolve it. We are metrics driven and own the data that drives our business. We work hard, always do our best, and deliver on our commitments.

 

Gratitude
We are grateful; to our customers, each other, investors and partners.  Gratitude changes how we approach every interaction and is the driving force behind our growth.

 

Dedication
We are dedicated, passionate problem-solvers who get things done. We are dedicated to quality in our product and our interactions. We are calculated, innovative, engaged and actively create opportunities and efficiencies in our business.

 
 
 
 




Stuff That Makes Us AWESOME!

 
 
 



Company Outings
We work hard and we play hard. Whether it’s Lake Day, Top Golf, Snowboarding or just taking the afternoon to see a movie, there’s lots to do in Phoenix, and lots to do at eVisit!

 

Concierge Services
Dry cleaning, auto-detailing and more; if it can be ordered or delivered, you can take care of it at work. While we don’t foot the bill, we do make it easy to get things done from work or from home.

 

Health Insurance
Single? We’ve got you covered. Family? We’ve got their back with a generous plan as well. As a company in the healthcare business, we know the importance of staying healthy.

 

Good Times
We understand. Sometimes you just need to unplug with a game of ping pong, plug in with some Call of Duty, or just pick-up a good book. Go ahead — sit back, pull up a lovesac and take a load off.

 
 


Unlimited Vacation
We know working for a startup takes long hours and hard work. We trust you to get your work done and to take a break to unwind when you need it. We measure output, not desk time.

 

The Best Gear
Having the tools that you feel comfortable with to get the job done is important. So whether you work on a Mac or a PC, need dual monitors or prefer to sit on a bosu ball, we’ve got you covered.

 

All You Can Eat
Snacks galore, drinks to keep you hydrated and team lunches. Working late on a special project? We’ll take care of dinner too. We want you happy, healthy, and well-fed.

 

The Best Team
We’ve got the most dedicated team in health tech. We’re smart, driven and love to have a good time. We hire by committee and love to meet talented, driven people who challenge the status quo.

Comments:  eVisit customer service and IT support are great.  I appreciate how responsive and quick they are at answering my questions and ensuring our success with their platform.  Integration with my practice's EMR was seamless, which was one of our big concerns.  Very easy for the patient to see availability and to schedule an appointment. My patients' feedback has been very positive as well.  Even patients who are far from "tech savvy" have told me they were able to have someone from eVisit support guide them thru the set-up process.  Only occasional hiccups have been on the patients' end (i.e. not having internet connection or camera etc.).  I have not encountered any problems with sending prescriptions or tailoring my calendar/availability.  I was once apprehensive and even a little skeptical when I was asked to research telemedicine options by my employers for a large dermatology practice but eVisit has made the integration simple.

Pros:  eVisit has great customer support for both me as a provider and for my patients.  The interface is user friendly and intuitive.  They are constantly updating their product and adding new features.
Cons:  Not much to dislike here.  As with any IT platform like this, I just want it to work perfectly every time.
Overall:  I started a telemedicine/virtual urgent care company last year and literally spoke with and demo'd at least 8 different companies  before deciding to work with eVisit.  I continue to be very happy with my decision.  While most of these competing companies offer the essentials like  HIPAA compliance, encrypted video, and ePrescribe, I have found the biggest difference with eVisit on the back end.  Let's face it, it's still new technology and there are going to be IT problems.  Some patients and even some providers are going to run into conflicts now and then.  I certainly have.  The difference with eVisit is when I do have an issue and call for support a human answers the phone.  Not only that, it's a knowledgeable person that has been able to solve the problem real time and on the rare occasion that they couldn't,  they put a ticket in that was vigorously addressed the very next day.  My patient's have had the same experience when they have had the need to call and have been personally walked thru the enrollment/set up process.  This has been a huge difference maker in my practice and definitely where you get great value for your money.  
Recommendations to other buyers: I think eVisit is worth a very serious look. While their product is great it's the people behind it that make the difference.  You can talk with them, troubleshoot, and make suggestions that are actively responded to.

Pros:  Nothing  - the website before purchase seems to have good information about telemedicine, so I expected it to be a much more high quality software.
Cons:  Poor function - poor connectivity - missing minor features - silly errors like patients given the wrong date and time for appointment reminders - cannot access prior prescriptions - cannot access patient info from my phone.  Terrible all around.
Overall:  I have been trying for months to get this system to work but have continual problems with basic features.  It is not intuitive, requires involvement with support to make any changes, they make stupid errors like giving out my personal phone number to patients, connectivity is always a problem, and it misses primary needs like being able to find a patient phone number from the app.  Ridiculous.

Telehealth Solutions




Telehealth Solutions
What is Telehealth?
Telehealth solutions come in all shapes and sizes. Telehealth software allows healthcare professionals to deliver health services, education or training, and health information remotely, using telecommunications technology. Unlike telemedicine solutions, which focus more specifically on clinical services, telehealth solutions cover a broader range health services. Health professionals might use a telehealth solution to train healthcare staff, engage and educate patients about a preventative health topic online, or remotely monitor a patient’s recovery after hospital discharge.
The key focus of many of these telehealth software solutions? Leveraging telecommunications technologies to make health and information services more convenient and efficient. And of course, increasing the quality of patient care and raising patient engagement. Telehealth tools can be an incredibly powerful way of making widespread healthcare and health education more accessible – especially to remote parts of the U.S. and the world.
Since telehealth can mean so many different things, there’s an incredible range of telehealth solutions available to physicians and other healthcare providers. In recent years, many healthcare specialties have started applying telecommunications technologies to their preventative, patient education, treatment, and patient monitoring services.
Here are some of the most popular telehealth solutions specialties:

Teleradiology
Telepsychiatry
Teledermatology
Telenephrology
Teleobstetrics
Teleoncology
Teleopthamology
Telepathology
Telerehabilitation

 
What are the different types of telehealth solutions?
Some telehealth providers offer software and other tools across many different specialties, but many focus on a niche specialty or certain mode of telehealth.
What do we mean by mode of telehealth? Well, consider how many different ways there are to share health information and engage with patients, physicians, and other healthcare staff. Here are just a few of the most common types of telehealth solutions:
Store and forward telehealth solutions
Store and forward telehealth technology (sometimes also called “asynchronous telehealth”) allows healthcare professionals to share a patient’s medical images, videos, or health information with a physician at a different location. This allows a medical professional to review a medical case without requiring the patient to be present. It’s also a very commonly used telehealth solution in remote areas, or places with limited specialists available. A secure messaging system is a type of store-and-forward telehealth software.
While store-and-forward telehealth solution are popular with almost all medical specialties, they’re especially common in radiology, dermatology, and ophthalmology. For example, doctors based in small, remote hospitals may send X-rays to radiologists at other locations. It’s also relatively easy for a primary care provider to take a photo of a patient’s skin condition or eyes and forward to a dermatologist or ophthalmologist for quick screenings or further consultation.
Store and forward telehealth is an effective way to boost healthcare efficiency since a physician, patient, and specialist don’t need to be in the same place at the same time. That means lower patient wait times, easy access to specialists (even in places with shortages of providers), and an optimized schedule for the physician, who can review the case when they have time.
Remote patient monitoring
Remote patient monitoring telehealth solutions (sometimes also called “home telehealth” or “telemonitoring”) allow physicians to track a patient’s health from afar. A patient with diabetes, for example, can use a glucose tracker at home to measure levels of glucose and transmit them to their physician. Remote monitoring makes it easy for patients and doctors to stay in constant communication with very little effort or coordination; many remote monitoring telehealth solutions automate the patient’s data transmission process and either send the doctor a regular report, or allow them to “check-in” on the patient on their schedule. Some RPM telehealth software also lets physicians consult with patients remotely via live video.  This means better treatment adherence, less appointments, less emergency visits because of unforeseen problems, and overall better patient outcomes.
Many physicians use remote patient monitoring to follow-up with patients after discharge from a hospital or other care facility.  But RPM telehealth solutions are also becoming an increasingly popular way to monitor high-risk patients and catch problems before patients land in the hospital — especially for those with chronic conditions and patients who have trouble getting to a doctor’s office.
With the rise of wearable technology and mobile medical devices, telehealth providers are starting to offer software and tools that not only connect the patient and physician, but actually capture patients’ medical data. More mobile medical devices come out every day that monitor vital signs, check for ear infections, incorporate ECG sensors, etc. Fitness trackers also get patients engaged in their preventative health and keep physicians updated on things like weight loss, exercise, and general health.
Mobile health solutions
Mobile health refers to healthcare, patient engagement, patient education, and public health programs offered via mobile devices like cell phones, laptops, and tablets. mHealth makes up a huge part of telehealth software solutions, especially since a majority of people now own a smartphone. mHealth solutions usually take the form of mobile apps. They can be as simple as an app that texts patients reminders to take their medications, to a more complex app that connects patients to physicians via live 2-way video (like the eVisit mobile app!). Some mHealth software focuses on educating users about health issues, or better engaging them in their care. As far as telehealth solutions go, mHealth is one of the fast growing and most varied modes of telehealth.
Real-time telehealth
Real-time telehealth (sometimes called “synchronous telehealth”) involves 2-way, live communication between a physician and patient, usually via video. This type is probably what you envision when you hear “telehealth.”  Real-time telehealth solutions are meant to substitute for an in-person doctor-patient visit whenever possible. For example, if a patient suspects s/he has an infection and needs to get quick treatment but cannot get in to see the doctor, s/he could use a real-time telehealth solution to consult his/her doctor remotely and get a necessary prescription. Synchronous telehealth software can also be used for preventative services, or for quick follow-ups after operation or discharge to answer patient questions.
Real-time telehealth providers offer a range of solutions and technology. Some offer entire telehealth “stations” that need to be installed at both the doctor’s office and in the patient’s home or facility (often used in long-term care facilities). Others let patients logon to a secure website from their homes and see a physician contracted by the telehealth company to provide care. The eVisit app, on the other hand, is a real-time telehealth app that connects physicians with their existing patients for preventative care, urgent care, patient education, follow-up checks, and disease management.  Real-time telehealth software like the eVisit app combines the best offerings of telehealth solutions out there – low-cost, well-designed, minimal set-up, and easy-to-use technology that allows for convenient, accessible remote healthcare.
Distance medical consultation and education for providers
Telehealth software isn’t always made for patients. Healthcare providers are increasingly using telehealth solutions for remote consultation and medical education. A top medical specialist based in California could review a patient case with medical students, or a team of providers in Florida to share their expertise. A primary care provider could consult a specialist at another location about a tough patient case through live video. A healthcare provider in the U.S. could share a new medical technique or provide training on a public health issue to a team of doctors in a remote, third-world country via phone or an online conference. The possibilities and telehealth solutions in this case are endless.
About eVisit
The eVisit app is a real-time telehealth solution that allows healthcare to connect with their existing patients via secure, high-resolution, 2-way video. Unlike other telehealth providers, the eVisit app is a physician-first tool built for physicians, by physicians, and was designed to facilitate reimbursement for remote patient visits. An affordable telehealth solution for SMB healthcare providers; scalable for larger healthcare systems. The eVisit app brings convenient, high-quality remote care to patients from their own doctor.

Telehealth Systems




Telehealth Systems
[divider line_type=”No Line” custom_height=”20″]
By this point, you’ve probably heard of telehealth. You know that it involves using telecommunications technology for a range of health services, at a distance. But if you’re a healthcare provider or other health professional who wants to start a telehealth program, you might not know where to start. What kinds of telehealth systems and equipment are required?
Most healthcare professionals and patients already have access to standard telecommunications technology, such as an internet connection, a personal computer, or a telephone. But many telehealth systems available require more than that. Some telehealth providers, for example, require purchase of telemedicine carts, data storage, mobile medical devices, kits, and comprehensive training and support packages.
The best telehealth systems are as intuitive and simple as possible. Here’s an overview of some of the basic elements of many telehealth systems.
Telehealth Kiosks
Telehealth systems used by retail clinics and employers sometimes require installation of a telehealth kiosk. A telehealth kiosk is a small physical booth (think photobooth), usually with a curtain or door for privacy. Each kiosk usually holds a computer, a monitor, a webcam, a microphone, and a variety of mobile medical devices for capturing basic medical data (like blood pressure or heart rate). The idea behind this telehealth system is that patients can go to a convenient location, either at their local drugstore or an on-site at work, and get access to a range of medical specialists. This eliminates the need for patients to purchase or set-up any telemedicine equipment themselves.
Webcams and Digital Cameras
Telehealth used to be practiced via telephone, without any visual medical data. Now, with the accessibility of the internet and high-quality cameras, telehealth systems rely heavily on remotely sharing medical images. Real-time telehealth systems, for instance, require a webcam to connect patients and providers (or providers with a referring specialist) through 2-way video. Some systems might incorporate a simple digital camera that allows patients to take a photo of a rash, and infection, or a skin abnormality and share it securely with their doctor.
Other telehealth systems, especially store-and-forward solutions, depend on high-tech cameras embedded into medical scopes to capture and share high-resolution patient photos.
[thrive_leads id=’6427′]
Telehealth Stations and Carts
Telehealth systems used by larger health systems often require a cart or mobile telehealth station. The mobile carts are often stocked with everything physicians need to video-conference a consulting specialist, capture and share patient medical data, or check-in on a patient at home or in another facility in real-time. Healthcare providers might bring these carts into a patient’s hospital room to connect with another physician during the patient’s exam. In some cases, a patient recovering from hospitalization or suffering a chronic illness at home might have a telehealth cart set-up so that they have all the equipment they need to connect with their physician remotely.
Telehealth Platforms
Telehealth systems always include a digital platform to access, store, share, and secure patient medical data. Some telehealth platforms are software that needs to be installed on a practice or health system’s local server, and can only be accessed on that network. Cloud-based telehealth platforms, on the other hand, live online and can be accessed from any computer or compatible mobile device with the right login information. Many telehealth platforms also now include a mobile app version that lets users logon via their smartphones while on the go.
You should always consider what features and functions are included in a telemedicine platform. Depending on the telehealth system, you might need to purchase several different software packages. For instance, some systems have completely different platforms for real-time telehealth vs. store-and-forward solutions.
Mobile Medical Devices
Mobile medical devices are an important part of many telehealth systems. A physician visiting a patient’s home or working in a very remote area may rely on mobile medical devices to capture, record, and share important patient health information. Patients that are being remotely monitored usually use some type of mobile medical device in the home, whether it’s a glucose tracker, home blood press sure monitor, or portable ECG monitor. Some telehealth systems might connect with a handheld console, that asks patients questions like “how are you feeling today?” and then transmits the patients’ answers to the provider over an internet connection.
Not all telehealth systems require or integrate with mobile medical devices. They’re most important for remote patient monitoring systems, where patient health information needs to be captured outside a standard medical facility.
[thrive_leads id=’6446′]
Selecting the Right Telehealth System for You
The right telehealth system for you depends on many factors: What type of telehealth solution do you need? What can you afford? What will you be using it for?
Watch now: How to Choose the Right Telemedicine Software for Your Practice
Evaluate each telehealth system based on the features and technology it offers. Does it come with a bunch of extra features you don’t need but will be paying for? Is the system overly complicated? Does it require lots of equipment? Don’t forget to consider how much set-up, staff training, and implementation will be required to get the system up and running.
