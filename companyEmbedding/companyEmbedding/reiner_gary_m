Winning the Race for New Product Development

Article excerpt

Winning the Race For New Product Development    The old rules said the lowest-cost supplier won.  To achieve low-cost, businesses used a number of techniques, including low-waged countries, focused factories, technology and economies of scale.  The new game in town today, however, is speed to market.  Why has the game changed?    For one thing, shrinking product life cycles are forcing companies to develop products more quickly to keep up with market needs. Product life cycles are shorter thanks, in part, to improved design technologies, such as computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing, which speed up the development process.  More flexible components have also contributed to the trend by permitting easy variations on a theme, such as semi-custom microprocessors.  Also, aggressive, smart, mostly Asian competitors have stepped up the pace by adopting powerful approaches to new product development.    The machine tool business is a good example of foreign competitors' strength in the new product development race.  James A. D.  Geier, chairman of Cincinnati Milacron, a machine tool manufacturer, noted recently in the Harvard Business Review that "50 percent of the products we sold last year did not even exist five years ago.  We've gone from being an industry with very little change in products to one with a revolutionary change in products." Unfortunately, he laments, the advanced tools are all made in Japan.       SPEEDY COMPUTERS    Houston, Texas-based Compaq Computer Corporation, on the other hand, is a shining example of what can be accomplished on U.S. shores. Compaq, which grew from start-up to Fortune 500 status in less time than any other company, attributes its success to rapid new product development.  Its new product development times are six to nine months, far ahead of the industry's typical 12- to 18-month period.    Compaq was the first to come out with a transportable PC following IBM's desktop PC introduction.  After staying roughly even with IBM on introductions of 286 machines, Compaq leaped ahead of Big Blue with the introduction of a PC based on Intel's more powerful 386 microprocessor.  Compaq worked closely with Intel to ensure compatibility of the 386 chip with existing PC software; once Intel finished redesigning the chip, it took Compaq only one-and-a-half months to introduce the DeskPro 386.    The benefits of faster new product development are obvious, yet too many businesses don't focus on speed as much as they should. Some of the key external benefits include:    * Higher prices (prices typically decline for a given feature over time);    * The opportunity to incorporate the latest available technology into one's product;    * Shorter time horizons, allowing for more accurate customer needs forecasts; and    * Increased market share resulting from the brand advantage associated with being the first to fill customer needs.    Internal benefits are equally important:    * Preventing an already slow development process from becoming even slower, which reduces the chances of frequent market changes prompting management to continually rework the design;    * Accelerating product developers' learning. …

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Exclusive: U.S. weighs financial sanctions to hit Venezuela's oil revenue - sources
                                                


                                                    Reuters –

The United States is considering financial sanctions on Venezuela that would halt dollar payments for the country's oil, according to a senior White House official and an adviser with direct knowledge of the discussions. The move could severely restrict the OPEC nation's crude exports and starve its socialist government of hard currency.

















                                                    Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan to pay $148 million to end yen Libor cases in U.S.

                                                    Weak mortgage income hurts U.S. regional lenders
                                                


                                                    Reuters –

Weak refinancing, thanks to higher interest rates, took a bite out off regional banks' earnings in the second quarter and loan growth remained sluggish, mirroring trends seen at larger banks. Mortgage banking income fell by double digits on a percentage basis at most regional banks that have reported results so far.

















                                                    Bank of America picks Dublin as EU base after Brexit
                                                


                                                    Reuters –

Bank of America (BAC) on Friday became the first Wall Street lender to pick Dublin as its new base for its European Union operations as Britain prepares to leave the bloc. International banks are planning to set up subsidiaries in the EU to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their London operations lose the ability to operate across the bloc once Britain leaves in March 2019.
