Potrero Capital Releases Investor Presentation Outlining Need For Immediate Change At Datawatch

		  Urges Stockholders to Hold Datawatch Board Accountable at Upcoming Annual Meeting

SAN FRANCISCO, March 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Potrero Capital Research, LLC, together with its affiliates ("Potrero Capital"), one of the largest stockholders of Datawatch Corporation ("Datawatch" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:  DWCH) with ownership of approximately 5.6% of Datawatch's outstanding shares of common stock, today announced it has filed a detailed presentation with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") explaining its belief that urgent change is needed to Datawatch's Board of Directors (the "Board").
In the presentation, Potrero Capital explained its views regarding why immediate change is necessary to the Board, including the Company's repeated underperformance of the market and its peer group, the mismanagement and failed execution the Company has suffered from under its current leadership and the poor corporate governance of the Company that Potrero Capital believes is eroding stockholder value. Potrero Capital intends to solicit support to "withhold" votes from Datawatch's incumbent directors at the Company's upcoming 2016 annual meeting of stockholders to send a clear message that it is time for change at Datawatch.
Potrero Capital's presentation is available on the SEC's website and can be viewed by clicking the following link: http://tinyurl.com/DWCH-Presentation-Potrero
