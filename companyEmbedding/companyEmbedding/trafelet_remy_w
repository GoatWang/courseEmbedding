Remy Trafelet Reopens Hedge Fund After 5 Years


2/26/2014

Remy Trafelet Reopens Hedge Fund After 5 Years
If the name Remy Trafelet seems familiar, you might remember him and his fund Trafelet Capital Management, a multi-billion dollar long/short fund founded in 1999. Before that, he became one of the youngest portfolio managers in Fidelity’s history. He started managing Trafelet by the age of 25. Now, an older, more selective Trafelet is back with a slimmed down product offering and a focus on doing what he does best - pick stocks.
"I've spent the last five years simplifying the business, so I can get back to what I love doing which is focusing on stock picking. So now it's me and a handful of analysts," Trafelet says in an interview with Opalesque.
At its height, Trafelet Capital had US, European, and global focused funds, along with some ancillary services. Then 2008 hit, and much of the firms assets came directly from big bank balance sheets. Once they started unravelling, Trafelet didn't put up gates. Instead, he gave the banks the money they put in and started trimming the fat. At that time and until just this month, the fund was closed to new investors. Now, with a new senior partner in place and a clearer focus he's opening it up, but not to just anyone. "Going forward we want to be more selective with investors and make sure our interests are aligned," he says.
Unlike a number of managers faced with steep competition for asset gathering, Trafelet doesn't necessarily need to raise a lot of capital to stay afloat. Instead, he says, he wants to focus on doing what he loves and letting investors in that share his views of the market. These new investors are likely to be less risky than the bulge brackets he had before. He's already seen his first commitment.
In addition to refocusing the fund, Trafelet brought on George Brokaw as a senior partner who will handle more of the investor relations work. Brokaw was previously a managing director at Highbridge Capital Management. The new version of the firm will be called Trafelet Brokaw & Co., and will still focus on Trafelet's proven strategy of long term investments.
He explains that with the help of his analysts, they'll look at a significant number of companies in a given year but from that only draw 2-3 big ideas. All of those ideas are centered on US companies. Sometimes, between them they'll see 3-4 companies a day - that includes site visits and meetings with management. The team is market cap agnostic and almost industry agnostic, "we're not looking at biotech, pharma, we're looking more at solid companies with a good story."
"We're really focused on companies where we'd like to own the whole company if we could. We like ideas where there is good cash flow and we're getting all of our money back in say three years," he says pointing to the Tribune companies as a recent idea. "We're basically getting the cable asset for free there." They'll also look at complex companies that require some significant financial modeling, restructures, turnarounds, almost a private equity look - more than the average balance sheet calculator. "Not all of the companies we look at have a lot of coverage, but we'll do the work."
Right now, Trafelet is more or less in his sweet spot. He says he has no plans to return to the sprawling asset management style outfit he had before the crisis - he'd rather spend the time looking at companies. When asked where he sees the firm headed, he said - "Instead of thinking five years out I'd rather think 15 years out and keep posting compounded returns." The fund has returned just over 12% per year since inception.
