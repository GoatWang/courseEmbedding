WILDER, Idaho--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CTI Foods, a leading custom foodservice manufacturer supplying the top 
      U.S. restaurant chains and branded food companies, announced today the 
      appointment of Raymond (Ray) Silcock as Executive Vice President and 
      Chief Financial Officer, effective June 6. Silcock was most recently CFO 
      at Diamond Foods. He will be based in Wilder and will report directly to 
      Sam Rovit, President and Chief Executive Officer.
    


      “I am extremely pleased at the opportunity to partner with Ray again,” 
      said Sam. “We worked together at Swift & Company ten years ago and I’ve 
      followed his career successes closely ever since. We are fortunate to 
      add someone to the CTI leadership team with his breadth and depth of 
      experience.”
    

      “Having spent most of my career in the food sector,” said Ray, “what 
      attracts me to CTI is the opportunity to create a true industry leader. 
      At $1.5B, CTI is one of the largest suppliers in a fragmented market and 
      I see great potential here for M&A, as well as for innovation-driven 
      growth with new and existing customers.”
    

      As CFO, Ray will be responsible for providing financial counsel and 
      business insight on all strategic and operational issues. He will work 
      closely with the senior leadership team to develop the company’s 
      strategic plan and key business initiatives, as well as take 
      responsibility for all financial matters.
    

      Most recently, Ray led the global Finance and Accounting organization of 
      Diamond Foods, Inc. where, as EVP and Chief Financial Officer, he helped 
      successfully lead the sale of the business to Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. 
      earlier this year.
    

      Prior to joining Diamond, Ray was SVP & CFO of The Great Atlantic & 
      Pacific Tea Company, guiding the company out of bankruptcy. Other roles 
      have included serving as CFO of UST Inc. and CFO of Swift and Company.
    

      From 1998 until 2005, Ray was CFO of Cott Corporation, where he oversaw 
      a complete restructuring and turnaround of that business. Earlier in his 
      career, he held a variety of progressively more responsible roles at 
      Campbell Soup Company where he worked from 1979-1997.
    

      Ray is a member of the Board of Directors of Pinnacle Foods Inc. and an 
      Advisory Partner for Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity company. 
      He holds an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of 
      Pennsylvania and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Cost & 
      Management Accountants.
    

      CTI Foods, headquartered in Wilder, Idaho, was founded in 1984. The 
      company’s product range includes fresh and cooked protein, beans, tacos, 
      pepperoni, soups and sauces made at seven plants across the U.S.
    

      CTI is owned in majority by Thomas H. Lee Partners and Goldman Sachs & 
      Co.

NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Home-building company KB Home

                                         which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Raymond P. Silcock left the company on December 14. William R. Hollinger, who has served as senior vice president and chief accounting officer since 2007, will be the company's principal financial officer, pending the selection of a new CFO. Silcock will receive a lump-sum payment of $200,000 and six months of salary, or an aggregate of $300,000, according to a filing with the SEC. The company provided no reason for Silcock's leaving. NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Home-builder KB Home KBH, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosed late Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Raymond P. Silcock left the company Monday. The Los Angeles-based company, the nation's fifth-largest builder by annual closings, provided no reason for Silcock's departure, which was mutual. Representatives weren't immediately available for comment. William R. Hollinger, who has served as senior vice president and chief accounting officer since 2007, becomes principal financial officer, pending the selection of a new CFO. Silcock will receive a lump-sum payment of $200,000--the bonus he was guaranteed in connection with his hire--and six months of salary, or an aggregate of $300,000, according to a filing with the SEC. This news follows the October disclosure that the SEC issued a "formal order of investigation . . . regarding possible accounting and disclosure issues." The exact reason remains unclear: A spokeswoman had no further detail earlier Thursday. In recent years, KB Home also has been rocked by scandals over manipulation of stock options paid to its chief executive and by federal charges that it engaged in improper mortgage lending. In November 2006, Bruce Karatz resigned as chief executive of KB after an internal investigation found he backdated his own stock option grants to increase his pay. In September 2008, Karatz agreed to pay more than $7 million to settle securities charges with the SEC but didn't admit any wrongdoing in the backdating case. His lawyer, John Keker, said then that Karatz acted "appropriately." In mid-2005, KB agreed to pay $3.2 million to settle federal allegations that its mortgage unit engaged in poor practices. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development charged that a KB subsidiary made it possible for ineligible borrowers to get mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. Like other home builders, KB has suffered heavy losses in recent years amid plunging demand and the need to write down the value of land. KB reported a net loss of $66 million for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with a year-earlier loss of $144.7 million. It is scheduled to report results for its fourth quarter Jan. 12. Shares of KB Home were up slightly after hours at $13.32. NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Home-builder KB Home KBH, which is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosed late Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Raymond P. Silcock left the company Monday after about three months. The Los Angeles-based company, the nation's fifth-largest builder by annual closings, provided no reason for Silcock's departure, saying in a statement that the two parties "mutually agreed to conclude his employment." Representatives weren't immediately available for further comment. William R. Hollinger, who has served as senior vice president and chief accounting officer since 2007, becomes principal financial officer, pending the selection of a new CFO. Silcock was a recent arrival at KB Home, having joined in September. Previously, he served as CFO of UST Inc., a consumer products concern. From KB Home, Silcock will receive a lump-sum payment of $200,000--the bonus he was guaranteed in connection with his hire--and six months of salary, or an aggregate of $300,000, according to a filing with the SEC.

Stocks brace for volatility in earnings deluge; Fed meeting looms
              
              With nearly a fifth of earnings reports out, investors are divided on how early corporate reports are serving as an indicator of the overall health of the U.S. economy, and that could contribute to a volatile week as stocks linger near record highs.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks
