INTRODUCTION TO OUR COMPANY
Platinum Capital Investment Partners LP (“PCIP” or the “Fund” or the “Company”) a California limited partnership was formed for the purpose of investing primarily in commercial buildings and cannabis orientated businesses to achieve above average returns for investors.  Focusing on the purchase of quality commercial real estate that can lease to operators within the cannabis industry or other industries that pay higher return lease rates. Platinum Capital Partners GP LLC (the “General Partner” or the “GP”) believes that cannabis investment is an attractive asset class with substantial growth potential.  PCIP has been established to exploit a particularly attractive niche opportunity within the cannabis industry and undervalued real estate.
The Fund will purchase commercial buildings that the General Partner believes will yield at least an 18% annualized return based on the potential leases, and for cash flow and appreciation.  PCIP will also invest in companies where the return has a potential yield of at least 20%. The Fund is targeting investment returns to investors of 15%-25% per annum. This return includes both ongoing cash flow from operations as well as appreciation and amortization of debt.

	grow to a $6.4 billion market by 2020, when

The Sacramento region can produce
	more than 700 marijuana industry jobs,
	1,100 related jobs and $386 million in total
	economic impact if the pot trade grows
	only marginally beyond the current medical
	marijuana economy.
— Jeffrey Michael and Thomas Pogue said in a University of the Pacific
	study. —




According to a recent Gallup poll, public
	support for legal pot has climbed to 60
	percent — the highest level recorded by

Globally, $150 billion was spent last year on
	marijuana.

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS
Platinum Capital Investment Partners LP (“PCIP” or the “Fund” or the “Company”) a California limited partnership was formed for the purpose of acquiring real estate that seeks to produce superior risk-adjusted returns over a long period of time by investing in real estate suited for use by uniquely situated tenants who are able to pay premium rental rates.  Strategic investments in cannabis companies may be made by the Company as well.  Platinum Capital Partners GP LLC (the “General Partner” or the “GP”) believes that cannabis investment is an attractive asset class with substantial growth potential.  Platinum Capital Investment Partners LP has been established to exploit a particularly attractive niche opportunity within the cannabis industry as it relates to real estate.
PCIP’s investment objective is to provide investors with an above average rate of return on both an absolute as well as risk adjusted basis, with a focus on delivering long term appreciation and potentially annual cash flow.  The Fund will purchase commercial buildings that the General Partner believes will yield at least an 18% annualized return based on the potential leases, and for cash flow and appreciation.  PCIP will also invest in companies where the return has a potential yield of at least 20%. The Fund is targeting investment returns to investors of 15%-25% per annum. This return includes both ongoing cash flow from operations as well as appreciation and amortization of debt. It is expressed net of any General Partner related fees but before any income taxes to be paid by the investors.  The majority of the Fund’s target return is based on the ability to purchase property below market. However, no assurances can be given that PCIP’s target yields, appreciation rates or costs as described in this Memorandum will be attained
