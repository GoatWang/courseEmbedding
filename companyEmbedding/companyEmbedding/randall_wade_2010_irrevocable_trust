However, you may have some questions about how the estate planning process works.
Key estate planning terms to know
As you embark on the estate planning process, you're likely to come across some unfamiliar terms. The following list isn't a complete glossary, but it will give you a good understanding of the most common terms.

Estate: Everything you own. This includes your home, business, vehicles, and jewelry, but also takes  smaller items into account.
Estate planning: The process of making arrangements for your estate if you die or become incapacitated. Living wills, last wills, and trusts may all be part of your estate plan.
Wills: There are two types of wills. Last wills give instructions for your estate after your death. A living will outlines your wishes for medical care if you become unable to make decisions.
Trusts: Trusts can take several different forms. Most people use trusts to minimize estate taxes and avoid probate. A trust is often similar to a will in that it gives instructions for the care of your belongings, but a trust can go into effect while you are still alive.
Estate tax: A tax on your belongings after your death. However, estate taxes are really only a concern for wealthy individuals. For 2015, estates worth less than $5,430,000 do not require the people who inherit them to file an estate tax return.
Probate: The process of validating a last will. The person you appoint as the will's executor is responsible for making sure that your wishes are carried out. The executor may have to gather documentation proving the value of your estate.

What an estate plan involves
Your estate plan should be as complete as possible. Three things to make sure you address are end of life care, inheritances, and life insurance.

End of life care: Arrangements for end of life care should be included in your estate plan. Having a living will is essential for this. You may also want to talk to local funeral homes and crematoriums so you can make arrangements for your remains.
Inheritance: Carefully consider who you would like to have inherit your possessions, and make sure to follow state law when doing so. Each state has its own unique laws on estate planning. If you do not complete all the necessary paperwork, your property may go to places other than where you intended.
Life insurance: Having insurance may help your heirs cover the estate tax if it is a factor. Otherwise, it will help to pay off your final debts and may provide a financial cushion for your loved ones.

When to hire an estate planning lawyer
You may be able to take care of estate planning without the help of a legal professional. There are even online legal documents that a court may find acceptable.
However, you should at least talk to an attorney about your estate plan. Lawyers are familiar with local regulations. They can look over your documents to make sure that you haven't missed any important details.
Hiring a lawyer is particularly important if you wish to set up a trust. Because there are so many different types of trusts, you will need guidance on which type is the most appropriate for your situation. A lawyer can also advise you on how to change the terms of a trust or a will if it becomes necessary.
Why you should have an estate plan
Your estate includes everything you own. In other words, everyone who owns something has an estate. Even if you aren't wealthy, an estate plan can give you and your loved ones peace of mind.Featured articlesWillsWhy a Basic Will is Not EnoughAttorney Tamara HarperDo I need a will?

Our services help you solve legal issues, learn more about your legal situation, and navigate the legal process—all with ease.Your  guide to online legal researchIt's tough to know where to start when you're researching legal questions. With this guide, you'll be able to define your legal issue, research it, and get the help you need.Step 1: define your legal issueWhen you're just getting started, there are a few things to figure out about your legal issue—like, is it a criminal or civil case? Which laws apply—municipal, state, federal? And, what area of the law represents your issue? Once you have answers to these questions, you can start researching and learning about possible outcomes and next steps.Is this a true legal issue?First you need to determine whether you have a legal issue or simply a problem. Maybe you don't like your downstairs neighbor playing loud music during the day. But, if they're not breaking any laws, what you have is a personal matter, not a legal one.A legal problem is one that can be solved by using the law. It's an issue that's addressed within federal, state, or municipal laws and regulations.Can I sue?If you've determined that your problem is a legal one, you might be wondering if you can sue. While in theory you can pretty much sue anyone for anything, the reality is that doing so is often a waste of time and money. It's always a good idea to consult with an attorney to determine whether you can take your suit to court. You might consider mediation or arbitration first.The question should not be “Can I sue?” but “Should I sue?”Consider the following:Do you have a written contract with the party you want to sue? If you don't have a written contract, do you believe you had a clear agreement, even if it wasn't written down?Can you demonstrate that the party you want to sue violated their part of the agreement? Can you demonstrate that you held up your end?Do you think you have a good chance of winning?Is this a good use of your time and resources? Weigh the cons, like time, money, and stress against the possible pros, like justice and compensation. It's also worth determining if the party you're sueing has enough money to pay your claim.Is this a criminal matter or a civil matter?There are two main types of legal issues: criminal matters and civil matters. In criminal cases, the government prosecutes the case. In civil cases, the person bringing the suit hires an attorney to prosecute. If you've been arrested, you're looking at a criminal matter, but depending on the circumstances, it could be a civil matter as well.Civil lawsuits are easier to win because the burden of proof is lower. And it's not necessarily one or the other. There can be a criminal case and a civil case for the same matter. If you're considering whether or not to sue someone, or you have been sued, you're looking at a civil matter.There are two main types of legal issues: criminal matters and civil matters.What about municipal, state, and federal laws?Federal, state, and local governments each have their own sets of laws. Your legal issue will likely fall under one of these three categories. Depending on your issue, you may want to research all three.For any legal issue, make sure you do it in the correct court and consult with an attorney to figure out which court to file in.What practice area does it fall under?The best way to research your legal issue is to start by identifying the broad category that it falls under. You may have noticed that lawyers almost always associate themselves with “practice areas.” These are the areas they have particular experience and knowledge in. Common practice areas include, but are not limited to,  corporate law, criminal law, estate planning, employment law, personal injury, and business law. You probably wouldn't want to talk to a heart surgeon about a sprained ankle, and similarly, you probably don't want an attorney in criminal law to handle a divorce.Finding the most relevant practice area can be tricky. For instance, you know that your issue is about medical malpractice, but you may not know that it falls under the category of personal injury law. Or maybe you're in the middle of a situation—like, you've asked your landlord to add a disabled parking spot outside your building, and your landlord has refused. You could be looking into three separate topics: tenant/landlord laws, discrimination, and civil rights.If you still aren’t sure how to categorize your issue, you can ask a question about it or read recently asked questions on Avvo’s free Q&A forum.Step 2: research your legal issueOnce you've defined your legal issue, you can start researching online. It's helpful to begin by breaking down all the facts—this process will help you identify some important keywords that you can use to kick off your research.What are the facts?When researching a legal issue, many attorneys get to the facts of the case by using a common legal research method called TARP, which stands for thing, cause of action, relief sought, person/parties involved. You can do the same. TThingACause of ActionRRelief SoughtPPerson/Parties InvolvedStart with the thing. What's the subject matter? It could be one thing, for example—a divorce. Or it could be a couple things like divorce plus child custody.Then look at the cause of action. That is, how were you wronged under the law? This may be an issue like negligence, breach of contract, fraud, or slander.Next is relief sought. Relief could be monetary compensation for covering costs associated with the issue or for pain and suffering. Or it could be to prevent the defendant from engaging in certain behavior again.Finally, person/parties involved. Who are the players? What are their roles? What are their relationships to each other? For example: employer-employee; father-son; or neighbor-neighbor.Now that you know what kind of issue you have, what category it falls under, and what the basic facts are, you're ready to begin solving your legal puzzle.How do I research my legal issue online?Here are step-by-step instructions to researching online.Start with Avvo. You'll find plenty of free legal advice in Avvo's guides with information on over 1,000 legal topics and over 7 million questions and answers. Just remember that laws can vary significantly from state to state. When researching online, don't rely on information about another state's laws, as it may not be relevant to your situation.Look up your local court system. Simply search Google for “[your city] court.” This is often the place to get information on traffic court and family court in your area. You can also get info on state and federal courts at USCourts.gov.Learn more from your local Bar association. Search Google for your state or county Bar association. The association's website will often have resources for the public.Dig into the laws themselves. The Legal Information Institute at Cornell has laws organized by location and topic, plus online legal advice to help you interpret them. Also try searching “[your state] laws,” as your state will have local resources.If you get stuck, you can quickly check with an attorney to explain what you've found.Step 3: resolve your issueResolution can come in many forms—after doing your research, you may decide to handle it yourself or decide that it's not worth pursuing. Or, you may seek additional clarification or legal advice before making a move. Or, you may be convinced that you need to hire a lawyer right away. The main thing to know is that you have options.Can I do it myself?If you want to do it yourself (DIY), it's your right to be your own representative in legal matters. This is called pro se legal representation, from the Latin meaning “for oneself.” It's fairly common in uncontested divorces and in small claims courts (especially in states that prohibit lawyers in small claims court).In certain matters, attorneys are required by law, whether you want one or not. In most cases, it's a good idea to get some input from a lawyer regardless.The fact is, you don't know what you don't know, and that's ok. Speaking with an attorney—even just for a quick consultation—could give you insight into how to move forward and peace of mind.If you want to forge ahead and handle your legal issue yourself, do your research and come up with a plan. If you want to talk to an attorney, some offer free consultations, but these sessions are usually used as a way to get to know each other and talk about whether you have a case. If you want quick legal advice, you can always get on the phone with a lawyer with Avvo Advisor—it's a 15-minute conversation with a lawyer for $39.If I hire a lawyer, what can I expect?When you hire a lawyer, you're hiring someone to represent you. Depending on your issue, your lawyer may represent you in litigation (in court) or in mediation/arbitration proceedings. Or they may create, review, process, or file documents.Even more importantly, your lawyer will give you advice, proactively work for your interests, and anticipate problems that you may not see coming.Many attorneys provide free consultations to new clients to see if there's a good fit between need and expertise.When you decide to hire an attorney, do your due diligence and take a look at Avvo's guide to finding and hiring a great lawyer.This may all sound overwhelming, but with a little work you'll have a better understanding of what to do and how to take action. You've got this!Set LocationCity and stateCancelSave

Pleasant Hill, CA | September 14, 2010Rev. Trust was setup by WESI Family of Comanies/American Family Legal Centers now called the Estate Services Group/Michael Fisher. He is being sued by the other party claiming to represent our trust: United Integrity Group. They transferred our trust to Puritan Life Insurance Services. Michael Fisher claims he still handles the trust. Originally when we opened the trust for aprox $900, we were told we would have lifetime free changes annually, and reviews. We are now told there is a $150 charge for changes.  Our income is reduced, and I am currently working for my spouse and seeking employment. Should we takeover handling our trust ourselves?  Do we need to file any legal papers to do so? I am so overwhelmed with this mess. Thank you!

You can pick any attorney you like and have them help you with changes, if you believe that changes are necessary.
It sounds like you might have purchased an annuity or other financial product and that the two companies are claiming to own the product - i.e. they are the company you pay premiums to.  If that's the case, then you are in a bit of a pickle.  You might still need a lawyer to help sort things out, but you might also want to contact the state insurance commissioner, too.
I know you said that you are on a low income, but you are swimming in dangerous waters having important legal documents prepared by non-attorneys who also sell financial products for a commission.  Many of these outfits are looking to use low-price trusts as a way to get your financial information and try to sell you expensive financial products that pay them high commissions.
As an analogy, it's like the difference between having your car repaired by your local dealership versus hiring a guy you meet in front of the local car parts store.  There are some halfway decent (as in your house won't explode instantly) document preparers out there.  But, I would venture to guess that none of the decent ones sell financial products, too.  That's an instant sign that you're dealing with a scam artist.
As far as your trust goes, you should have it looked at as soon as you can afford a lawyer.  If there is a financial product involved, you might want to talk to the insurance commissioner.

A revocable trust is a trust that can be amended or revoked by the grantor of the trust at any time.  Typically the grantor of the revocable trust also serves as the Trustee and a successor Trustee is named within the document.  If you are unhappy with the service which is being provided to you, you have the option to amend the trust and name new trustees.  No attorney or corporation has ownership over your trust.Ask a similar questionMore 0 found this answer helpfulhelpful votes Mark as helpfulHelpful0  comments Similar questionsI'm a resident of WA but own real estate in CA.

 3 Things To Know Before Setting Up An Irrevocable Trust | How To Protect Your Assets            How To Protect Your Assets Menu       3 Things To Know Before Setting Up An Irrevocable Trust Thinking about setting up an irrevocable trust? When it comes to setting up a trust, many don’t realize the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust. Before you sign on the dotted line, there are a few things you should know about irrevocable trusts.   You Give Up Your Rights with Irrevocable TrustsTo distinguish the key differences between a revocable and irrevocable trust, the name says it all. Once you set up a revocable trust, it’s not set in stone. Trustees can make changes to the trust during their lifetime at their discretion. If you change your mind about leaving your home and a million dollars to your ungrateful son, you can remove his name as beneficiary.With an irrevocable trust, once the grantor does the initial setup, the trustee takes over. That means you can’t go back and rewrite or remove the terms of the trust. Even if there is an exception, the trustee and all parties involved would have to agree to the changes. Even the beneficiaries would need to agree. That’s a hard pill to swallow about assets you once owned.Irrevocable Trusts Are Beneficial Tools for Estate PlanningYou might be wondering why you’d want to get involved in a trust that’s so final. Irrevocable trusts have some nice tax benefits for estate purposes. You’re able to place some property within the trust to reduce the taxable value. Some assets are also sheltered from estate taxes at the time of the grantor’s death and distribution.   There are some other pros to no longer having ownership of assets in an irrevocable trust. In the event of issues with creditors, it protects your estate. Since the assets belong to the trustee after setup, creditors can’t seize assets to reconcile outstanding debts. Even in the case of a bankruptcy, the assets will stay put in the irrevocable trust.Irrevocable Trusts Require MaintenanceIt may not be as simple as you think to setup an irrevocable trust. The process is more than just a one-time setup. Irrevocable trusts require upfront and continuous fees for maintenance and to pay staff. The least expensive trust will cost a few thousand dollars to setup. You’ll also have to pay a trust attorney to make sure the trust is organized correctly with the most benefits.Deciding whether to set up an irrevocable trust all boils down to what you need it to do for you. In the end, even revocable trusts transition to irrevocable. After the death of the grantor, no one can make changes to the terms. The decision depends on if you want to have control and flexibility during your lifetime or the tax benefits to work for everyone now and later.
