Material Instances of Noncompliance by National Tax Search, LLC



1122(d)(2)(vii): Reconciliations are prepared on a monthly basis for all
asset-backed securities related to bank accounts, including custodial accounts
and related clearing accounts. These reconciliations (B) Are prepared within 30
calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date, or such other number of days
specificied in the transaction agreement and (D) Contain explanations for
reconciling items. These reconciling items are resolved within 90 calendar days
of their original identification, or such other number of days specificied in
transaction agreements.


Noncompliance

During the reporting period, certain reconciliations were not completed within
30 calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date. Certain reconciling items
lacked proper explanations and were not resolved within 90 day calendar days of
their original identification.


Remediation

Management corrected the timeliness of reconciliations within the Period and
Plante Moran auditors have reviewed, under an agreed-upon procedures engagement,
the compliance with the servicing criteria of section 1122(d)(2)(vii),
attributes B & D, as defined above, as of January 31, 2014, noting no matters of
concern.


In the first quarter of 2014 Management will also complete installation of a
Treasury Workstation system, which allows for the automation of daily
reconciliation allowing for review and research throughout the month instead of
the days after a bank statement cutoff date. This daily reconciliation will be
accompanied by proper explanation of all reconciling items. Management will
review any items that require resolution and reporting will provide aging of
items at 30, 45 and 60 day levels to prevent exceeding the 90 calendar day
requirement.

Report on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria



Midland Loan Services ("Midland"), a division of PNC Bank, National Association,
is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122 (d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("Regulation AB"), as set forth in Appendix A hereto, relating to its
role in the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions.


Midland has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2013 (the "Reporting Period"). In making
this assessment, Midland used the criteria set forth by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB. This report covers
the commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions (the "Platform").


Midland engaged certain vendors, which are not servicers as defined in item
1101(j) of Regulation AB (the "Vendors"), to perform specific, limited or
scripted activities related to portions of the servicing criteria as set forth
in Appendix A. Midland elects to take responsibility for assessing compliance
with the servicing criteria or portion of the servicing criteria applicable to
such Vendors' activities as set forth in Appendix A. Midland has not identified
and is not aware of any material instances of noncompliance by the Vendors with
the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2013 and for the Reporting
Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole, nor has it identified any
material deficiencies in its policies and procedures to monitor the compliance
by the Vendors with the applicable servicing criteria as of December 31, 2013
and for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform taken as a whole.


Based on this assessment, Midland believes that, as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013, Midland has complied in all material respects with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB relating to its
role in the servicing of commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions.


PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
has issued an attestation report on Midland's assessment of compliance with the

REPORT ON ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION'S REGULATION AB SERVICING CRITERIA



For the calendar year ending December 31, 2013, National Tax Search, LLC has
been a Tax Service Vendor for Wells Fargo Bank (the "Servicer").


National Tax Search, LLC ("NTS") is responsible for assessing compliance as of
December 31, 2013 and for the period from January 1, 2013 through December 31,
2013 (the "Reporting Period") with the servicing criteria set forth in Title 17,

Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of Federal Regulations (the "CFR"). NTS has used
the servicing criteria communicated to NTS by the Servicer to assess compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria. Only servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii),
1122(d)1(iv), 1122(d)2(ii), 1122(d)2(v), 1122(d)2(vi), 1122(d)2(vii),
1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii) (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria") are
applicable to the activities NTS performs with respect to the transactions
covered by this report. NTS has determined that the remaining servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the SEC Regulation AB are not applicable to the
activities it performs with respect to the transactions covered by this report.
The transactions covered by this report include all tax payments made on behalf
of the Servicer using NTS's TaxQ system (the "Platform Transactions").


NTS, as a vendor, has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing
Criteria for the Reporting Period and has concluded that the NTS has complied,
in all material respects, with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of December
31, 2013 and for the Reporting Period with respect to the Platform Transactions
taken as a whole, except as described in Schedule A.


Plante & Moran, PLLC, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
issued an attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria as of December 31, 2013 and for the Reporting Period as set
forth in this assertion.

Schedule A




Material Instances of Noncompliance by the Company



1122(d)(2)(vii): Reconciliations are prepared on a monthly basis for all
asset-backed securities related to bank accounts, including custodial accounts
and related clearing accounts. These reconciliations (B) Are prepared within 30
calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date, or such other number of days
specificied in the transaction agreement and (D) Contain explanations for
reconciling items. These reconciling items are resolved within 90 calendar days
of their original identification, or such other number of days specificied in
transaction agreements.


Noncompliance

During the reporting period, certain reconciliations were not completed within
30 calendar days after the bank statement cutoff date. Certain reconciling items
lacked proper explanations and were not resolved within 90 day calendar days of
their original identification.


Remediation

Management corrected the timeliness of reconciliations within the Period and
Plante Moran auditors have reviewed, under an agreed-upon procedures engagement,
the compliance with the servicing criteria of section 1122(d)(2)(vii),
attributes B & D, as defined above, as of January 31, 2014, noting no matters of
concern.


In the first quarter of 2014 Management will also complete installation of a
Treasury Workstation system, which allows for the automation of daily
reconciliation allowing for review and research throughout the month instead of
the days after a bank statement cutoff date. This daily reconciliation will be
accompanied by proper explanation of all reconciling items. Management will
review any items that require resolution and reporting will provide aging of
items at 30, 45 and 60 day levels to prevent exceeding the 90 calendar day
requirement.

Management's Report on Assessment of 2013 Compliance by Pentalpha
Surveillance, LLC With Regulation AB Servicing Criteria


Pentalpha Surveillance, LLC (the Asserting Party) is responsible for assessing
its compliance, as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013, with the
servicing criteria set forth in Title 17, Section 229.1122(d) of the Code of
Federal Regulations.


The assessment concerns the Asserting Party's servicing efforts for its
servicing "Platform," which consists of its servicing activities encompassed by
contractual obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (see the Exhibit for
a list of the Asserting Party's Platform of required reporting by the servicing
agreements).


The Asserting Party has assessed its compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Asserting Party
used the criteria in Paragraph (d) of Section 1122 of Regulation AB
(17 C.F.R. 229.1122) to assess its compliance.


Based on such assessment, the Asserting Party believes that as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2013, the Asserting Party has complied in all material
respects with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB
relating to its operational advisor role in the servicing of the Platform,
except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i-iv), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii),
1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi) and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv), which the Asserting
Party has determined as being inapplicable to the activities it performs with
respect to the Platform being serviced (the "applicable servicing criteria").


McGladrey LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report on the assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria for the reporting period as set forth in this assertion.

Management's Assessment



Management of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a division of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, (the "Company") is responsible for assessing
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the
servicing of commercial loans (the "Platform"), except for servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv),
which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it
performs with respect to the Platform, as of and for the year ended December 31,
2013. Appendix A identifies the commercial mortgage pools and other structures
involving the commercial loans constituting the Platform. Appendix B identifies
the applicable servicing criteria with respect to the Platform.


With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii), the
Company performs applicable activities covered by these criteria, with respect
to the Platform, except the Company has engaged various vendors to perform
certain tax payment activities. Such vendors have provided separate Regulation
AB Item 1122 management assessments and attestations for such activities.


With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), there were
no activities performed during the year ended December 31, 2013 with respect
to the Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that would require
the Company to perform such activities.


With respect to servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(3)(i)(A),
1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(vi), the Company has engaged various vendors to
perform the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company's
management has determined that none of these vendors is considered a "servicer"
as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company's management has
elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendors'
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criteria
applicable to each vendor. The Company's management is solely responsible for
determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06
for the vendors and related criteria.


The Company's management has assessed the Company's compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.
In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item 1122 of Regulation
AB. Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2013, the Company has complied in all material respects with
the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report with respect to management's assessment of compliance with
the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended December 31,
2013.

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA



The management ("Management") of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Company") is responsible for assessing
the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards
to the servicing platform for the period as follows:


Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 (the "Period").


Platform: The platform consists of commercial mortgage-backed securities
("CMBS") transactions backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans and/or
backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee, securities
administration and/or paying agent services and where some or all of the
offered securities for such CMBS transactions were either (a) publicly-issued
pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the Securities Act of
1933, or (b) privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from registration where
the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an
assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item
1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any
transactions (i) where the offered securities were issued, sponsored or
guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any
government sponsored entity, and (ii) where the offered securities were issued
pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January 1, 2006 and for which
the Company outsources all material servicing activities (as defined by
Regulation AB) (the "CMBS Platform"). Appendix A identifies the individual
transactions defined by Management as constituting the CMBS Platform for the
Period.


Applicable Servicing Criteria: All servicing criteria set forth in Item
1122(d), to the extent required in the related transaction agreements, in
regards to the activities performed by the Company, except for the following
servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii), 1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v),
1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii), 1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix),
1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and
1122(d)(4)(xiv), which Management has determined are not applicable to the
activities the Company performed with respect to the CMBS Platform for the
Period (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria").


Third parties classified as vendors: With respect to servicing criterion
1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has engaged a vendor to handle certain Uniform
Commercial Code filing functions required by the servicing criterion.
Management has determined that this vendor is not considered a "servicer" as
defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and Management elects to take
responsibility for assessing compliance with the portion of the servicing
criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). The Company has policies and
procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's
activities comply in all material respects with the servicing criterion
applicable to the vendor. Management is solely responsible for determining that
the Company meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the
vendor and related criterion.


With respect to the CMBS Platform and the Period, Management provides the
following assessment of the Company's compliance with respect to the Applicable
Servicing Criteria:


1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company's compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria.


2. Management has assessed the Company's compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, including the servicing criterion for which compliance is
determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above. In performing this

ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SERVICING CRITERIA



The management ("Management") of the Corporate Trust Services division of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Company") is responsible for assessing
the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in
Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Management has determined that the servicing criteria are applicable in regards
to the servicing platform for the period as follows:


Period: As of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 (the "Period").


Platform: The platform consists of residential mortgage-backed securities
("RMBS") transactions backed by pools of residential mortgage loans and
commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") transactions backed by pools of
commercial mortgage loans, in each case for which the Company provides document
custody services and where the RMBS and CMBS transactions were either (a)
publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b) privately-issued pursuant to an
exemption from registration on or after January 1, 2006 where the Company has
an obligation under the transaction agreements to deliver an assessment of
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria under Item 1122(d) of
Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform excludes any transactions
where the offered securities were issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by any
agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or any government sponsored
entity, other than certain securitizations of residential mortgage loan
transactions issued, sponsored and/or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Company (the "Document Custody Platform"). Appendix A identifies the
individual transactions defined by Management as constituting the Document
Custody Platform for the Period.


Applicable Servicing Criteria: Management has determined that the servicing
criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(i),
1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the activities performed
by the Company with respect to the Document Custody Platform for the Period;
provided however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company's
obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"). Management has determined
that all other servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable
to the Document Custody Platform.


With respect to the Document Custody Platform and the Period, Management
provides the following assessment of the Company's compliance with respect to
the Applicable Servicing Criteria:


1. Management is responsible for assessing the Company's compliance with the
Applicable Servicing Criteria.


2. Management has assessed the Company's compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria. In performing this assessment, Management used the criteria
set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of Item
1122 of Regulation AB.


3. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii) and
1122(d)(4)(iii), Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the Period with respect to the Document Custody Platform,
because there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities.


4. Based on such assessment for the Period, the Company has complied, in all
material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
attestation report with respect to Management's assessment of the Company's
compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria for the Period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



To the Board of Directors and shareholders of CoreLogic, Inc.:


We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Report on
Assessment of Compliance, that CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc.
(the "Company"), an indirect subsidiary of CoreLogic, Inc. complied with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Regulation AB for all loans for commercial mortgage loan
outsourcing customers for which the Company served as the commercial tax service
provider (the "Platform"), as of December 31, 2013 and for the year then ended,
only including 1122(d)(1)(iv), 1122(d)(2)(v), 1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(2)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiii), which the Company has
determined are applicable to the servicing activities performed by it with
respect to the Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion based on our examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company performed those selected activities in compliance with the
applicable servicing criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected
servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from
errors that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have
affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.


In our opinion, management's assertion that the Company complied with the
aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2013 for all loans for commercial mortgage loan outsourcing
customers for which the Company served as the commercial tax service provider is
fairly stated, in all material respects.

T: (214) 999-1400, F: (214) 754-7991, www.pwc.com/us


(1) The transaction should have been indicated on Appendix A to the Company's
revised assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria dated
August 12, 2013 (the "Revised 2012 Custody Assessment") as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2012 (the "2012 Period") relating to the platform
for the 2012 Period (the "2012 Platform") as a transaction to which
Management is required to assess to the Company's compliance with Item
1122(d)(4)(iii). Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the 2012 Period with respect to the 2012 Platform, because
there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities.


A-13


(page)


(2) The transaction was inadvertently omitted from Appendix A to the Revised
2012 Custody Assessment.


(3) The transaction requires that Management assess to the Company's compliance
with Item 1122(d)(1)(ii). Item 1122(d)(1)(ii) was inadvertently omitted
from the applicable servicing criteria for the Revised 2012 Custody
Assessment. Management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the 2012 Period with respect to the 2012 Platform, because
there were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to
perform such activities.


(4) This transaction was indicated on Appendix A to the Revised 2012 Custody
Assessment as a transaction to which Management is required to assess to
the Company's compliance with Item 1122(d)(4)(iii). Management has since
determined that it is not required to assess to the Company's compliance
with Item 1122(d)(4)(iii). Therefore, such transaction should not have been
indicated on such Appendix A as subject to Item 1122(d)(4)(iii).

Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria, that Midland
Loan Services, a division of PNC Bank, National Association ("Midland" or the
"Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the commercial

with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assertion based on our examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly,
included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance
with the applicable servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as

of selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing of selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and
determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria. Our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing
activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this report.
Our procedures were not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors
that may have occurred prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have
affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during
the period covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a

1122(d)1(iv), 1122(d)2(ii), 1122(d)2(v), 1122(d)2(vi), 1122(d)2(vii),
1122(d)(4)(xi), and 1122(d)(4)(xii), are applicable to the activities performed
by it with respect to the Platform covered by this report. The Company has
determined that the remaining servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of
the SEC Regulation AB are not applicable to the activities performed by it with
respect to the Platform covered by this report. Management is responsible for
the Company's compliance with those servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assertion about the Company's compliance with
the servicing criteria based on our examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining,
on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included a selection of a sample
of transactions and compliance activities related to the Platform during the
examination period and determining whether the Company processed those
transactions and performed those activities in compliance with the servicing
criteria. Our testing of selected transactions and compliance activities was
limited to calculations, reports, and activities performed by the Company during
the period covered by this report. Our procedures did not include determining
whether errors may have occurred prior to our tests that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions.
We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.


Our examination disclosed the following material noncompliance with servicing
criteria 1122(d)2(vii) as applicable to National Tax Search as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2013. The noncompliance resulted from custodial account
reconciliations not being prepared within 30 calendar days after the bank
statement cut-off date and the existence of unresolved reconciling items
outstanding more than 90 calendar days.


In our opinion, except for the material noncompliance described above, National
Tax Search complied with the aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2013.

To the Board of Directors

Pentalpha Surveillance, LLC


We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Assessment of 2013 Compliance by Pentalpha Surveillance,
LLC With Regulation AB Servicing Criteria (Management's Assertion), that
Pentalpha Surveillance, LLC (the Company) complied with the servicing criteria
set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and Exchange Commission's
Regulation AB for services by the Company that are encompassed by contractual
obligations to perform Regulation AB reporting (the Platform), including only
those asset-backed securities transactions defined below, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2013, excluding the following criteria set forth in
Items 1122(d)(1)(i-iv), 1122(d)(2)(i-vii), 1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), 1122(d)(4)(i-vi)
and 1122(d)(4)(viii-xv), which management has determined are not applicable to
the activities performed by the Company with respect to the Platform covered by
this report. The Exhibit to management's assertion identifies the individual
asset-backed transactions defined by management as constituting the Platform.
Management is responsible for the Company's compliance with the applicable
servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's
assertion about the Company's compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
based on our examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as
adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and,
accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's
compliance with the applicable servicing criteria, including tests on a sample
basis of the servicing activities related to the Platform, determining whether
the Company performed those activities in compliance with the servicing criteria
during the specified period and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our procedures were limited to
selected servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered
by this report and, accordingly, such samples may not have included servicing
activities related to each asset-backed transaction in the Platform. Further, an
examination is not designed to detect noncompliance arising from errors that may
have occurred prior to the period specified above that may have affected the
balances or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period
covered by this report. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on
the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.


In our opinion, management's assertion that Pentalpha Surveillance, LLC complied
with the aforementioned applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2013 for the Platform, is fairly stated, in all material
respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



The Board of Directors

Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:


We have examined management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management's Assessment, that Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Servicing, a
division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the "Company") complied
with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for the servicing of commercial loans (the
"Platform"), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(B-D),
1122(d)(3)(ii-iv), and 1122(d)(4)(xv), which the Company has determined are not
applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform, as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2013. The Company has determined that
servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii) are applicable to the
activities the Company performs with respect to the Platform, except for certain
tax payment activities which the Company has engaged various vendors to
perform. With respect to applicable servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii), the
Company has determined that there were no activities performed during the year
ended December 31, 2013 with respect to the Platform, because there were no
occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities.
Appendix A to the accompanying Management's Assessment identifies the
commercial mortgage pools and other structures involving the commercial loans
defined by management as constituting the Platform. Management is responsible
for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on management's assessment about the Company's compliance
based on our examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the Platform,
testing selected servicing activities related to the Platform, and determining
whether the Company processed those selected transactions and performed those
selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria. Furthermore, our
procedures were limited to the selected transactions and servicing activities
performed by the Company during the period covered by this report. Our
procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have occurred
either prior to or subsequent to our tests that may have affected the balances
or amounts calculated or reported by the Company during the period covered by
this report for the selected transactions or any other transactions. We believe
that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our
examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's compliance
with the servicing criteria.


As described in the accompanying Management's Assessment, for servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(i), 1122(d)(3)(i)(A), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(vi), the
Company has engaged various vendors to perform

the activities required by these servicing criteria. The Company has determined
that none of these vendors is considered a "servicer" as defined in Item
1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has elected to take responsibility
for assessing compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to each vendor
as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the SEC Division of Corporation Finance
Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations (Interpretation 17.06).
As permitted by Interpretation 17.06, the Company has asserted that it has
policies and procedures in place designed to provide reasonable assurance that
the vendors' activities comply in all material respects with the servicing
criteria applicable to each vendor. The Company is solely responsible for
determining that it meets the SEC requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for
the vendors and related criteria as described in its assertion, and we performed
no procedures with respect to the Company's eligibility to apply Interpretation
17.06.


In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria, including servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(i),
1122(d)(3)(i)(A), 1122(d)(4)(i), and 1122(d)(4)(vi), for which compliance is
determined based on Interpretation 17.06 as described above, as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2013 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm



The Board of Directors

The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:


We have examined the management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, that the
Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

(the "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)

of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for commercial
mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") transactions backed by pools of commercial
mortgage loans and/or backed by CMBS for which the Company provides trustee,
securities administration and/or paying agent services and where some or all of
the offered securities for such CMBS transactions were either (a)
publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement delivered under the
Securities Act of 1933, or (b) privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from
registration where the Company has an obligation under the transaction
agreements to deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing
criteria under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the
platform excludes any transactions (i) where the offered securities were
issued, sponsored or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government or any government sponsored entity, and (ii) where the offered
securities were issued pursuant to a transaction that closed prior to January
1, 2006 and for which the Company outsources all material servicing activities
(as defined by Regulation AB) (the "CMBS Platform") to the extent required in
the related transaction agreements, in regards to the activities performed by
the Company, except for the following servicing criteria: 1122(d)(4)(ii),
1122(d)(4)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(vii),
1122(d)(4)(viii), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi),
1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii) and 1122(d)(4)(xiv), which management has
determined are not applicable to the activities the Company performed with
respect to the CMBS Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31,
2013 (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"). With respect to applicable
servicing criteria 1122(d)(2)(iii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii), management has
determined that there were no activities performed during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2013 with respect to the Platform, because there were no
occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such
activities. Appendix A to the Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable
Servicing Criteria identifies the individual transactions and securities
defined by management as constituting the CMBS Platform. Management is
responsible for the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment about the
Company's compliance based on our examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Company's compliance with the
servicing criteria specified above and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. Our examination included testing
selected asset-backed transactions and securities that comprise the CMBS
Platform, testing selected servicing activities related to the CMBS Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the

period covered by this report. Our procedures were not designed to determine
whether errors may have occurred either prior to or subsequent to our tests
that may have affected the balances or amounts calculated or reported by the
Company during the period covered by this report for the selected transactions
or any other transactions. We believe that our examination provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal
determination on the Company's compliance with the servicing criteria.


As described in the accompanying Assessment of Compliance With the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, for servicing criterion 1122(d)(4)(i), the Company has
engaged a vendor to perform the activities required by this servicing
criterion. The Company has determined that this vendor is not considered a
"servicer" as defined in Item 1101(j) of Regulation AB, and the Company has
elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the servicing
criterion applicable to this vendor as permitted by Interpretation 17.06 of the
SEC Division of Corporation Finance Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations ("Interpretation 17.06"). As permitted by Interpretation 17.06,
the Company has asserted that it has policies and procedures in place designed
to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor's activities comply in all
material respects with the servicing criterion applicable to the vendor. The
Company is solely responsible for determining that it meets the SEC
requirements to apply Interpretation 17.06 for the vendor and related criterion
as described in management's Assessment of Compliance With the Applicable
Servicing Criteria, and we performed no procedures with respect to the Company's
eligibility to apply Interpretation 17.06.


In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company complied with the
aforementioned servicing criteria as of and for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2013 is fairly stated, in all material respects.

The Board of Directors

The Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association:


We have examined the management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria, that the
Corporate Trust Services division of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association

(the "Company") complied with the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)

of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation AB for residential
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") transactions backed by pools of residential
mortgage loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") transactions
backed by pools of commercial mortgage loans, in each case for which the
Company provides document custody services and where the RMBS and CMBS
transactions were either (a) publicly-issued pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006, or (b)
privately-issued pursuant to an exemption from registration on or after January
1, 2006 where the Company has an obligation under the transaction agreements to
deliver an assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria
under Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB; provided however that, the platform
excludes any transactions where the offered securities were issued, sponsored
and/ or guaranteed by any agency or instrumentality of the U.S. government or
any government sponsored entity, other than certain securitizations of
residential mortgage loan transactions issued, sponsored and/ or guaranteed by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (the "Document Custody Platform") as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. Management has determined
that the servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(1)(ii), 1122(d)(1)(iv),
1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(ii) and 1122(d)(4)(iii) are applicable to the
activities performed by the Company with respect to the Document Custody
Platform as of and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013; provided
however that, with respect to the Document Custody Platform, servicing
criterion 1122(d)(4)(iii) is applicable only as it relates to the Company's
obligation to review and maintain the required loan documents related to any
additions, removals or substitutions in accordance with the transaction
agreements (the "Applicable Servicing Criteria"), as of and for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2013. Management has determined that all other
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the Document
Custody Platform. With respect to applicable servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(ii)
and 1122(d)(4)(iii), management has determined that there were no activities
performed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 with respect to the
Document Custody Platform, because there were no occurrences of events that
would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to the
Assessment of Compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria identifies the
individual transactions and securities defined by management as constituting
the Document Custody Platform. Management is responsible for the Company's
compliance with the servicing criteria. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management's assessment about the Companys compliance based on our
examination.


Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included

testing selected servicing activities related to the Document Custody Platform,
and determining whether the Company processed those selected transactions and
performed those selected activities in compliance with the servicing criteria.
Furthermore, our procedures were limited to the selected transactions and
servicing activities performed by the Company during the period covered by this
report. Our procedures were not designed to determine whether errors may have

Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Company's

Why do we ask for Social Security?



Social Security Number


Why do we ask for your Social Security Number

Freddie Mac takes protecting your privacy seriously. We ask for your Social Security Number (SSN) to help us confirm that the requested information is being given to the mortgage holder or to someone authorized by the mortgage holder to receive the information.
We ask for your SSN because it allows us to quickly and accurately determine if your mortgage is held by Freddie Mac and to deliver an answer to you immediately. Providing a SSN increases the speed and accuracy of the look-up response.
We take measures to protect the SSN that you deliver to us (see below).

How do we handle your SSN after you enter it?

The SSN you enter within this form is only used to answer your specific look-up request. We do not save the number you enter or distribute it to a third party for any other purpose.
All information you enter in this form is transmitted from your web browser to our site via an encrypted communication channel. Please review our privacy policy for more details.

Do you have to provide your SSN number?

No. If you wish, you may submit an email request that does not require your SSN. Our customer service representatives will respond as quickly as they can, but given current demand it may take several days. Please be patient.

The Depositor intends to sell Certificates, to be issued hereunder in multiple Classes, which in the aggregate will evidence the entire beneficial ownership interest in the Trust to be created hereunder.
 
REMIC I

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination becomes a Required Appraisal Loan, (ii) either (A) no Appraisal or update thereof has been obtained or conducted, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.19(a), with respect to the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property, as the case may be, during the nine-month period prior to the date such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination became a Required Appraisal Loan or (B) there shall have occurred since the date of the most recent Appraisal or update thereof a material change in the circumstances surrounding the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property, as the case may be, that would, in the Special Servicer’s reasonable judgment, materially affect the value of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property, as the case may be, and (iii) no
new Appraisal is obtained or conducted, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.19(a), within sixty (60) days after such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination became a Required Appraisal Loan, then (x) until such new Appraisal is obtained or conducted, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.19(a), the Appraisal Reduction Amount shall equal 25% of the Stated Principal Balance of such Required Appraisal Loan, and (y) upon receipt or performance, as applicable, in accordance with Section 3.19(a), of such Appraisal or update thereof by the Special Servicer, the Appraisal Reduction Amount for such Required Appraisal Loan shall be recalculated in accordance with the preceding sentence of this definition.

-10-





  


 
Also notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect, the determination of Appraisal Reduction Amounts will be subject to the provisions and procedures set forth under Section 3.19.
 
An Appraisal Reduction Amount with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan will be reduced to zero as of the date on which all Servicing Transfer Events have ceased to exist with respect to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan and at least ninety (90) days have passed following the occurrence of the most recent Appraisal Trigger Event.  No Appraisal Reduction Amount will exist as to any Serviced Mortgage Loan after it has been paid in full or it (or the REO Property) has been liquidated or otherwise disposed of.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the Appraisal Reduction Amount shall be the “Appraisal Reduction Amount” calculated pursuant to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the parties hereto shall be entitled to rely on such calculations as reported to them by the Non-Trust Master Servicer.  By their acceptance of their Certificates, the Certificateholders will be deemed to have acknowledged that any Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement related to the applicable Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, taken together, provide that any such “Appraisal Reduction Amount” shall be calculated by the Non-Trust Master Servicer under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

(d)           In connection with the Depositor’s assignment pursuant to Section 2.01(b) above, the parties acknowledge that each Mortgage Loan Seller is obligated, at such Mortgage Loan Seller’s expense, pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, to deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, (i) on or before the Closing Date, the Mortgage Note relating to each Mortgage Loan so assigned, endorsed to the Trustee as specified in clause (i) of the definition of “Mortgage File” (or, alternatively, if the original executed Mortgage Note has been lost, a lost note affidavit and indemnity with a copy of such Mortgage Note as specified in clause (i) of the definition of “Mortgage File”)  and (ii) on or before the respective delivery dates therefor set

obligation of such Mortgage Loan Seller to nonetheless (1) from time to time make or cause to be made reasonably diligent efforts to obtain such document or instrument (with such evidence) if it is not returned within a reasonable period after the date when it was transmitted for recording and (2) deliver such document or instrument to the Custodian (if such document or instrument is not otherwise returned to the Custodian) promptly upon such Mortgage Loan Seller’s receipt thereof), so long as a copy of such document or instrument, certified by such Mortgage Loan Seller or title agent as being a copy of the document deposited for recording or filing and (in the case of such clause (ii)) accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate of the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller or a statement from the title agent to the effect that such original Mortgage has been sent to the appropriate public recording official for recordation, has been
delivered to the Custodian on or before the respective delivery dates therefor set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the delivery requirements of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File; or if the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller cannot or does not so deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan (exclusive of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), the original of any of the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (iv) and (ix)(B) of the definition of “Mortgage File”, because such document or instrument has been delivered for recording or filing, as the case may be, then (subject to the obligation of such Mortgage Loan Seller to nonetheless (1) from time to time make or cause to be made reasonably diligent efforts
to obtain such document or instrument (with such evidence) if it is not returned within a reasonable period after the date when it was transmitted for recording and (2) deliver such document or instrument to the Custodian (if such document or instrument is not otherwise returned to the Custodian) promptly upon such Mortgage Loan Seller’s receipt thereof), so long as a copy of such document or instrument, certified by such Mortgage Loan Seller, a title agent or a recording or filing agent as being a copy of the document deposited for recording or filing and accompanied by an Officer’s Certificate of such Mortgage Loan Seller or a statement from the title agent that such document or instrument has been sent to the appropriate public recording official for recordation (except that such copy and certification shall not be required if the Custodian is responsible for recordation of such document or instrument under this Agreement and such Mortgage Loan Seller has delivered
the original unrecorded document or instrument to the Custodian on or before the date that is forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date), has been delivered to the Custodian on or before the respective delivery dates therefor set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the delivery requirements of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File.  In addition, with respect to each Mortgage Loan (exclusive of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) under which any Additional Collateral is in the form of a Letter of Credit as of the Closing Date, the parties acknowledge that the related Mortgage Loan Seller is contractually obligated to cause to be prepared, executed and delivered to the issuer of each such Letter of Credit such notices, assignments and acknowledgments as are required under such Letter
of Credit to assign, without recourse, to the Trustee the related Mortgage Loan Seller’s rights as the beneficiary thereof and drawing party thereunder.  Furthermore, with respect to each Mortgage Loan (exclusive of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), if any, as to which there exists a secured creditor impaired property insurance policy or pollution limited liability environmental impairment policy covering the related Mortgaged Property, the related Mortgage Loan Seller is 
 


  


-110-





  


 
contractually obligated to cause such policy, within a reasonable period following the Closing Date, to inure to the benefit of the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders (if and to the extent that it does not by its terms automatically inure to the holder of such Mortgage Loan).  The Depositor shall deliver to the Trustee and the Custodian on or before the Closing Date a fully executed counterpart of each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.  With respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the parties hereto acknowledge the provisions of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in which the related Mortgage Loan Seller represents, warrants and covenants to the effect that the documents described in clauses (ii), (iii) and (xi) of the definition of “Mortgage File” and documents comparable to those described in clauses
(iv), (vi) and (ix)(B) of the definition of “Mortgage File” have been delivered to the trustee or custodian under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, except to the extent that the absence of such document does not constitute a breach pursuant to the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  In addition, with respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the parties hereto acknowledge the provisions of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in which the related Mortgage Loan Seller represents, warrants and covenants to the effect that any “Document Defect” as such term is defined in the applicable Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall constitute a Document Defect under the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the promissory note related to
a Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.  None of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Custodian, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be liable for any failure by any Mortgage Loan Seller to comply with the document delivery requirements of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.
 
(e)           The parties hereto acknowledge that each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement requires the related Mortgage Loan Seller, or its designee, to itself submit, or cause to be submitted, (i) each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases in favor of the Trustee referred to in clause (iv) of the definition of “Mortgage File” and (ii) each assignment of UCC Financing Statement in favor of the Trustee referred to in clause (ix)(B) of the definition of “Mortgage File”, for recording or filing to the extent that they are related to Mortgage Loans for which it is the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller.  Each such assignment shall reflect that it should be returned by the public recording office to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee, and such Mortgage Loan Seller has agreed in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to deliver or cause the delivery of each such assignment
to the Custodian (with a copy thereof to the Master Servicer)) following recording, and each such assignment of UCC Financing Statement shall reflect that the file copy thereof or an appropriate receipt therefor, as applicable, should be returned to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller or its designee, and such Mortgage Loan Seller has agreed in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to deliver or cause the delivery of each such assignment to the Custodian (with a copy thereof to the Master Servicer) following filing; provided that in those instances where the public recording office retains the original assignment of Mortgage or assignment of Assignment of Leases, the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller has agreed to obtain therefrom a copy of the recorded original and is required to provide a copy of such recorded original to the Custodian (with a copy to the Master Servicer).  The parties hereto further acknowledge that each Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement requires the related Mortgage Loan Seller, if any such document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, to prepare or cause to be prepared promptly a substitute therefor or cure such defect, as the case may be, and thereafter cause the same to be duly recorded or filed, as appropriate.

Section 2.02     Acceptance of Mortgage Loans by Trustee.
 
(a)           Subject to the other provisions in this Section 2.02, the Trustee, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby accepts receipt on behalf of the Trust, through the Custodian on its behalf, of (i) the Original Mortgage Loans and all documents delivered to the Custodian that constitute portions of the related Mortgage Files and (ii) all other assets delivered to the Custodian and included in the Trust Fund, in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim.  The Custodian declares that it holds and will hold such documents and any other documents received by it that constitute portions of the Mortgage Files, and that it holds

the Mortgage Loan Sellers, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders (in each case, provided that the Custodian has received notice of the identity of and notice address information for such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder), the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative that, as to each Original Mortgage Loan then subject to this Agreement (except as specifically identified in any exception report annexed to such certification):  (i) the original Mortgage Note specified in clause (i) of the definition of “Mortgage File” and all allonges thereto, if any (or a copy of such Mortgage Note, together with a lost note affidavit and indemnity), the original or copy of documents specified in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) (except with respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), (viii) (without regard
to the verification of the effective date with respect to a title policy or the date of funding with respect to a title commitment), (x) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that a material portion of the interest of the Borrower in the related Mortgaged Property consists of a leasehold interest) and (xx) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that the Mortgaged Property type is a hospitality property) of the definition of “Mortgage File” have been received by it; (ii) if such report is due more than 180 days after the Closing Date, the recordation/filing contemplated by Section 2.01(e) has been completed (based solely on receipt by the Custodian of the particular recorded/filed documents or an appropriate receipt of recording/filing therefor); (iii) all documents received by it with respect to such Mortgage Loan have been reviewed by it and (A) appear regular on
their face (handwritten additions, changes or corrections shall not constitute irregularities if initialed by the

Borrower), (B) appear to have been executed and (C) purport to relate to such Mortgage Loan; and (iv) based on the examinations referred to in Section 2.02(a) above and this Section 2.02(b) and only as to the foregoing documents, the information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to the items specified in clause (iii)(A) and clause (vi) of the definition of “Mortgage Loan Schedule” accurately reflects the information set forth in the related Mortgage File.  Every ninety (90) days after such 75th day following the Closing Date, until the earlier of (i) the date on which such exceptions are eliminated and such recordation/filing has been completed, and (ii) the date on which all the affected Mortgage Loans are removed from the Trust Fund, the Custodian shall deliver

address and e-mail address of each initial Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is set forth on Schedule X hereto.
 
(c)           If a Responsible Repurchase Party substitutes a Replacement Mortgage Loan for any Defective Mortgage Loan as contemplated by Section 2.03, the Custodian shall review the documents delivered to it with respect to such Replacement Mortgage Loan, and the Custodian shall deliver a certification comparable to that described in the prior paragraph, in respect of such Replacement Mortgage Loan, on or about the 30th day following the related date of substitution (and, if any exceptions are noted, every ninety (90) days thereafter until the earlier of (i) the date on which such exceptions are eliminated and all related recording/filing has been completed, and (ii) the date on which such Replacement Mortgage Loan is removed from the Trust Fund).
 
With respect to the documents described in clause (iii) of the definition of “Mortgage File”, absent actual knowledge to the contrary, the Custodian may assume, for purposes of the certification(s) delivered in this Section 2.02(c) or to be delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(b), that the Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan includes a separate Assignment of Leases.
 
With respect to the documents described in clause (ix) of the definition of “Mortgage File”, absent actual knowledge to the contrary or copies of UCC Financing Statements delivered to the Custodian as part of the Mortgage File indicating otherwise, the Custodian may assume, for purposes of the certification(s) to be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.02(c), that the Mortgage File for each Mortgage Loan should include a copy of one state-level UCC Financing Statement filed in the state of incorporation or organization of the related Borrower for each Mortgaged Property (or with respect to any Mortgage Loan that has two or more Borrowers, for each related Borrower).  To the extent appropriate under applicable law, the UCC Financing Statements to be assigned to the Trustee will be delivered on the new

national forms and in recordable form and will be filed in the state of incorporation or organization as so indicated on the documents provided.
 
(d)           None of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, any Sub-Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Custodian is under any duty or obligation to (i) determine whether any of the documents specified in clauses (iii), (iv)(B), (v), (vi), (vii), (ix) and (xi) through (xviii) of the definition of “Mortgage File” exist or are required to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Sellers in respect of any Mortgage Loan unless such item(s) are specified on the related Mortgage File Checklist, or (ii) inspect, review or examine any of the documents, instruments, certificates or other papers relating to the Mortgage Loans delivered to it to determine that the same are valid, legal, effective,
genuine, binding, enforceable, sufficient or appropriate for the represented purpose or that they are other than what they purport to be on their face.  Furthermore, except as expressly provided in Section 2.01(e), none of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, any Sub-Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Custodian shall have any responsibility for determining whether the text of any assignment or endorsement is in proper or recordable form, whether the requisite recording of any document is in accordance with the requirements of any applicable jurisdiction, or whether a blanket assignment is permitted in any applicable jurisdiction.
 
(e)           In performing the reviews contemplated by subsections (a) and (b) above, the Custodian may conclusively rely on the related Mortgage Loan Seller as to the purported genuineness of any such document and any signature thereon.  It is understood that the scope of the Custodian’s review of the Mortgage Files is limited solely to confirming that the documents specified in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (except with respect to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), (viii) (without regard to the verification of the effective date with respect to a title policy or the date of funding with respect to a title commitment), (x) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that a material portion of the interest of the Borrower in the related
Mortgaged Property consists of a leasehold interest) and (xx) (if the Mortgage Loan Schedule specifies that the Mortgaged Property type is a hospitality property) of the definition of “Mortgage File” have been received by it and such additional information as will be necessary for delivering the certifications required by subsections (a) and (b) above.
 
Section 2.03     Certain Repurchases and Substitutions of Mortgage Loans by the Responsible Repurchase Parties.
 
(a)           If, in the process of reviewing the documents delivered or caused to be delivered by the Mortgage Loan Sellers as contemplated by Section 2.01(d), the Custodian discovers that any document required to have been delivered as contemplated by Section 2.01(d) has not been so delivered, or discovers that any of the documents that were delivered has not been properly executed, contains information that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, or is defective on its face (each, including, without limitation, that a document is missing, a “Document Defect”), or if, at any other time, the Custodian or any other party hereto discovers (without implying that any such party has a duty to make or attempt to make such discovery)
a Document Defect in respect of any Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such Document Defect shall promptly so notify each of the other parties hereto.  If any party hereto discovers (without implying that any such party has a duty to make or attempt to make such discovery) or receives notice of a breach of any 
 


  


-115-





  


 
representation or warranty relating to any Mortgage Loan set forth in or made pursuant to Section 4(b) or 4(g) of any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (a “Breach”), such party shall promptly so notify each of the other parties hereto.  Upon the Trustee’s discovery or receipt of notice that a Document Defect or Breach exists with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the Trustee shall notify the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, Custodian, the related Responsible Repurchase Party and the Rating Agencies.
 
(b)           Promptly upon its actual knowledge of any Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan or its receipt of notice from the Trustee or any other party to this Agreement of a Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall (and the Special Servicer may) notify the related Responsible Repurchase Party in writing (in each case, with a copy of the Depositor) of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, and direct such Responsible Repurchase Party that it must, not later than (1) ninety (90) days from discovery of the subject Material Document Defect or Material Breach by the Responsible Repurchase Party, or (2) ninety (90) days from the receipt by such Responsible Repurchase Party of such notice (or, if (x) such Material Breach or Material Document Defect, as the case may be, relates
to whether such Mortgage Loan is or, as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Replacement Mortgage Loan, as of the related date of substitution), was a Qualified Mortgage, and (y) such Responsible Repurchase Party discovered or received prompt written notice of the relation specified in clause (x), then (z) within ninety (90) days after any earlier discovery by the Responsible Repurchase Party or any party to this Agreement of such Material Breach or Material Document Defect, as the case may be) (such 90-day period, in any case, the “Initial Resolution Period”), correct or cure such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, in all material respects, or repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan (as, if and to the extent required by the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement), at the applicable Purchase Price; provided that if such Responsible Repurchase Party certifies to the
Trustee in writing (i) that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, does not relate to whether the affected Mortgage Loan is or, as of the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Replacement Mortgage Loan, as of the related date of substitution), was a Qualified Mortgage, (ii) that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, is capable of being cured but not within the applicable Initial Resolution Period, (iii) that such Responsible Repurchase Party has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, during the applicable Initial Resolution Period, (iv) in the case of a Material Document Defect, that (x) the related Mortgage Loan is not, at the end of the Initial Resolution Period, then a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and a Servicing Transfer Event has not occurred as a result of a monetary default or as described in clause (e),
(f) or (g) of the definition of “Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan” in this Agreement and (y) the Material Document Defect was not identified in a certification delivered to the Mortgage Loan Seller by the Custodian pursuant to Section 2.02 not less than ninety (90) days prior to the delivery of the notice of such Material Document Defect, and (v) that such Responsible Repurchase Party anticipates that such Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, will be cured within an additional 90-day period (such additional 90-day period, the “Resolution Extension Period”) (a copy of which certification shall be delivered by the Trustee to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Rating Agencies), then such Responsible

 


  


-116-





  


 
Repurchase Party shall have an additional period equal to the Resolution Extension Period to complete such correction or cure (or, upon failure to complete such correction or cure, for the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party to repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan); and provided, further, that, in lieu of repurchasing the affected Mortgage Loan as contemplated above (but, in any event, no later than such repurchase would have to have been completed), the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party shall be permitted, during the three-month period following the Startup Day for the REMIC Pool that holds the affected Mortgage Loan (or during the two-year period following such Startup Day if the affected Mortgage Loan is a “defective obligation” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(4)(B)(ii) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(f)), to replace the affected
Mortgage Loan with one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans and to pay a cash amount equal to the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount, subject to any other applicable terms and conditions of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement and this Agreement.  The parties hereto agree that delivery by the Custodian of a certification or schedule of exceptions to a Mortgage Loan Seller or Responsible Repurchase Party shall not in and of itself constitute delivery of notice of any Material Document Defect or knowledge of such Mortgage Loan Seller or Responsible Repurchase Party of any Material Document Defect.  If any Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced as contemplated by this Section 2.03, the Master Servicer shall designate the Collection Account as the account to which funds in the amount of the applicable Purchase Price or Substitution Shortfall Amount (as the case may be) are
to be wired, and the Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator when such deposit is made.  Any such repurchase or replacement of a Mortgage Loan shall be on a whole loan, servicing released basis.  Notwithstanding this Section 2.03(b), the absence from the Mortgage File, (i) on the Closing Date of the Mortgage Note (or a lost note affidavit and indemnity with a copy of the Mortgage Note) and (ii) by the first anniversary of the Closing Date, of originals or copies of any other Specially Designated Mortgage Loan Document (without the presence of any factor that reasonably mitigates such absence, non-conformity or irregularity) shall (if the absence results from the related Mortgage Loan Seller’s failure to deliver such Specially Designated Mortgage Loan Document in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement) be conclusively presumed
to be a Material Document Defect and shall obligate the party discovering such absence to give the Trustee prompt notice, whereupon the Trustee shall notify the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party (with a copy to the Depositor) to cure such Material Document Defect, or, failing that, repurchase or replace the related Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, all in accordance with the procedures set forth, and to the extent permitted, herein.  Notwithstanding this Section 2.03(b), in the event of any Breach described in the second paragraph of Section 5(d) of any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the remedy described in such second paragraph of such Section 5(d) shall constitute the sole remedy available to the Trustee and any other affected Person with respect to such Breach.
 
The remedies provided for in this Section 2.03(b) with respect to any Material Document Defect or Material Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan shall apply to the related REO Property.
 
If (x) a Defective Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced as described above, (y) such Defective Mortgage Loan is part of a Cross-Collateralized Group and (z) the applicable Document Defect or Breach does not constitute a Material Document Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be, as to the other Mortgage Loan(s) that are a part of such

Cross-Collateralized Group (the “Other Crossed Loans”) (without regard to this paragraph), then the applicable Document Defect or Breach (as the case may be) shall be deemed to constitute a Material Document Defect or Material Breach (as the case may be) as to each such Other Crossed Loan for purposes of the above provisions, and the related Responsible Repurchase Party shall be obligated to repurchase or replace each such Other Crossed Loan in accordance with the provisions above unless, in the case of such Breach or Document Defect:
 
(A)          the related Responsible Repurchase Party (at its expense) delivers or causes to be delivered to the Trustee and the Master Servicer an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such Responsible Repurchase Party’s repurchase of only those Mortgage Loans as to which a Material Breach has actually occurred without regard to the provisions of this paragraph (the “Affected Loan(s)”) and the operation of the remaining provisions of this Section 2.03(b) will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event or any Adverse Grantor Trust Event hereunder; and
 
(B)          each of the following conditions would be satisfied if the related Responsible Repurchase Party were to repurchase or replace only the Affected Loans and not the Other Crossed Loans:
 
(I)           the debt service coverage ratio for such Other Crossed Loan(s) (excluding the Affected Loan(s)) for the four calendar quarters immediately preceding the repurchase or replacement is not less than the least of (A) 0.10x below the debt service coverage ratio for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Annex A-1 to the Prospectus Supplement, (B) the debt service coverage ratio for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) for the four preceding calendar quarters preceding the repurchase or replacement and (C) 1.25x;
 
(II)          the loan-to-value ratio for the Other Crossed Loans is not greater than the greatest of (A) the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a whole number percentage (taken to one decimal place), for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) set forth in Annex A-1 to the Prospectus Supplement plus 10%, (B) the loan-to-value ratio, expressed as a whole number percentage (taken to one decimal place), for the Cross-Collateralized Group (including the Affected Loan(s)) at the time of repurchase or replacement and (C) 75%; and
 
(III)        the exercise of remedies against the Primary Collateral of any Mortgage Loan in the Cross-Collateralized Group shall not impair the ability to exercise remedies against the Primary Collateral of the other Mortgage Loans in the Cross-Collateralized Group.
 
The determination of the Master Servicer as to whether the conditions set forth above have been satisfied shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error.  The Master Servicer will be entitled to cause to be delivered, or direct the related Responsible Repurchase Party to cause to be delivered, to the Master Servicer an Appraisal of any or all of the related Mortgaged

Properties for purposes of determining whether the condition set forth in clause (ii) above has been satisfied, in each case at the expense of the related Responsible Repurchase Party if the scope and cost of the Appraisal is approved by the related Responsible Repurchase Party and the Subordinate Class Representative (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld in each case).
 
With respect to any Defective Mortgage Loan that forms a part of a Cross-Collateralized Group and as to which the conditions described in the preceding paragraph are satisfied, such that the Trust Fund will continue to hold the Other Crossed Loans, the related Responsible Repurchase Party and the Trustee, as successor to the Depositor, are bound by an agreement (set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement) to forbear from enforcing any remedies against the other’s Primary Collateral but each is permitted to exercise remedies against the Primary Collateral securing its respective Mortgage Loans, including with respect to the Trustee, the Primary Collateral securing the Affected Loan(s) still held by the Trustee.  If the exercise of remedies by one such party would impair the ability of the other such party to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral securing the Affected Loan or the Other Crossed
Loans, as the case may be, held by the other such party, then both parties have agreed to forbear from exercising such remedies unless and until the Mortgage Loan Documents evidencing and securing the relevant Mortgage Loans can be modified in a manner that complies with the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to remove the threat of impairment as a result of the exercise of remedies.  Any reserve or other cash collateral or Letters of Credit securing any of the Cross-Collateralized Mortgage Loans shall be allocated between such Mortgage Loans in accordance with the Mortgage Loan Documents, or otherwise on a pro rata basis based upon their outstanding Stated Principal Balances.  All other terms of the Mortgage Loans shall remain in full force and effect, without any modification thereof.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be binding on all future holders of each Mortgage Loan that forms part of a Cross-Collateralized Group.
 
To the extent necessary and appropriate, the Trustee shall execute (or, subject to Section 3.01(b) and Section 3.10, provide the Master Servicer with a limited power of attorney that enables the Master Servicer to execute) the modification of the Mortgage Loan Documents that complies with the applicable Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to remove the threat of impairment of the ability of the Responsible Repurchase Party or the Trust Fund to exercise its remedies with respect to the Primary Collateral securing the Mortgage Loan(s) held by such party resulting from the exercise of remedies by the other such party; provided that the Trustee shall not be liable for any misuse of any such power
of attorney by the Master Servicer.  The Master Servicer shall advance all costs and expenses incurred by the Trustee and the Master Servicer with respect to any Cross-Collateralized Group pursuant to this paragraph, and such advances and interest thereon shall (i) constitute and be reimbursable as Servicing Advances and (ii) be included in the calculation of Purchase Price for the Mortgage Loan(s) to be repurchased or replaced.  The Master Servicer shall not be liable to any Certificateholder or any other party hereto if a modification of the Mortgage Loan Documents described above cannot be effected for any reason beyond the control of the Master Servicer.
 
The reasonable “out-of-pocket” costs and expenses incurred by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Custodian pursuant to this Section 2.03(b), including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, shall constitute Servicing Advances to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party.

(c)           Whenever one or more Replacement Mortgage Loans are substituted for a Defective Mortgage Loan by a Mortgage Loan Seller as contemplated by this Section 2.03, the Master Servicer shall direct the party effecting the substitution to deliver to the Custodian the related Mortgage File and a certification to the effect that such Replacement Mortgage Loan satisfies or such Replacement Mortgage Loans satisfy, as the case may be, all of the requirements of the definition of “Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan”.  No mortgage loan may be substituted for a Defective Mortgage Loan as contemplated by this Section 2.03 if the Mortgage Loan to be replaced was itself a Replacement Mortgage Loan, in which case, absent a cure of the relevant Material Breach or Material
Document Defect, the affected Mortgage Loan will be required to be repurchased as contemplated hereby.  Monthly Payments due with respect to each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) after the related date of substitution, and Monthly Payments due with respect to each corresponding Deleted Mortgage Loan (if any) after its respective Cut-off Date and on or prior to the related date of substitution, shall be part of the Trust Fund.  Monthly Payments due with respect to each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) on or prior to the related date of substitution, and Monthly Payments due with respect to each corresponding Deleted Mortgage Loan (if any) after the related date of substitution, shall not be part of the Trust Fund and are to be remitted by the Master Servicer to the party effecting the related substitution promptly following receipt.
 
If any Mortgage Loan is to be repurchased or replaced by a Responsible Repurchase Party as contemplated by this Section 2.03, the Master Servicer shall direct such party to amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of any Deleted Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, the substitution of the related Replacement Mortgage Loan(s); and, upon its receipt of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Master Servicer shall deliver or cause the delivery of such amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the other parties hereto.  Upon any substitution of one or more Replacement Mortgage Loans for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, such Replacement Mortgage Loan(s) shall become part of the Trust Fund and be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects.
 
The reasonable “out-of-pocket” costs and expenses incurred by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Custodian pursuant to this Section 2.03(b), including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, shall constitute Servicing Advances to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party.
 
(d)           Upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate from the Master Servicer to the effect that the full amount of the Purchase Price or Substitution Shortfall Amount (as the case may be) for any Mortgage Loan repurchased or replaced by the related Responsible Repurchase Party as contemplated by this Section 2.03 has been deposited in the Collection Account, and further, if applicable, upon receipt of the Mortgage File for each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) to be substituted for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, together with any certifications and/or opinions required pursuant to Section 2.03(b) to be delivered by the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party, the Trustee and the Custodian shall each (i) release the Mortgage File and any Additional Collateral held by it or
on its behalf for the Deleted Mortgage Loan to the related Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee and (ii) execute and deliver such instruments of release, transfer and/or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be provided to it and are reasonably necessary to vest in the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee the ownership of the Deleted Mortgage Loan, and the Master Servicer shall notify the Depositor 
 


  


-120-





  


 
and the affected Borrowers of the transfers of the Deleted Mortgage Loan(s) and any Replacement Mortgage Loan(s).  In connection with any such repurchase or substitution by the related Responsible Repurchase Party, each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall deliver to the applicable Responsible Repurchase Party or its designee any portion of the related Servicing File, together with any Escrow Payments, Reserve Funds and Additional Collateral, held by or on behalf of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, with respect to the Deleted Mortgage Loan, in each case at the expense of such Responsible Repurchase Party.  The reasonable “out-of-pocket” costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, incurred by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Custodian pursuant to this Section 2.03(d),
to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase Party, shall be reimbursable to each of them as Servicing Advances in respect of the affected Mortgage Loan.
 
(e)           The related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement provides the sole remedies available to the Certificateholders, or the Trustee on their behalf, respecting any Document Defect or Breach with respect to any Mortgage Loan.  If, in connection with any Material Document Defect or Material Breach, the related Responsible Repurchase Party defaults on its obligations to cure such Material Document Defect or Material Breach and fails to deliver a Loss of Value Payment as provided in Section 2.03(h), as the case may be, in all material respects or to repurchase or replace the affected Mortgage Loan as contemplated by this Section 2.03, then the Master Servicer shall (and the Special Servicer may) promptly notify the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority
Subordinate Certificateholder, and the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Certificateholders.  Thereafter, the Trustee shall (and the Special Servicer may in its own name, or, as provided in Section 3.01(b) below, in the name of the Trustee) take such actions on behalf of the Trust with respect to the enforcement of such repurchase/substitution obligations, including the institution and prosecution of appropriate legal proceedings, as the Trustee (or, if applicable, the Special Servicer) shall determine are in the best interests of the Certificateholders (taken as a collective whole).  Any and all reasonable “out-of-pocket” costs and expenses incurred by the Master Servicer, the Trustee and/or the Special Servicer pursuant to this Section 2.03(e), including, reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses, to the extent not collected from the related Responsible Repurchase
Party, shall constitute Servicing Advances in respect of the affected Mortgage Loan.
 
(f)           The Trustee shall not consent to the assignment by a Mortgage Loan Seller or Responsible Repurchase Party of their respective obligations under any Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement unless such assignment is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation and, during any Subordinate Control Period, with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative, which consent shall be deemed given if the Subordinate Class Representative does not respond within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Trustee’s request.
 
(g)           If the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (each a “Repurchase Request Recipient”):  (1) receives a Repurchase Communication of a request or demand for repurchase or replacement of any Mortgage Loan alleging a Document Defect or a Breach (a “Repurchase Request”); (2) receives a Repurchase Communication of a withdrawal of a Repurchase Request by the Person making such Repurchase Request (a “Repurchase Request Withdrawal”); or (3) receives a Repurchase Communication that any Mortgage Loan that was 
 


  


-121-





  


 
subject of a Repurchase Request has been repurchased or replaced (a “Repurchase”) or that such Repurchase Request has been rejected (a “Repurchase Request Rejection”), then such party shall give written notice thereof to the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller and the other parties hereto and the Other Depositor (if applicable) promptly but in any case within ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt thereof. Each notice required by this Section 2.03(g) (a “Rule 15Ga-1 Notice”) shall include:  (i) the date that the Repurchase Communication relating to the Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection, as applicable, was received by the Repurchase Request Recipient; (ii) the identity of the Person making or withdrawing any such Repurchase Communication and the
related Mortgage Loan; (iii) in the case of a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, the basis for the Repurchase Request asserted by the Person making the Repurchase Request, to the extent known to the Repurchase Request Recipient; and (iv) in the case of a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, a statement from the Repurchase Request Recipient as to whether it currently plans to pursue such Repurchase Request pursuant to Section 2.03(b).  Each Rule 15Ga-1 Notice may be delivered by electronic means.  A Repurchase Request Recipient shall not be required to provide any information under this Section 2.03(g) if and to the extent that such information is protected by either the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrines.  Each Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement will provide that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice is provided only to assist the Depositor,
the related Mortgage Loan Seller, the Other Depositor (if applicable) and their respective Affiliates in complying with Rule 15Ga-1, Items 1104 and 1121 of Regulation AB and/or any other law or regulation, and (ii) (A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a Repurchase Request Recipient, and (B) no information provided pursuant to this Section 2.03(g) by a Repurchase Request Recipient, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any legal right the Repurchase Request Recipient may have with respect to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.
 
If the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Custodian receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection, such party shall forward such Repurchase Communication as soon as possible and in any event, no later than three (3) Business Days following receipt of such Repurchase Communication to the Master Servicer, if relating to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan, or to the Special Servicer, if relating to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property and shall include the following statement in the related correspondence:  “This is a Repurchase Communication of a [“Repurchase Request”] [“Repurchase Request Withdrawal”] [“Repurchase”] [“Repurchase Request Rejection”] under Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement relating to the WFRBS
2012-C10 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates requiring action by you as the “Repurchase Request Recipient” of such Repurchase Communication thereunder”.  Upon receipt of any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to the prior sentence, such party shall be deemed a Repurchase Request Recipient in respect of such Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection, as applicable, and such party shall comply with the procedures set forth in the prior paragraph of this Section 2.03(g) with respect to such Repurchase Communication of such Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection.  In no event shall this provision require the Custodian (in its capacity as Custodian)
in connection with its review of a Mortgage File to provide any notice

other than as set forth in Section 2.02 of this Agreement.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Custodian shall accept any oral Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, and each of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Custodian shall direct any Person making an oral Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request, Repurchase Request Withdrawal, Repurchase or Repurchase Request Rejection to submit it in writing (or by means of electronic mail in accordance with Section 12.06) to the Certificate Administrator (who will act in accordance with the first sentence of this paragraph).  Repurchase Communications of Repurchase Requests made to the Certificate Administrator must be submitted in writing or may be transmitted by electronic mail in accordance with Section 12.06 with
a subject line of “Repurchase Request – WFRBS 2012-C10”.
 
The parties hereto agree that delivery of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice shall not in and of itself constitute delivery of notice of any Material Document Defect or Material Breach or knowledge on the part of the Responsible Repurchase Party of any Material Document Defect or Material Breach.
 
(h)           If a Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party), in connection with a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach (or an allegation of a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach) pertaining to a Mortgage Loan, makes a cash payment pursuant to an agreement or a settlement between the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party) and the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust (with the consent of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder to the extent a Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period is then in effect) (each such payment, a “Loss of Value Payment”) with respect to such Mortgage Loan, the amount of such Loss of Value Payment shall be deposited into the Loss of Value Reserve Fund to be applied in accordance with Section 3.05(h) of
this Agreement.  If such Loss of Value Payment is made, the Loss of Value Payment shall serve as the sole remedy available to the Certificateholders and the Trustee on their behalf regarding any such Material Breach or Material Document Defect in lieu of any obligation of the Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party) to otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material Document Defect or repurchase or substitute for the affected Mortgage Loan based on such Material Breach or Material Document Defect under any circumstances.  This paragraph is intended to apply only to a mutual agreement or settlement between the applicable Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party)  and the Trust, provided, that prior to any such agreement or settlement nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the Mortgage Loan Seller (or, if applicable, a related Responsible Repurchase Party) or the Trustee
from exercising any of its rights related to a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach in the manner and timing set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or this Section 2.03 (excluding this paragraph) (including any right to cure, repurchase or substitute for such Mortgage Loan), and provided, further, that such Loss of Value Payment shall not be greater than the repurchase price of the affected Mortgage Loan; and provided, further that a Material Document Defect or a Material Breach as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment.

holder of such Mortgage Loans under the related Mortgage Loan Documents and in and to any related Additional Collateral; (ii) any REO Property acquired in respect of any Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the beneficial interest of the holder of the related Mortgage Loan in such REO Property); (iii) such funds and assets as from time to time are deposited in the Collection Account (but not in any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account), the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account and, if established (but, in the case of any such account established with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, subject to the rights of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders), the REO Accounts (exclusive of any such amounts that constitute Excess Servicing Fees); and (iv) the rights of the Depositor under Sections 2, 3, 4 (other than Section 4(c))

-135-





  


 
Loan in respect of which it was issued, to each Replacement Mortgage Loan (if any) substituted for such Original Mortgage Loan and to each REO Mortgage Loan deemed outstanding with respect to any REO Property acquired in respect of such Original Mortgage Loan or any such Replacement Mortgage Loan (or, in the case of any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the beneficial interest of the holder of the related Mortgage Loan in any related REO Property).  None of the REMIC I Regular Interests shall be certificated.  The REMIC I Regular Interests and the REMIC I Residual Interest shall collectively constitute the entire beneficial ownership of REMIC I.
 
(c)           The REMIC I Regular Interests shall constitute the “regular interests” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code), and the REMIC I Residual Interest shall constitute the sole “residual interest” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(2) of the Code), in REMIC I.

(d)           The designation for each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be the identification number for the related Original Mortgage Loan set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule.
 
(e)           Each REMIC I Regular Interest shall have an Uncertificated Principal Balance.  As of the Closing Date, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC I Regular Interest shall equal the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the related Original Mortgage Loan (as specified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule).  On each Distribution Date, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be permanently reduced by any distributions of principal deemed made with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(j) and shall be further adjusted in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 4.04(c).  Except as provided in the preceding sentence and except to the extent of the recovery of amounts previously allocated as a Realized Loss as a result
of the reimbursement from principal collections of Nonrecoverable Advances, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC I Regular Interest shall not otherwise be increased or reduced.  Deemed distributions to REMIC II in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously deemed allocated to a REMIC I Regular Interest, shall not constitute deemed distributions of principal and shall not result in any reduction of the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest.
 
(f)           The per annum rate at which each REMIC I Regular Interest shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period is herein referred to as its “REMIC I Remittance Rate”.  The REMIC I Remittance Rate in respect of any particular REMIC I Regular Interest, for any Interest Accrual Period, shall equal:  (A) if the related Original Mortgage Loan is or was, as the case may be, a 30/360 Mortgage Loan, the related Net Mortgage Rate then in effect (including as a result of any step-up provision) for the related Original Mortgage Loan under the original terms of such Mortgage Loan in effect as of the Closing Date (without regard to any modifications, extensions, waivers or amendments of such Mortgage Loan subsequent to the Closing Date, whether entered into by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding
involving the related Borrower) and (B) if the related Original Mortgage Loan is or was, as the case may be, an

Actual/360 Mortgage Loan, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the product of 12 times the Adjusted Actual/360 Accrued Interest Amount with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for such Interest Accrual Period, and the denominator of which is the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest immediately prior to the Distribution Date that corresponds to such Interest Accrual Period.
 
The “Adjusted Actual/360 Accrued Interest Amount” with respect to any REMIC I Regular Interest referred to in clause (B) of the second sentence of the prior paragraph, for any Interest Accrual Period, is an amount of interest equal to the product of (a) the Net Mortgage Rate then in effect (including as a result of any step-up provision) for the related Mortgage Loan under the original terms of such Mortgage Loan in effect as of the Closing Date (without regard to any modifications, extensions, waivers or amendments of such Mortgage Loan subsequent to the Closing Date, whether entered into by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or in connection with any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding involving the related Borrower), multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Interest Accrual
Period, and the denominator of which is 360, multiplied by (c) the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest immediately prior to the Distribution Date that corresponds to such Interest Accrual Period; provided that, if the subject Interest Accrual Period occurs during (x) December of any year that does not immediately precede a leap year or (y) January of any year, then the amount of interest calculated with respect to the subject REMIC I Regular Interest pursuant to this definition for such Interest Accrual Period without regard to this proviso shall be decreased by the Interest Reserve Amount, if any (and the fraction described in clause (B) of the second sentence of the preceding paragraph shall be adjusted accordingly), with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) transferred, in accordance with Section 3.04(c),
from the Distribution Account to the Interest Reserve Account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date that occurs immediately following the end of such Interest Accrual Period; and provided, further, that, if the subject Interest Accrual Period occurs during February of any year (or during any December or January preceding the month of the Final Distribution Date), then the amount of interest calculated with respect to the subject REMIC I Regular Interest pursuant to this definition for such Interest Accrual Period without regard to this proviso shall be increased by the Interest Reserve Amount(s), if any (and the fraction described in clause (B) of the second sentence of the preceding paragraph shall be adjusted accordingly), with respect to the related Mortgage Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) transferred, in accordance with Section 3.05(c),
from the Interest Reserve Account to the Distribution Account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date that occurs immediately following the end of such Interest Accrual Period.
 
(g)           Each REMIC I Regular Interest shall bear interest.  Such interest shall be calculated on a 30/360 Basis and, during each Interest Accrual Period, such interest shall accrue at the REMIC I Remittance Rate with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for such Interest Accrual Period on the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest outstanding immediately prior to the related Distribution Date.  The total amount of interest accrued with respect to each REMIC I Regular Interest during each Interest Accrual Period is referred to herein as its “Uncertificated Accrued Interest” for such Interest Accrual Period.  The portion of the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to any REMIC I Regular Interest for any Interest Accrual Period that shall be distributable to REMIC II, as the holder of such 
 


  


-137-





  


 
REMIC I Regular Interest, on the related Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(j), shall be an amount (herein referred to as the “Uncertificated Distributable Interest” with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for the related Distribution Date) equal to (i) the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period, reduced (to not less than zero) by (ii) the portion of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date that is allocable to such REMIC I Regular Interest.  For purposes of the foregoing, the Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall, if any, for each Distribution Date shall be allocated among all the REMIC I Regular Interests on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective amounts of Uncertificated Accrued Interest
for the related Interest Accrual Period.  If the entire Uncertificated Distributable Interest with respect to any REMIC I Regular Interest for any Distribution Date is not deemed distributed to REMIC II, as the holder of such REMIC I Regular Interest, on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(j), then the unpaid portion of such Uncertificated Distributable Interest shall be distributable with respect to such REMIC I Regular Interest for future Distribution Dates as provided in such Section 4.01(j).
 
(h)           Solely for purposes of satisfying Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii), the Latest Possible Maturity Date for each REMIC I Regular Interest shall be the Rated Final Distribution Date.
 
(i)            The REMIC I Residual Interest will not have a principal balance and will not bear interest.

certificated.  The REMIC II Regular Interests and the REMIC II Residual Interest shall collectively constitute the entire beneficial ownership of REMIC II.
 
(c)           The REMIC II Regular Interests shall constitute the “regular interests” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code), and the REMIC II Residual Interest shall constitute the sole “residual interest” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(2) of the Code), in REMIC II.  None of the parties hereto, to the extent it is within the control thereof, shall create or permit the creation of any other “interests” in REMIC II (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860D-1(b)(1)).

as a Realized Loss as a result of the reimbursement from principal collections of Nonrecoverable Advances, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each REMIC II Regular Interest shall not otherwise be increased or reduced.  Deemed distributions to REMIC III in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously deemed allocated to a REMIC II Regular Interest, shall not constitute deemed distributions of principal and shall not result in any reduction of the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC II Regular Interest.
 
(f)           The per annum rate at which each REMIC II Regular Interest shall accrue interest during each Interest Accrual Period is herein referred to as its “REMIC II Remittance Rate”.  The REMIC II Remittance Rate with respect to each REMIC II Regular Interest for any Interest Accrual Period shall be the WAC Rate for such Interest Accrual Period.
 
(g)           Each REMIC II Regular Interest shall bear interest.  Such interest shall be calculated on a 30/360 Basis and, during each Interest Accrual Period, such interest shall accrue at the REMIC II Remittance Rate with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for such Interest Accrual Period on the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC II Regular Interest outstanding immediately prior to the related Distribution Date.  The total amount of interest accrued with respect to each REMIC II Regular Interest during each Interest Accrual Period is referred to herein as its “Uncertificated Accrued Interest” for such Interest Accrual Period.  The portion of the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to any REMIC II Regular Interest for any Interest Accrual Period that shall be distributable to REMIC III, as the holder of such REMIC II Regular Interest, on the related Distribution Date pursuant
to Section 4.01(i), shall be an amount (herein referred to as the “Uncertificated Distributable

Interest” with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for the related Distribution Date) equal to (i) the Uncertificated Accrued Interest with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period, reduced (to not less than zero) by (ii) the portion of any Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall for such Distribution Date that is allocable to such REMIC II Regular Interest.  For purposes of the foregoing, the Net Aggregate Prepayment Interest Shortfall, if any, for each Distribution Date shall be allocated among all the REMIC II Regular Interests on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective amounts of Uncertificated Accrued Interest for the related Interest Accrual Period.  If the entire Uncertificated Distributable Interest with respect to any REMIC II Regular Interest for any Distribution Date is not deemed distributed to REMIC III, as the holder of
such REMIC II Regular Interest, on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(i), then the unpaid portion of such Uncertificated Distributable Interest shall be distributable with respect to such REMIC II Regular Interest for future Distribution Dates as provided in such Section 4.01(i).
 
(h)           Solely for purposes of satisfying Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii), the Latest Possible Maturity Date for each REMIC II Regular Interest shall be the Rated Final Distribution Date.
 
(i)            The REMIC II Residual Interest shall not have a principal balance and shall not bear interest.

Section 3.01     General Provisions.
 
(a)           Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall service and administer the Serviced Mortgage Loans, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and any Administered REO Properties that it is obligated (as provided below) to service and administer pursuant to this Agreement on behalf of the Trustee, and in the best interests and for the benefit of the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Serviced Loan Combination, of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) (as determined by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, in its good faith and reasonable judgment), as a collective whole, in accordance with any and all applicable laws, the terms of this Agreement, the terms of the respective Serviced Mortgage Loans and, in the case of the Serviced Loan Combination, the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement (provided
that, in the event the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonably exercised judgment determines that following the terms of any Mortgage Loan Document would or potentially would result in an Adverse REMIC Event (for which determination, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer will be entitled to rely on advice of counsel, the cost of which will be reimbursed as an Additional Trust Fund Expense by withdrawal from the Collection Account), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, must comply with the REMIC Provisions to the extent necessary to avoid an Adverse REMIC Event) and, to the extent consistent with the foregoing, in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  In clarification of, and neither in addition to nor in deletion of the duties and obligations of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to this Agreement, no provision herein contained shall be construed as an express or implied guarantee by the
Master Servicer or the Special Servicer of the collectability or recoverability of payments on the Mortgage Loans or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or shall be construed to impair or adversely affect any rights or benefits provided by this Agreement to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (including with respect to Master Servicing Fees or the right to be reimbursed for Advances).  Any provision in this Agreement for any Advance by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee is intended solely to provide liquidity for the benefit of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders, and not as credit support or otherwise to impose on any such Person the risk of loss with respect to one or more of the Mortgage Loans.  No provision hereof shall be construed to impose liability on the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer for the reason that any recovery to the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any
Serviced Loan Combination, to the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) in respect of a Mortgage Loan at any time after a determination of present value recovery made in its reasonable and good faith judgment in accordance with the Servicing Standard by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer hereunder at any time is less than the amount reflected in such determination.  Without limiting the foregoing, and subject to Section 3.21, (i) the Master Servicer shall service and administer all Performing Serviced Mortgage Loans and Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans, (ii) the Special Servicer shall service and administer (x) each Serviced Mortgage Loan and each Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (other than Corrected Mortgage Loans) as to which a Servicing Transfer Event has occurred, and (y) each Administered REO Property; provided, that

the Master Servicer shall continue to (A) make P&I Advances required hereunder with respect to each Mortgage Loan that constitutes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and each successor REO Mortgage Loan in respect thereof, (B) make Servicing Advances required hereunder with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties (and related REO Mortgage Loans), (C) receive payments, collect information and deliver reports to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee required hereunder with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties (and the related REO Mortgage Loans), and (D) render such incidental services with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties as and to the extent as may be specifically provided for herein.  In addition, the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer within three (3) Business Days
following its receipt of any collections on any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall within one Business Day thereafter notify the Master Servicer with instructions on how to apply such collections and the Master Servicer shall apply such collections in accordance with such instructions within one Business Day following the Master Servicer’s receipt of such notice.
 
(b)           Subject to Section 3.01(a) and the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each have full power and authority, acting alone or, subject to Section 3.22, through Sub-Servicers, to do or cause to be done any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem necessary or desirable.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer (with respect to those Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that it is obligated to service and administer pursuant to this Agreement) and the Special Servicer (with respect to the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties), in its own name or in the name of the Trustee, is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trustee
(and in the case of the Serviced Loan Combination is, pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, authorized by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Certificateholders, the Trustee (and in the case of the Serviced Loan Combination), the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, or any of them:  (i) any and all financing statements, continuation statements and other documents or instruments necessary to maintain the lien created by the Mortgage or other security document in the related Mortgage File on the related Mortgaged Property and other related collateral; (ii) any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, or of partial or full defeasance, and all other comparable instruments; and (iii) subject to Sections 3.08, 3.20 and 3.24)

modifying or releasing (or joining the Borrower therein) any easements, covenants, conditions, restrictions, equitable servitudes, or land use or zoning requirements with respect to the Mortgaged Properties, instruments relating to the custody of any collateral that now secures or hereafter may secure any Serviced Mortgage Loan and any other consents.  Subject to Section 3.10, the Trustee shall, at the written request of a Servicing Officer of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, furnish, or cause to be so furnished, to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, any limited powers of attorney substantially in the form attached as Exhibit L hereto (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the
Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable) and other documents (each of which shall be prepared by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be) necessary or appropriate to enable it to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder; provided that the Trustee shall not be held liable for any misuse of any such power of attorney by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, on or before the Closing Date, a power of attorney substantially in the form attached as Exhibit L hereto (or such other form as mutually agreed to by the Trustee and the Master Servicer or Special
Servicer, as applicable).  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall, without the Trustee’s written consent:  (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee’s name without indicating the Master Servicer’s or Special Servicer’s, as applicable, representative capacity; or (ii) take any action with the intent to cause, and that actually causes, the Trustee to be registered to do business in any state.  The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall indemnify (out of its own funds without reimbursement therefor) the Trustee for any and all costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with the negligent or willful misuse of such power of attorney by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be.
 
(c)           The Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, in accordance with this Agreement, shall service and administer each Cross-Collateralized Group as a single Mortgage Loan as and when necessary and appropriate consistent with the Servicing Standard and applicable law and in accordance with this Agreement.
 
(d)          The relationship of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer to the Trustee and, unless they are the same Person, one another under this Agreement is intended by the parties to be that of an independent contractor and not that of a joint venturer, partner or agent.
 
(e)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each of the Master Servicer’s and Special Servicer’s obligations and responsibilities hereunder and the Master Servicer’s and Special Servicer’s authority with respect to the Non-Serviced Loan Combinations and any REO Property that is not Administered REO Property is limited by and subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreements and the rights, responsibilities and obligations of the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer and the Non-Trust Trustee under the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The Master Servicer shall, to the extent directed and instructed as contemplated by Section 3.01(g), enforce the rights of the Trustee (as holder of each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) under the related Intercreditor
Agreement and the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 


  


-146-





  


 
(f)           Nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit the ability of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer to lend money to (to the extent not secured, in whole or in part, by any Mortgaged Property), accept deposits from and otherwise generally engage in any kind of business or dealings with any Borrower as though the Master Servicer or Special Servicer was not a party to this Agreement or to the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that this sentence shall not be construed to modify or supersede the Servicing Standard.
 
(g)           The parties hereto acknowledge that each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan and any REO Property that is not Administered REO Property is subject to the terms and conditions of the related Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The parties hereto recognize the respective rights and obligations of the “Initial Note Holders” and “Note Holders” under the Intercreditor Agreements for such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loans, including with respect to the allocation of collections and losses on or in respect of such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loans and the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans and the making of payments to the “Initial Note Holders” and “Note Holders” in accordance with each such Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The parties hereto further acknowledge
that, pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement(s) for each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan and any REO Property that is not Administered REO Property, each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and any REO Property that is not Administered REO Property are to be serviced and administered by the related Non-Trust Master Servicer and related Non-Trust Special Servicer in accordance with the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  Although each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan is not a Serviced Mortgage Loan hereunder, the Master Servicer hereunder for each such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall have certain duties as set forth herein and shall constitute the “Master Servicer” hereunder with respect to each such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.  The Special Servicer shall have no obligations under this Agreement for servicing any Non-Serviced Loan Combinations
or related REO Property.
 
With respect to each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, the parties to this Agreement shall have no obligation or authority to supervise respective parties to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement (but this statement shall not relieve them of liabilities they may otherwise have in their capacities as parties to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) or to make Servicing Advances with respect to any such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.  If there are at any time amounts due from the Trust, as holder of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, to any party under the related Intercreditor Agreement or the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof, the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative, and the Master Servicer shall pay such amounts out of the Collection Account.  Except as otherwise expressly
addressed in Section 3.20, if a party to the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan requests the Trustee to consent to a modification, waiver or amendment of, or other loan-level action related to, such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, then the Trustee shall promptly deliver a copy of such request to the Master Servicer to be addressed by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.20(g); provided, that, if such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan were serviced hereunder and such action would not be permitted without Rating Agency Confirmation, then the Master Servicer shall not grant such direction without first having obtained such Rating Agency 
 


  


-147-





  


 
Confirmation (payable at the expense of the party requesting such approval of the Trustee, if a Certificateholder or a party to this Agreement, otherwise from the Collection Account).  If a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives actual notice of a “servicer termination event” (or other similar term) under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then (during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period) the Trustee shall notify (in writing), and direct the Master Servicer to act in accordance with the instructions of, the Subordinate Class Representative; provided that, during a Senior Consultation Period or if such instructions are not provided within a reasonable time period (not to exceed ten (10) Business Days or such lesser response time as is afforded under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement) or if the Master Servicer is not permitted
by the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement to follow such instructions, then the Trustee shall direct the Master Servicer to take such action or inaction (to the extent permitted by the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), as directed in writing by the Holders of the Certificates entitled to a majority of the Voting Rights (such direction communicated to the Master Servicer by the Trustee) within a reasonable period of time that does not exceed such response time as is afforded under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  If the Trustee receives a request from any party to a Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement for consent to or approval of a modification, waiver or amendment of such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement, or the adoption of any servicing agreement that is the successor to and/or in replacement of such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement in effect as of the Closing
Date or a change in servicer under such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the Trustee shall not grant such consent or approval unless it receives the consent of the Master Servicer under this Agreement, the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period) and a Rating Agency Confirmation (at the expense of the party requesting such approval of the Trustee, if a Certificateholder or a party to this Agreement, otherwise from the Collection Account) from each Rating Agency to the effect that such consent or approval would not result in an Adverse Rating Event with respect to any Class of Rated Certificates.  During the continuation of any “servicer termination event” (or other similar term) under a Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, each of the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to take all actions to enforce
its rights and remedies and to protect the interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of the Trust (including the institution and prosecution of all judicial, administrative and other proceedings and the filings of proofs of claim and debt in connection therewith).  The reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in connection with such enforcement shall be an Additional Trust Fund Expense.  The Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each promptly forward all material notices or other communications delivered to it in connection with each Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement to the other such parties, the Depositor and the Subordinate Class Representative and, if such notice or communication is in the nature of a notice or communication that would be required to be delivered to the Rating Agencies if the related Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan were a Serviced Mortgage Loan, to the Rule 17g-5
Information Provider (who shall promptly post such notice to the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)).  Any obligation of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, to provide information and collections to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificateholders with respect to any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall be dependent on its receipt of the corresponding 
 


  


-148-

Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee to reimburse itself from the related trust’s general collections, then the parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge and agree that the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, may do so and the Master Servicer shall be required to, promptly following notice from the Non-Trust Master Servicer, reimburse the related trust out of general collections in the Collection Account for the Trust’s pro rata share of any such “Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances” and/or “Additional Trust Fund Expenses”;

(a)           Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall make efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard and the terms of this Agreement to collect all payments required under the terms and provisions of the respective Serviced Mortgage Loans and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan it is obligated to service hereunder (including, without limitation, all Special Servicing Fees, Workout Fees, Liquidation Fees and other fees and compensation payable to the Master Servicer and to the Special Servicer to the extent the Borrower is obligated to pay such amounts pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Documents); and shall follow such collection procedures as are consistent with the Servicing Standard; provided that the Master Servicer shall not, with respect to any Mortgage Loan that constitutes an ARD Mortgage Loan after its Anticipated Repayment Date, take any enforcement
action with respect to the payment of Post-ARD Additional Interest (other than the making of requests for its collection), and the Special Servicer may do so only if (A) such Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (B) either (i) the taking of an enforcement action with respect to the payment of other amounts due under such Mortgage Loan is, in the reasonable judgment of such Special Servicer, and without regard to such Post-ARD Additional Interest, also necessary, appropriate and consistent with the Servicing Standard or (ii) all other amounts due under such Mortgage Loan have been paid, the payment of such Post-ARD Additional Interest has not been forgiven in accordance with Section 3.20 and, in the reasonable judgment of the Special 
 


  


-150-





  


 
Servicer, exercised in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Liquidation Proceeds expected to be recovered in connection with such enforcement action will cover the anticipated costs of such enforcement action and, if applicable, any associated Post-ARD Additional Interest; provided, that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, may take action to enforce the Trust Fund’s right to apply excess cash flow to principal in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  Consistent with the foregoing, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer may grant case-by-case waivers of Default Charges in connection with a late payment on a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
(b)          At least ninety (90) days prior to the maturity date of each Balloon Mortgage Loan that is a Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall send a notice to the related Borrower of such maturity date (with a copy to be sent to the Special Servicer) and shall request confirmation that the Balloon Payment will be paid by such maturity date.
 
(c)           With respect to each Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, if the Master Servicer does not receive from a Non-Trust Master Servicer any Monthly Payment or other amounts known by the Master Servicer to be owing on a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement, then such Master Servicer shall provide notice of such failure to the related Non-Trust Master Servicer and the related Non-Trust Trustee.
 
Section 3.03     Collection of Taxes, Assessments and Similar Items; Servicing Accounts; Reserve Accounts.
 
(a)           The Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts (“Servicing Accounts”), in which all Escrow Payments received by it with respect to the Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, shall be deposited and retained, separate and apart from its own funds.  Subject to any terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents that specify the nature of the account in which Escrow Payments shall be held, each Servicing Account shall be an Eligible Account.  As and to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan Documents, the Master Servicer may make withdrawals from the Servicing Accounts maintained by it, and may apply Escrow Payments held therein with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (together with interest earned thereon), only as follows:  (i) to
effect the payment of real estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums (including, premiums on any Environmental Insurance Policy), ground rents (if applicable) and comparable items in respect of the related Mortgaged Property; (ii) to reimburse the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, for any unreimbursed Servicing Advances made thereby with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to cover any of the items described in the immediately preceding clause (i); (iii) to refund to the related Borrower any sums as may be determined to be overages; (iv) to pay interest or other income, if required and as described below, to the related Borrower on balances in the Servicing Account (or, if and to the extent not payable to the related Borrower to pay such interest or other income (up to the amount of any Net Investment Earnings in respect of such Servicing Account for each Collection Period)
to the Master Servicer); (v) disburse Insurance Proceeds if required to be applied to the repair or restoration of the related Mortgaged Property, (vi) after an event of default, to pay the principal 
 


  


-151-





  


 
of, accrued interest on and any other amounts payable with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; (vii) to withdraw amounts deposited in the Servicing Account in error; or (viii) to clear and terminate the Servicing Account at the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01.  The Master Servicer shall pay or cause to be paid to the related Borrowers interest and other income, if any, earned on the investment of funds in Servicing Accounts maintained thereby, if and to the extent required by law or the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  If the Master Servicer shall deposit in a Servicing Account maintained by it any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such amount from such Servicing Account, any provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding.  Promptly after
any Escrow Payments are received by the Special Servicer from the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, and in any event within one Business Day after any such receipt, the Special Servicer shall remit such Escrow Payments to the Master Servicer for deposit in the applicable Servicing Account(s).
 
(b)           The Master Servicer shall as to each Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (including each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan):  (i) maintain accurate records with respect to the related Mortgaged Property reflecting the status of real estate taxes, assessments and other similar items that are or may become a lien thereon and the status of insurance premiums and any ground rents payable in respect thereof and (ii) use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such items (including renewal premiums) and effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date.  For purposes of effecting any such payment with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Master Servicer shall apply Escrow Payments as allowed under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents; provided
that if such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan does not require the related Borrower to escrow for the payment of real estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, ground rents (if applicable) and similar items, the Master Servicer (or, if such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer) shall, subject to and in accordance with the Servicing Standard, use reasonable efforts to enforce the requirement of the related Mortgage Loan Documents that the related Borrower make payments in respect of such items at the time they first become due.
 
(c)           In accordance with the Servicing Standard, but subject to Section 3.11(h), the Master Servicer, with respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu  Companion Loan (including each such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall make a Servicing Advance with respect to the related Mortgaged Property in an amount equal to all such funds as are necessary for the purpose of effecting the timely payment of (i) real estate taxes, assessments and other similar items, (ii) ground rents (if applicable), and (iii) premiums on Insurance Policies (including, premiums on any Environmental Insurance Policy), in each instance prior to the applicable penalty or termination date, in each instance if and to the extent that (x) Escrow Payments (if any) collected from the related Borrower are insufficient
to pay such item when due, and (y) the related Borrower has failed to pay such item on a timely basis; provided that, in the case of amounts described in the preceding clause (i), the Master Servicer shall not make a Servicing Advance of any such amount if the Master Servicer reasonably anticipates (in accordance with the Servicing Standard) that such amounts will be paid by the related Borrower on or before the applicable 
 


  


-152-





  


 
penalty date, in which case the Master Servicer shall use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to confirm whether such amounts have been paid and, subject to Section 3.11(h), shall make a Servicing Advance of such amounts, if necessary, not later than five (5) Business Days following confirmation by the Master Servicer that such amounts have not been paid by the applicable penalty date.  All such Advances shall be reimbursable in the first instance from related collections from the Borrowers and further as provided in Section 3.05(a).  No costs incurred by the Master Servicer in effecting the payment of real estate taxes, assessments and, if applicable, ground rents on or in respect of any Mortgaged Property shall, for purposes hereof, including calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders, be added to the respective
unpaid principal balances or Stated Principal Balances of the subject Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan so permit; provided that this sentence shall not be construed to limit the rights of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust to enforce any obligations of the related Borrower under such Mortgage Loan.
 
(d)           The Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts (“Reserve Accounts”), in which all Reserve Funds, if any, received by it with respect to the Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, shall be deposited and retained, separate and apart from its own funds.  Subject to any terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents that specify the nature of the account in which Reserve Funds shall be held, each Reserve Account shall be an Eligible Account.  As and to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan Documents, the Master Servicer may make withdrawals from the Reserve Accounts maintained by it, and may apply Reserve Funds held therein with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (together with interest earned thereon), only as follows:  (i) in
the case of Reserve Funds that are intended to cover specific costs and expenses, to pay for, or to reimburse the related Borrower in connection with, the costs associated with the related tenant improvements, leasing commissions, repairs, replacements, capital improvements and/or environmental testing and remediation, litigation and/or other special expenses at or with respect to the related Mortgaged Property for which such Reserve Funds were intended and to refund the related Borrower any sums as may be determined to be overages; (ii) in the case of Reserve Funds intended to cover debt service payments, to apply amounts on deposit therein in respect of principal and interest on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; (iii) to reimburse the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, for any unreimbursed Advances made thereby with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to cover any of the items
described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) (or, if any such Advance has become an Unliquidated Advance, to transfer to the Collection Account an amount equal to the reimbursement that would otherwise have been made as described in this clause (iii)); (iv) subject to Section 3.20, to release such Reserve Funds to the related Borrower if the conditions precedent for such release are satisfied or otherwise apply such Reserve Funds in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Documents if the conditions precedent for such release are not satisfied; (v) to pay interest or other income, if required and as described below, to the related Borrower on balances in the Reserve Account (or, if and to the extent not payable to the related Borrower, to pay such interest or other income (up to the amount of any Net Investment Earnings
in respect of such Reserve Account for each Collection Period) to the Master Servicer); (vi) to withdraw amounts deposited in such Reserve Account in error; (vii) after an event of default, to pay the principal of, accrued interest on, and 
 


  


-153-





  


 
any other amounts payable with respect to such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; or (viii) to clear and terminate the Reserve Account at the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01.  If the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan delivers a Letter of Credit in lieu of Reserve Funds, then the Master Servicer, subject to Section 3.20, shall make draws on or reduce the amount of such Letter of Credit at such times and for such purposes as it would have made withdrawals from or reductions of the amount of a Reserve Account and, to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, applicable law and the related Mortgage Loan Documents, in order to convert the amount of such Letter of Credit into Reserve Funds.  Promptly
after any Reserve Funds are received by the Special Servicer from any Borrower, and in any event within one Business Day of such receipt, the Special Servicer shall remit such Reserve Funds to the Master Servicer for deposit in the applicable Reserve Account(s).  Any out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses, incurred by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to enable the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, to make any draw under any Letter of Credit shall constitute a Servicing Advance, and the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall make reasonable efforts to recover such expenses from the related Borrower to the extent the Borrower is required to pay such expenses under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
(e)           To the extent an operations and maintenance plan is required to be established and executed pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents for a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Master Servicer shall request from the related Borrower written confirmation thereof within a reasonable time after the later of the Closing Date and the date as of which such plan is required to be established or completed.  To the extent any other action or remediation with respect to environmental matters is required to have been taken or completed pursuant to the terms of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Master Servicer shall request from the related Borrower written confirmation of such action and remediation within a reasonable time after the later of the Closing Date and the date as of which such action or remediation are required to have
been taken or completed.  To the extent that a Borrower shall fail to promptly respond to any inquiry described in this Section 3.03(e), the Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and (if affected) the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).  The Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and any affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders if the Master Servicer determines that the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan has failed to perform its obligations under such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in respect of environmental matters.
 
(f)           Subject to applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, funds in the Servicing Accounts and the Reserve Accounts may be invested only in Permitted Investments in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.06.
 
(g)           With respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that requires the related Borrower to establish and maintain one or more lock-box, cash management or similar accounts, the Master Servicer shall establish and maintain, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, such account(s) in accordance with the terms of the 
 


  


-154-

(viii)       insofar as they do not constitute Escrow Payments or Reserve Funds, any amounts relating to such Mortgage Loans paid by a Borrower specifically to cover items for which a Servicing Advance has been made or that represent a recovery of property protection expenses from a Borrower; and
 
(ix)          any Loss of Value Payments, as set forth in Section 3.05(h) of this Agreement.
 
Furthermore, the Master Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account any amounts required to be deposited by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.06, as and when required by such section, in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Collection Account.

-156-





  


 
such check to the order of the Master Servicer (in its capacity as such), without recourse, representation or warranty, unless the Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item cannot be so endorsed and delivered because of a restrictive endorsement.  Any such amounts received by the Special Servicer with respect to an Administered REO Property shall be deposited by the Special Servicer into the related REO Account and remitted to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.16(c).

one of which sub-accounts shall be the “Class A-FX/A-FL Distribution Account” which shall be deemed to be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates.  Not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Master Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator, for deposit in the Distribution Account, an aggregate amount of immediately available funds equal to the Master Servicer Remittance Amount for the Master Servicer Remittance Date.  In addition, the Master Servicer shall, as and when required hereunder, deliver to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in the Distribution Account any P&I Advances and Compensating Interest Payments required to be made by the Master Servicer hereunder.  Furthermore, any amounts paid by any party hereto to indemnify the Trust Fund pursuant to any provision hereof shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator for deposit in
the Distribution Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall, upon receipt, deposit in the Distribution Account any and all amounts received or, pursuant to Section 4.03, advanced by the Trustee that are required by the terms of this Agreement to be deposited therein.  As and when required pursuant to Section 3.05(c), the Certificate Administrator shall transfer Interest Reserve Amounts in respect of the Interest Reserve Loans from the Interest Reserve Account to the Distribution Account.  Furthermore, as and when required pursuant to Section 3.05(d), the Certificate Administrator shall transfer monies from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account to the Distribution Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall also deposit in the Distribution Account any amounts required to be deposited by the Certificate Administrator pursuant

REMIC Sub-Account, except that (a) any 
 


  


-157-





  


 
portion of a Master Servicer Remittance Amount that represents any Post-ARD Additional Interest related to the ARD Mortgage Loans and/or any successor REO Mortgage Loans with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been deposited into the Class V Sub-Account and (b) any amounts deposited into the Distribution Account by the Certificate Administrator pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Distribution Account shall be deemed to have been deposited into the Class V Sub-Account insofar as the losses were incurred in respect of investments of amounts on deposit in the Class V Sub-Account.
 
(c)           The Certificate Administrator shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the “Interest Reserve Account”) to be held on behalf and in the name of the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each account that constitutes the Interest Reserve Account shall be an Eligible Account or a sub-account of the Distribution Account.  On the Distribution Date in January (except during a leap year) and February of each calendar year, commencing in 2013, prior to any distributions being made with respect to the Certificates on such Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall, with respect to each Interest Reserve Loan, withdraw from the Distribution Account and deposit in the Interest Reserve Account an amount equal to the Interest Reserve Amount, if any, in respect of such Interest Reserve Loan for such Distribution Date; provided
that no such transfer of monies from the Distribution Account to the Interest Reserve Account shall be made on the Final Distribution Date.  The Certificate Administrator shall also deposit in the Interest Reserve Account from its own funds any amounts required to be deposited by the Certificate Administrator pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Interest Reserve Account.
 
Notwithstanding that the Interest Reserve Account may be a sub-account of the Distribution Account for reasons of administrative convenience, the Interest Reserve Account and the Distribution Account shall, for all purposes of this Agreement (including the obligations and responsibilities of the Certificate Administrator hereunder), be considered to be and shall be required to be treated as, separate and distinct accounts.
 
(d)           If any Excess Liquidation Proceeds are received, the Certificate Administrator shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the “Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account”) to be held on behalf and in the name of the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders.  Each account that constitutes the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account shall be an Eligible Account (or a separately identified sub-account of the Distribution Account, provided that for all purposes of this Agreement (including the obligations of the Certificate Administrator hereunder) such account shall be considered to be and shall be required to be treated as separate and distinct from the Distribution Account).  On the Master Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall withdraw from the Collection Account and remit to the Certificate Administrator for
deposit in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account all Excess Liquidation Proceeds received by it during the Collection Period ending on the Determination Date immediately prior to the Master Servicer Remittance Date.  The Certificate Administrator shall also deposit in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account from its own funds any amounts required to be deposited by the Certificate Administrator pursuant to Section 3.06 in connection with losses incurred with respect to Permitted Investments of funds held in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account.

(e)           On or before the Closing Date, the Certificate Administrator (on behalf of the Trustee) shall establish and maintain the Class A-FX/A-FL Distribution Account as a sub-account of the Distribution Account.  The Class A-FX/A-FL Distribution Account shall have the following two sub-accounts:  (i) a sub-account (the “Class A-FL Sub-Account”), which shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates and the Swap Counterparty, as their interests may appear, and (ii) a sub-account (the “Class A-FX Sub-Account”), which shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Class A-FX Certificates.  The Class A-FX/A-FL Distribution Account shall be established and maintained as an Eligible Account or a subaccount of an Eligible Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall make or be deemed to have made deposits in and
withdrawals from the Class A-FX/A-FL Distribution Account in accordance with Section 3.05, Section 4.01(b) and Section 4.01(c), as applicable.
 
(f)           Funds in the Collection Account, the Distribution Account, the Interest Reserve Account, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodian Account, the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account and the Class A-FX/A-FL Distribution Account may be invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.06.  The Master Servicer shall give notice to the other parties hereto of the location of the Collection Account as of the Closing Date and of the new location of the Collection Account prior to any change thereof.

and not an asset of any REMIC Pool.  Furthermore, for all federal tax purposes, the Certificate Administrator shall (i) treat amounts paid out of the Loss of Value Reserve Fund through the Collection Account to the Certificateholders as damages paid to and distributed by the REMIC Pools on account of a breach of a representation or warranty by the related Mortgage Loan Seller and (ii) treat any amounts paid out of the Loss of Value Reserve Fund through the Collection Account to a Mortgage Loan Seller as distributions by the Trust Fund to such Mortgage Loan Seller as beneficial owner of the Loss of Value Reserve Fund.  The applicable Mortgage Loan Seller will be the beneficial owner of the related account in the Loss of Value Reserve Fund for all federal income tax purposes, and shall be taxable on all income earned thereon.
 
(h)           The Master Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received by it in connection with the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan separate and apart from its own funds and general assets.  In connection therewith, the Master Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more segregated accounts (each, a “Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account”), in which the funds described below are to be deposited and held on behalf of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (and which accounts may be maintained as separately identified sub-accounts of the Collection Account,

provided that for all purposes of this Agreement (including the obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder) such accounts shall be considered to be and shall be required to be treated as separate and distinct from the Collection Account).  The Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account shall be an Eligible Account or a sub-account of an Eligible Account.  The Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, within one Business Day of receipt by it or as otherwise required hereunder, the following payments and collections received or made by or on behalf of the Master Servicer in respect of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan subsequent to the Closing Date:

(vii)        any amounts required to be transferred to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account from the related REO Account pursuant to Section 3.16(c); and
 
(viii)       any other amounts received and applied on the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements, the Master Servicer need not deposit into the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account any amount that the Master Servicer would be authorized to withdraw immediately from the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account in accordance with the terms of Section 3.05 and shall be entitled to instead pay such amount directly to the Person(s) entitled thereto.

unless the Special Servicer determines, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that a particular item cannot be so endorsed and delivered because of a restrictive endorsement or because of another appropriate reason that is consistent with the Servicing Standard.  Any such amounts received by the Special Servicer with respect to an Administered REO Property relating to the applicable Serviced Loan Combination shall be deposited by the Special Servicer into the related REO Account and, insofar as such amounts are allocable as interest on, principal of, or Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges with respect to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto, shall be remitted to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.16(c) (subject to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement).  Any remittances

The Master Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting records, on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis when appropriate, in connection with any withdrawal from the Collection Account pursuant to any of clauses (ii) through (xviii) of the first paragraph of this Section 3.05(a)(I).

applicable, on the first Business Day following the immediately preceding Determination Date, describing the item and amount to which the Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Master Servicer, the Non-Trust Special Servicer, the Non-Trust Certificate Administrator or the Non-Trust Trustee, as applicable, is entitled.  The Master Servicer may rely conclusively on any such certificate and shall have no duty to re-calculate the amounts stated therein.  The Special Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting for each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and REO Property as to which it is the Special Servicer on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis, for the purpose of justifying any request thereby for withdrawal from the Collection Account.
 
Subsection (II).  The provisions of this subsection (II) of this Section 3.05(a) shall apply notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) of this Section 3.05(a):
 
(i)            Identification of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts:  If any Advance made with respect to any Mortgage Loan on or before the date on which such Mortgage Loan becomes (or, but for the making of three monthly payments under its modified terms, would then constitute) a Corrected Mortgage Loan, together with (to the extent theretofore accrued and unpaid) Advance Interest thereon, is not pursuant to the operation of the provisions of Section 3.05(a)(I) reimbursed to the Person who made such Advance on or before the date, if any, on which such Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan (or, but for the making of three monthly payments under its modified terms, would constitute a Mortgage Loan that is a Corrected Mortgage Loan), such Advance, together with such Advance Interest, shall constitute a “Workout-Delayed
Reimbursement Amount” to the extent that such amount has not been determined to constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.  All references herein to “Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount” shall be construed always to mean the related Advance and (to the extent theretofore accrued and unpaid) any Advance Interest thereon, together with (to the extent it remains unpaid) any further Advance Interest that accrues on the unreimbursed portion of such Advance from time to time in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.  That any amount constitutes all or a portion of any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount shall not in any manner limit the right of any Person hereunder to determine that such amount instead constitutes a Nonrecoverable Advance.
 
(ii)           General Relationship of Provisions.  Subsection (iii) below (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations thereof) sets forth the terms of and conditions to the right of a Person to be reimbursed for any Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount to the extent that such Person is not otherwise entitled to reimbursement and payment of such Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount pursuant to the operation of Section 3.05(a)(I) above (construed without regard to the reference therein to this subsection except that it is nonetheless hereby acknowledged that, for purposes of “Late Collections” in subsection 3.05(a)(I), funds received on the related Mortgage Loan shall be applied in accordance
with the terms of the applicable modification even though such application may result in an Advance continuing to be outstanding when the Borrower is current in its payments under the terms of the Mortgage Loan as modified).  Subsection (iv) below (subject to the terms, conditions and limitations thereof) authorizes or permits the Master Servicer, under certain circumstances, to abstain from reimbursing itself (or, if 
 


  


-168-





  


 
applicable, the Trustee to abstain from obtaining reimbursement) for Nonrecoverable Advances at its sole option.  Upon any determination that all or any portion of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount constitutes a Nonrecoverable Advance, then the reimbursement or payment of such amount (and any further Advance Interest that may accrue thereon) shall cease to be subject to the operation of subsection (iii) below, such amount (and further Advance Interest) shall be as fully payable and reimbursable to the relevant Person as would any other Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) and, as a Nonrecoverable Advance, such amount may become the subject of the Master Servicer’s (or, if applicable, the Trustee’s) exercise of its sole option authorized by subsection (iv) below.
 
(iii)          Reimbursements of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts:  The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee, as applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement and payment (and, notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) above, shall be entitled to withdraw and pay to itself the amount of such reimbursement and payment) for all Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts in each Collection Period (and it is again hereby acknowledged that, for purposes of “Late Collections” in subsection 3.05(a)(I), funds received on the related Mortgage Loan shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the applicable modification even though such application may result in an Advance continuing to be outstanding when the Borrower is current in its
payments under the terms of the Mortgage Loan as modified); provided, that the aggregate amount (for all such Persons collectively) of such reimbursements and payments from amounts advanced or collected on the Mortgage Pool in such Collection Period shall not exceed (and the reimbursement and payment shall be made from) the aggregate principal portions of P&I Advances and principal collections and recoveries on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of “Unadjusted Principal Distribution Amount”, net of the aggregate deduction amounts for Nonrecoverable Advances (and accrued and unpaid Advance Interest thereon) that were reimbursed or paid during the related Collection Period from principal collections on the Mortgage Pool, as described by clause (II)(B) of the definition of “Principal Distribution Amount”
and pursuant to subsection (iv) of this Section 3.05(a)(II).  As and to the extent provided in clause (II)(A) of the definition thereof, the Principal Distribution Amount for the Distribution Date related to such Collection Period shall be reduced to the extent that such payment or reimbursement of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount is made from aggregate principal collections pursuant to the preceding sentence.
 
Any collections (as applied under Section 1.03) received on or in respect of the Mortgage Loans during a Collection Period that, in each case, represents a delinquent amount as to which an Advance had been made, which Advance was previously reimbursed during the Collection Period for a prior Distribution Date as part of a Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amount, shall be added to and constitute a part of the Principal Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date (pursuant to clause (I)(B) of the definition of “Principal Distribution Amount”) to the extent of all Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts on or in respect of such respective Mortgage Loan that were reimbursed from collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool in all prior Collection Periods pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

The Certificate Administrator (and, with respect to Advances made by the Master Servicer or the Trustee) shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any direction or notice received from the Master Servicer in connection with any determination made by the Master Servicer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05(a)(II)(iii) and shall not be obligated to independently verify, monitor or oversee any such determination.
 
(iv)         Sole Option to Abstain from Reimbursements of Certain Nonrecoverable Advances.  To the extent that Section 3.05(a)(I) entitles the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee to reimbursement for any Nonrecoverable Advance (or payment of Advance Interest thereon from a source other than Default Charges on the related Mortgage Loan) during any Collection Period, then, notwithstanding any contrary provision of subsection (I) above, (a) to the extent that one or more such reimbursements and payments of Nonrecoverable Advances (and such Advance Interest thereon) are made, they shall be made, first, from the aggregate principal portions of P&I Advances and principal collections and recoveries on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period contemplated
by clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of “Unadjusted Principal Distribution Amount”, and then from other amounts advanced or collected on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period; provided that, if so provided as set forth below, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall provide each Rating Agency with at least fifteen (15) days’ notice before any reimbursement shall be made of a Nonrecoverable Advance (or payment of Advance Interest thereon from a source other than Default Charges on the related Mortgage Loan from such other amounts advanced or collected on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period, and (b) if and to the extent that the amount of such a Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), together with all Nonrecoverable Advances (and Advance Interest thereon) theretofore reimbursed during such Collection Period, would exceed
the aggregate principal portions of P&I Advances and principal collections and recoveries on the Mortgage Pool for such Collection Period contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of the definition of “Unadjusted Principal Distribution Amount”, the Master Servicer and/or the Trustee, as applicable, if it made the relevant Advance) is hereby authorized (but shall not be construed to have any obligation whatsoever), if it elects at its sole option and in its sole discretion, to abstain from reimbursing itself or obtaining reimbursement (notwithstanding that it is entitled to such reimbursement) during that Collection Period for all or a portion of such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), for successive one-month periods for a total period not to exceed twelve (12) months; provided that any such deferral exceeding six (6) months shall require (during a Subordinate Control Period)
the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative; provided, further, that the aggregate amount that is the subject of the exercise of such option with respect to all Nonrecoverable Advances (and Advance Interest thereon) with respect to all Mortgage Loans for any particular Collection Period is less than or equal to such excess described above in this clause (b).  If the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) makes such an election at its sole option to defer reimbursement with respect to all or a portion of a Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon), then such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) or portion thereof shall continue to be fully reimbursable in any subsequent Collection Period.  In connection with a potential election by the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to abstain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable

Advance or portion thereof during the Collection Period for any Distribution Date, the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) shall further be authorized to wait for principal collections to be received before making its determination of whether to abstain from the reimbursement of a particular Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof.  The Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall give the Rating Agencies at least fifteen (15) days’ notice (subject to Section 3.27) prior to any reimbursement to it of Nonrecoverable Advances from amounts in the Collection Account or Distribution Account, as applicable, allocable to interest on the Mortgage Loans unless (1) the Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, determines in its sole discretion that waiting fifteen (15) days after such a notice could jeopardize its ability to recover such Nonrecoverable Advances,
(2) changed circumstances or new or different information becomes known to the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, that could affect or cause a determination of whether any Advance is a Nonrecoverable Advance or whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance or the determination in clause (1) above, or (3) the Master Servicer has not timely received from the Trustee information requested by the Master Servicer to consider in determining whether to defer reimbursement of a Nonrecoverable Advance; provided, that, if any of clause (1), clause (2) or clause (3) above apply, the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, shall give each Rating Agency notice (subject to Section 3.27) of an anticipated reimbursement to it of Nonrecoverable Advances from amounts in the Collection Account or Distribution
Account, as applicable, allocable to interest on the Mortgage Loans as soon as reasonably practicable in such circumstances.  The Master Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall have no liability for any loss, liability or expenses resulting from any notice provided to the Rating Agencies contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.
 
Any collections (as applied under Section 1.03) received on the Mortgage Loans during a Collection Period that, in each case, represents a recovery of an amount determined in a prior Collection Period to have been a Nonrecoverable Advance shall be added to and constitute a part of the Principal Distribution Amount for the related Distribution Date (pursuant to clause (I)(C) of the definition of “Principal Distribution Amount”) to the extent of all Nonrecoverable Advances on such respective Mortgage Loan that were reimbursed from collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool in all prior Collection Periods pursuant to the preceding paragraph.
 
None of the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall have any liability whatsoever for making an election, or refraining from making an election, that is authorized under this subsection (II)(iv).  The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to limit any liability that may otherwise be imposed on such Person for any failure by such Person to comply with the conditions to making such an election under this subsection (II)(iv) or to comply with the terms of this subsection (II)(iv) and the other provisions of this Agreement that apply once such an election, if any, has been made.
 
Any election by the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to abstain from reimbursing itself for any Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon) or portion thereof with respect to any Collection Period shall not be construed to impose on the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) any obligation to make such an election (or any entitlement in favor of any Certificateholder or any other Person to such an election) with respect 
 


  


-171-





  


 
to any subsequent Collection Period or to constitute a waiver or limitation on the right of the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to otherwise be reimbursed for such Nonrecoverable Advance (and Advance Interest thereon).  Any such election by one of the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall not be construed to impose any duty on any other such party to make such an election (or any entitlement in favor of any Certificateholder or any other Person to such an election).  Any such election by any such party to abstain from reimbursing itself or obtaining reimbursement for any Nonrecoverable Advance or portion thereof with respect to any one or more Collection Periods shall not limit the accrual of Advance Interest on such Nonrecoverable Advance for the period prior to the actual reimbursement of such Nonrecoverable Advance.  None of the Master Servicer, the Trustee or the other parties to this Agreement shall have any liability
to one another or to any of the Certificateholders or any of the Companion Loan Holders for any such election that such party makes to defer or not to defer reimbursement as contemplated by this subsection or for any losses, damages or other adverse economic or other effects that may arise from such an election, nor shall such election constitute a violation of the Servicing Standard or any duty under this Agreement.  The foregoing statements in this paragraph shall not limit the generality of the statements made in the immediately preceding paragraph.
 
The Certificate Administrator (and, with respect to Advances made by the Master Servicer and the Trustee) shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon any direction or notice received from the Master Servicer in connection with any determination made by the Master Servicer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.05(a)(II)(iv) and shall not be obligated to independently verify, monitor or oversee any such determination.
 
(v)          Deferral is Not Subordination.  No determination by the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to exercise its sole option to defer the reimbursement of Advances and/or Advance Interest under subsection (iv) shall be construed as an agreement by the Master Servicer (or the Trustee, as applicable) to subordinate (in respect of realizing losses), to any Class of Certificates, such party’s right to such reimbursement during such period of deferral.
 
(b)           The Certificate Administrator shall, from time to time, make withdrawals from the Distribution Account for each of the following purposes (the order set forth below not constituting an order of priority for such withdrawals):

(v)           to pay for the cost of the Opinions of Counsel as contemplated by Section 12.01(a) or Section 12.01(c) in connection with any amendment to this Agreement requested by the Trustee or the Certificate Administrator which amendment is in furtherance of the rights and interests of Certificateholders;

(d)           On the Business Day prior to each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account and deposit in the Distribution Account, for distribution on such Distribution Date, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the entire amount of Excess Liquidation Proceeds, if any, then on deposit in the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account and (ii) the excess, if any, of the aggregate amount distributable on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(a), over the Available Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date (calculated without regard to such transfer from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account to the Distribution Account); provided that on the Business Day prior to the Final Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Excess Liquidation Proceeds

(e)           The Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall in all cases have a right prior to the Certificateholders to any particular funds on deposit in the Collection Account and the Distribution Account from time to time for the reimbursement or payment of compensation, Advances (with interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate) and their respective expenses hereunder, but only if and to the extent such compensation, Advances (with such interest) and expenses are to be reimbursed or paid from such particular funds on deposit in the Collection Account or the Distribution Account pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement.

(x)           consistent with any notice required to be given thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the last day such Permitted Investment may otherwise mature hereunder in an amount at least equal to the lesser of (1) all amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the amount required to be withdrawn on such date; and
 
                (y)          demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon determination by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator, as the case may be, that such Permitted Investment would not constitute a

Permitted Investment in respect of funds thereafter on deposit in such Investment Account.
 
(b)           Whether or not the Master Servicer directs the investment of funds in any Investment Account (other than a Servicing Account or Reserve Account) maintained by it, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for such Investment Account for each Collection Period, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Master Servicer and shall be subject to its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.05.  Whether or not the Master Servicer directs the investment of funds in any Servicing Account or Reserve Account maintained by it, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for such Investment Account for each Collection Period, and subject to the requirements of applicable law
or the terms of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan(s) or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s) regarding the payment of such interest and investment income to the related Borrower, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Master Servicer and shall be subject to withdrawal from time to time in accordance with Section 3.03.  Whether or not the Special Servicer directs the investment of funds in the REO Account or the Loss of Value Reserve Fund, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for such Investment Account for each Collection Period, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Special Servicer and shall be subject to its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.16(b).  Whether or not the Certificate Administrator directs the investment of funds in the Distribution Account (including,
without limitation, the Class A-FL Sub-Account), the Interest Reserve Account or the Excess Liquidation Proceeds Account, interest and investment income realized on funds deposited therein, to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, for each such Investment Account for each Collection Period, shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Certificate Administrator and shall be subject to its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.05.  If any loss shall be incurred in respect of any Permitted Investment on deposit in any Investment Account, the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator), shall promptly deposit therein from its own funds, without right of reimbursement, no later than the end of the Collection Period during which such loss was incurred, the amount of the Net Investment
Loss, if any, in respect of such Investment Account for such Collection Period (except, in the case of any such loss with respect to a Servicing Account or Reserve Account, to the extent the loss amounts were invested for the benefit of a Borrower under the terms of a Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or applicable law).
 
(c)           Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, if any default occurs in the making of any payment due (or in any other performance required) under any Permitted Investment of funds on deposit in any Investment Account, and if the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator) is in default of its obligations under or contemplated by Section 3.06(b), the Trustee may and, subject to Section 8.02, upon the request of (i) Holders of Certificates entitled to not less than 25% of the Voting Rights allocated to any Class of Interest Only Certificates or Principal Balance Certificates or (ii) the Subordinate Class Representative or (iii) alternatively, but only if the Permitted Investment involves funds
on deposit in a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion

Loan Holder(s) (it being understood that, for purposes of this clause (iii), Section 8.02 shall be construed as if references therein to one or more “Certificateholders” were instead references to such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder), the Trustee shall, take such action as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including the institution and prosecution of appropriate legal proceedings.  Any costs incurred by the Trustee in taking any such action shall be reimbursed to it by the party hereunder that maintains such Investment Account (whether it is the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator).  This provision is in no way intended to limit any actions that the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator may take in this regard at its own expense.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding the investment of funds held in any Investment Account, for purposes of the calculations hereunder, including the calculation of the Available Distribution Amount, the Master Servicer Remittance Amounts and the monthly amounts payable to the respective Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders, the amounts so invested shall be deemed to remain on deposit in such Investment Account.
 
Section 3.07     Maintenance of Insurance Policies; Errors and Omissions and Fidelity Coverage.
 
(a)           In the case of each Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Borrower to maintain (including identifying the extent to which a Borrower is maintaining insurance coverage and, if such Borrower does not so maintain, the Master Servicer will itself cause to be maintained with Qualified Insurers having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings) for the related Mortgaged Property (x) a fire and casualty extended coverage insurance policy, which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the full replacement cost of improvements securing such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or (ii) the outstanding principal balance of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to
avoid the application of any co-insurance clause and (y) all other insurance coverage (including but not limited to coverage for damage resulting from acts of terrorism) as is required or that the lender is entitled to reasonably require, subject to applicable law, under the related Mortgage Loan Documents; provided that all of the following conditions and/or limitations shall apply:
 
(A)           the Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain any earthquake or environmental insurance policy on any Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination unless such insurance policy was in effect at the time of the origination of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents and is available at commercially reasonable rates and the Trustee has an insurable interest;
 
(B)           if and to the extent that any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination grants the lender thereunder any discretion (by way of consent, approval or otherwise) as to the insurance provider from whom the related Borrower is to obtain the requisite insurance coverage, the Master Servicer shall 
 


  


-181-





  


 
(to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard) use efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the related Borrower to obtain the requisite insurance coverage from Qualified Insurers that, in each case, have the Required Claims-Paying Ratings at the time such insurance coverage is obtained;
 
(C)           the Master Servicer shall have no obligation beyond using its reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to cause the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan to maintain the insurance required to be maintained or that the lender is entitled to reasonably require, subject to applicable law, under the related Mortgage Loan Documents;
 
(D)           in no event shall the Master Servicer be required to cause the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan to maintain, or itself obtain, insurance coverage that the Master Servicer has determined is either (i) not available at any rate or (ii) not available at commercially reasonable rates and the related hazards are not at the time commonly insured against at the then-available rates for properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property and located in or around the region in which the related Mortgaged Property is located;
 
(E)           the reasonable efforts of the Master Servicer to cause the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan to maintain insurance shall be conducted in a manner that takes into account the insurance that would then be available to the Master Servicer on a force-placed basis; and
 
(F)           to the extent the Master Servicer itself is required to maintain insurance that the Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan does not maintain, the Master Servicer shall not be required to maintain insurance other than what is available to the Master Servicer on a force-placed basis (and this will not be construed to modify the other limits set forth in clause (D) above).
 
Notwithstanding the limitation set forth in clause (D) above, if the related Borrower under any Serviced Mortgage Loan fails to maintain with respect to the related Mortgaged Property (i) specific casualty insurance coverage providing for “special” form coverage that does not specifically exclude, terrorist or similar acts, and/or (ii) specific insurance coverage with respect to damages or casualties caused by terrorist or similar acts, the Master Servicer shall cause the related Borrower to maintain, or itself obtain, such insurance upon terms not materially less favorable than those in place as of the Closing Date, unless the Special Servicer has determined in its reasonable judgment based on inquiry consistent with the Servicing Standard, and (during any Subordinate Control Period) with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative or (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior
Consultation Period) after having consulted with the Trust Advisor and (during any Collective Consultation Period) the Subordinate Class Representative, that either (a) such insurance is not available at commercially reasonable rates and that such hazards are not at the time commonly insured against for properties similar to the related Mortgaged Property and located in or around the region in which such related Mortgaged Property is located, or (b) such insurance is not available at any rate (failure to maintain required insurance due to either of clause (a) or (b) is referred to herein as an “Acceptable Insurance Default”).  The Subordinate Class Representative 
 


  


-182-





  


 
and/or Trust Advisor, as applicable, will have no more than thirty (30) days to respond to the Special Servicer’s request for such consent or consultation; provided, that upon the Special Servicer’s determination, consistent with the Servicing Standard, that exigent circumstances do not allow the Special Servicer to consult with the Subordinate Class Representative and/or Trust Advisor, the Special Servicer will not be required to do so.  If any such approval of the Special Servicer has not been expressly denied within ninety (90) days of the Special Servicer’s receipt from the Master Servicer of the Master Servicer’s determination and analysis and all information reasonably requested thereby and reasonably available to the Master Servicer in order to make an informed decision, such approval shall be deemed to have been granted.  If the Special Servicer is in the process of making a determination described above in
this paragraph, then, during the period of such evaluation by the Special Servicer (or, to the extent applicable, during the period that the Special Servicer is obtaining the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative or consulting with the Trust Advisor and/or the Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable), the Master Servicer shall not be liable for any loss related to its failure to require the related Borrower to maintain terrorism insurance and shall not be in default of its obligations hereunder as a result of such failure to maintain terrorism insurance.
 
The Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and (if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved) the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) if the Master Servicer determines that any Borrower under a Serviced Mortgage Loan has failed to maintain insurance required under (or that the Master Servicer has required pursuant to a provision that entitles the lender to reasonably require insurance under) the related Mortgage Loan Documents and such failure materially and adversely affects such Mortgage Loan and/or the interest of the Trust in the related Mortgaged Property or if any Borrower under a Serviced Mortgage Loan has notified the Master Servicer in writing that such Borrower does not intend to maintain such insurance and the Master Servicer has determined that such failure materially and adversely affects
such Mortgage Loan and/or the interest of the Trust in the related Mortgaged Property.
 
(b)           Subject to Sections 3.17(b), and/or 3.24, as applicable, with respect to each Administered REO Property, the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to maintain with Qualified Insurers having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings (a) a fire and casualty extended coverage insurance policy, which does not provide for reduction due to depreciation, in an amount that is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the full replacement cost of improvements at such Administered REO Property or (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the related REO Mortgage Loan, but, in any event, in an amount sufficient to avoid the application of any co-insurance clause, (b) a comprehensive general liability insurance policy with coverage comparable to that which
would be required under prudent lending requirements and in an amount not less than $1 million per occurrence and (c) to the extent consistent with the Servicing Standard, a business interruption or rental loss insurance covering revenues or rents for a period of at least twelve (12) months, in each case if so required pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Documents; provided, that both of the following conditions and/or limitations shall apply:
 


  


-183-





  


 
(A)           the Special Servicer shall not be required to maintain or obtain the insurance coverage otherwise described above unless the Trustee has an insurable interest; and
 
(B)           the Special Servicer shall not be required to maintain or obtain the insurance coverage otherwise described above to the extent that the coverage is not available at commercially reasonable rates and consistent with the Servicing Standard.
 
All such insurance policies maintained as described above shall contain (if they insure against loss to property) a “standard” mortgagee clause, with loss payable to the Master Servicer (or the applicable sub-servicer) on behalf of the Trustee, in the case of insurance maintained in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, or shall name the Trustee as the insured, with loss payable to the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trustee, in the case of insurance maintained in respect of an Administered REO Property.  Any amounts collected by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, under any such policies (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property or amounts to be released to the related Borrower, in each case in accordance with the Servicing Standard) shall be deposited in the Collection Account
or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as appropriate in accordance with Section 3.04, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05, in the case of amounts received in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan, or in the REO Account of the Special Servicer, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.16(c), in the case of amounts received in respect of an Administered REO Property.  Any cost incurred by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for purposes hereof, including calculating monthly distributions to Certificateholders, be added to unpaid principal balance or Stated Principal Balance of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, notwithstanding that the terms of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination so permit; provided,
that this sentence shall not limit the rights of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust (and, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders) to enforce any obligations of the related Borrower under such Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.  Costs to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer of maintaining insurance policies pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall (subject to Section 3.11(h) and Section 3.19(b)) be paid by, and reimbursable to, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, as a Servicing Advance.
 
(c)           If (i) the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be obtained and maintained, a blanket policy or master force-placed policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the Serviced Mortgage Loans, Serviced Loan Combinations or Administered REO Properties, as applicable, then, to the extent such policy (A) is obtained from a Qualified Insurer having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings, and (B) provides protection equivalent to the individual policies otherwise required herein and in the Mortgage Loan Documents or (ii) the Master Servicer or Special Servicer (or its corporate parent) has long-term unsecured debt obligations that are rated not lower than “A2” by Moody’s and “A (low)” by DBRS (or, if not rated by DBRS, an equivalent rating such as those listed above by at least two other NRSRO’s (which may include S&P, Fitch and/or Moody’s)),
and the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, self-insures for its obligation to maintain the individual 
 


  


-184-





  


 
policies otherwise required, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to cause hazard insurance to be maintained on the related Mortgaged Properties or REO Properties, as applicable.  Such a blanket or master force-placed policy may contain a deductible clause (not in excess of a customary amount), in which case the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, whichever maintains such policy, shall, if there shall not have been maintained on any Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or any Administered REO Property thereunder a hazard insurance policy complying with the requirements of Section 3.07(a), and there shall have been one or more losses that would have been covered by such an individual policy, promptly deposit into the Collection
Account (or, to the extent the loss affects the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), in the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as applicable) maintained by the Master Servicer, from its own funds without any right of reimbursement from the Trust, the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket or master force-placed policy in connection with such loss or losses because of such deductible clause to the extent that any such deductible exceeds the deductible limitation that pertained to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination (or, in the absence of any such deductible limitation, the deductible limitation for an individual policy which is consistent with the Servicing Standard).  The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each prepare and present, on behalf of itself, the Trustee and Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders, claims under any such blanket or master
force-placed policy maintained by it in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policy.
 
(d)           With respect to each Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the Master Servicer has actual knowledge of any event (an “Insured Environmental Event”) giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer to such effect and the Master Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  With respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the Special Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the Special Servicer shall notify the
Master Servicer, which shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  With respect to each Administered REO Property that is subject to an Environmental Insurance Policy, if the Special Servicer has actual knowledge of any event giving rise to a claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy, the Special Servicer shall take reasonable actions as are in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the terms and conditions of such Environmental Insurance Policy to make a claim thereunder and achieve the payment of all amounts to which the Trust is entitled thereunder.  Any legal fees or other out-of-pocket costs incurred in accordance with the Servicing Standard in connection with any claim under an Environmental Insurance Policy described above (whether by the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer) shall be (subject to Section 3.11(h) and Section 3.19(b)) paid by, and reimbursable to, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, as a Servicing Advance.

(e)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each at all times during the term of this Agreement (or, in the case of the Special Servicer, at all times during the term of this Agreement during which Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and/or Administered REO Properties exist as part of the Trust Fund) keep in force with a Qualified Insurer having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings, a fidelity bond in such form and amount as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The Master Servicer or Special Servicer shall be deemed to have complied with the foregoing provision if an Affiliate thereof has such fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be.  Such fidelity bond shall provide that it may not be canceled without ten (10) days’ prior written notice to the Trustee.  So long as the
long-term unsecured debt obligations of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, or such party’s corporate parent, are rated not lower than “A2” by Moody’s and “A (low)” by DBRS, or if not rated by DBRS, then either an equivalent rating (such as that listed above for Moody’s) by at least two NRSROs (which may include S&P, Fitch and/or Moody’s) or DBRS has issued a Rating Agency Confirmation, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, may self-insure with respect to the fidelity bond coverage required as described above, in which case it shall not be required to maintain an insurance policy with respect to such coverage.
 
The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each at all times during the term of this Agreement (or, in the case of the Special Servicer, at all times during the term of this Agreement during which Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and/or Administered REO Properties exist as part of the Trust Fund) also keep in force with a Qualified Insurer having the Required Claims-Paying Ratings, a policy or policies of insurance covering loss occasioned by the errors and omissions of its officers and employees in connection with its servicing obligations hereunder, which policy or policies shall be in such form and amount as are consistent with the Servicing Standard.  The Master Servicer or Special Servicer shall be deemed to have complied with the foregoing provision if an Affiliate thereof has such policy or policies and, by the terms of such policy or policies, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Master Servicer
or the Special Servicer, as the case may be.  Any such errors and omissions policy shall provide that it may not be canceled without ten (10) days’ prior written notice to the Trustee.  So long as the long-term unsecured debt obligations of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, or such party’s corporate parent, are rated not lower than “A2” by Moody’s and “A (low)” by DBRS, or if not rated by DBRS, then either an equivalent rating (such as that listed above for Moody’s) by at least two NRSROs (which may include S&P, Fitch and/or Moody’s) or DBRS has issued a Rating Agency Confirmation, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, may self-insure with respect to the errors and omissions coverage required as described above, in which case it shall not be required to maintain an insurance policy with respect to such coverage.
 
Section 3.08     Enforcement of Alienation Clauses.
 
(a)           If the provisions of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination expressly permits the assignment of the related Mortgaged Property to, and assumption of such Mortgage Loan by, another Person upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, prohibits such an assignment or assumption except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions or fully prohibits such an assignment and assumption, and the related Borrower requests approval for such an assignment and assumption or enters into a transfer of the related

Mortgaged Property in violation of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, or if the provisions of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination expressly permits the further encumbrance of the related Mortgaged Property upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, prohibits such a further encumbrance except upon the satisfaction of specified conditions or fully prohibits such a further encumbrance, and the related Borrower requests approval for such a further encumbrance or enters into a further encumbrance in violation of the related Mortgage Loan Documents, the Master Servicer (with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, any related Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or the Special Servicer (with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall obtain the relevant information and review and make a determination to either (i) disapprove such request for approval of an assignment and
assumption or further encumbrance (in the case of a Borrower request for approval thereof) and not waive any violation of the relevant due-on-sale clause or due-on-encumbrance clause or (ii) if in the best economic interest of the Trust and, if applicable, any affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (as a collective whole), approve the request or waive the effect of the due-on-sale or due-on-encumbrance clause; provided, that all of the following conditions and/or restrictions shall apply:
 
(A)           the Master Servicer shall not enter into such a waiver or approval for any Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, any related Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, unless the Master Servicer has obtained the consent of the Special Servicer (it being understood and agreed that (1) the Master Servicer shall promptly provide the Special Servicer with (x) written notice of any Borrower request for such assignment and assumption or such encumbrance, (y) the Master Servicer’s written recommendations and analysis, and (z) all information reasonably available to the Master Servicer that the Special Servicer may reasonably request in order to withhold or grant any such consent, (2) the Special Servicer shall decide whether to withhold or grant such consent in accordance with the Servicing Standard (and subject to Section 3.24,
and/or Section 3.26 if and as applicable), and (3) if any such consent has not been expressly denied within fifteen (15) Business Days (or at least 5 Business Days after the time period provided for in the related Intercreditor Agreement) of the Special Servicer’s receipt from the Master Servicer of the Master Servicer’s written recommendations and analysis and all information reasonably requested thereby and reasonably available to the Master Servicer in order to make an informed decision, such consent shall be deemed to have been granted;
 
(B)           if approval of an assignment and assumption or waiver of a due-on-sale provision is involved and the affected Serviced Mortgage Loan is a Mortgage Loan that (together with all other Mortgage Loans, if any, that are in the same Cross-Collateralized Group as such Mortgage Loan or have the same Borrower as such Mortgage Loan or have Borrowers that are known to be affiliated with the Borrower under such Mortgage Loan) is one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans then in the Trust or has a Cut-off Date Principal Balance in excess of $20,000,000, or if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, then, subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, neither the Master Servicer (with respect to a Serviced Mortgage Loan other than a Specially 
 


  


-187-





  


 
Serviced Mortgage Loan) nor the Special Servicer (with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall enter into such approval or waiver unless and until such approval or waiver is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to Section 3.27) and in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the equivalent confirmation from each Pari Passu Companion Rating Agency with respect to the mortgage-backed securities backed by the related Pari Passu Companion Loan; and
 
(C)           if approval of a further encumbrance or waiver of a due-on-encumbrance provision is involved, then, subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, neither the Master Servicer (with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, any related Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) nor the Special Servicer (with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall enter into such approval or waiver unless and until such approval or waiver is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to Section 3.27) if the related Serviced Mortgage Loan (a) represents 2% or more of the then aggregate principal balance of all of the Mortgage Loans then in the Trust Fund, (b) is one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans then in the Trust Fund by principal balance, (c) has an aggregate loan-to-value
ratio (including existing and proposed additional debt) that is equal to or greater than 85% or (d) has an aggregate debt service coverage ratio (including the debt service on the existing and proposed additional debt) that is less than 1.2x;
 
(D)           if approval of an assignment and assumption or waiver of a due-on-sale provision is involved, then, subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, neither the Master Servicer (with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan) nor the Special Servicer (with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall enter into such approval or waiver with respect to any Mortgaged Property which secures a Cross-Collateralized Group unless (i) all of the Mortgaged Properties securing such Cross-Collateralized Group are transferred simultaneously by the respective Borrower(s) or (ii) either (x) in the case of the Master Servicer, it has obtained the consent of the Special Servicer (pursuant to the approval procedures described in clause (A) above) or (y) in the case of the Special Servicer, it has obtained the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative,
if and to the extent required under Sections 3.24 and/or Section 3.26, as applicable);
 
(E)           subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, neither the Master Servicer (with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, any related Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) nor the Special Servicer (with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall enter into such approval or waiver unless all associated costs and expenses (including the costs of any Rating Agency Confirmation) are covered without any expense to the Trust or (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination) any expense to any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (it being understood and agreed that, except as expressly provided herein, neither the 
 


  


-188-





  


 
Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be obligated to cover or assume any such costs or expenses) and if the related Borrower refuses to pay any such costs and expenses then the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be permitted to deny the related request;
 
(F)           neither the Master Servicer (with respect to a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan and, if applicable, any related Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) nor the Special Servicer (with respect to a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall, in connection with any such approval or waiver, consent or agree to any modification, waiver or amendment of any term or provision of such Serviced Mortgage Loan that would result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool; and
 
(G)           the Special Servicer shall not consent to the Master Servicer’s recommendation described in clause (A) above, or itself enter into such an approval or waiver, unless the Special Servicer has complied with Section 3.24 and/or Section 3.26, as applicable.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the Master Servicer’s approval of an assignment and assumption or further encumbrance be conditioned on the approval or absence of objection from the Special Servicer (or the Special Servicer interacting with the Subordinate Class Representative in connection with such Master Servicer approval) if (a) the transaction is permitted under the related Mortgage Loan Documents and (b) the conditions to the transaction that are set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Documents do not include the approval of the lender or the exercise of lender discretion (other than confirming the satisfaction of the other conditions to the transaction set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Documents that do not include any other approval or exercise of discretion).
 
(b)           In connection with any permitted assumption of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination or waiver of a “due-on-sale” or “due-on-encumbrance” clause thereunder, the Master Servicer (in the case of a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan) or the Special Servicer (in the case of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall prepare all documents necessary and appropriate for such purposes and shall coordinate with the related Borrower for the due execution and delivery of such documents.
 
(c)           The Master Servicer shall have the right to consent, without the approval of the Special Servicer (or the Special Servicer interacting with the Subordinate Class Representative in connection with such Master Servicer consent) to any transfers of an interest in the Borrower under a Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan, to the extent such transfer (i) is allowed under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents without the exercise of any lender approval or discretion other than confirming the satisfaction of the other conditions to the transfer set forth in the related Mortgage Loan Documents that do not include any other approval or exercise of discretion, including a consent to transfer to any subsidiary or affiliate of such Borrower or to a person acquiring less than a majority interest in such Borrower and (ii) is with respect to a Mortgage Loan as to which a Rating Agency Confirmation is

Loan Documents and applicable law, if (i) the affected Serviced Mortgage Loan is or relates to a Mortgage Loan that, together with all other Mortgage Loans, if any, that are in the same Cross-Collateralized Group as such Mortgage Loan or have the same Borrower as such Mortgage Loan or have Borrowers that are known to be affiliated with the Borrower under such Mortgage Loan, is one of the then current top ten Mortgage Loans (by Stated Principal Balance) in the Mortgage Pool, has a Cut-off Date Principal Balance in excess of $20,000,000, or has a Stated Principal Balance that equals or exceeds 5% of the then aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool, or a Serviced Loan Combination is involved and the Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement would require Rating Agency Confirmation if such Serviced Loan Combination was serviced thereunder, and (ii) the transfer is of an interest in the Borrower greater than 49% or
otherwise would result in a change in control of the Borrower (for these purposes, “control” when used with respect to any specified person means the power to direct the management and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise and the terms “controlling” and “controlled” have meanings correlative to the foregoing), then the Master Servicer shall not consent to such transfer unless and until such transfer is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to Section 3.27) (the costs of which are to be payable by the related Borrower to the extent provided for in the related Mortgage Loan Documents, which provisions shall not be waived by the Master Servicer, and, if not paid, such costs shall be paid by
and reimbursed to the Master Servicer as an Additional Trust Fund Expense).  The Master Servicer shall be entitled to collect and receive from Borrowers any customary fees in connection with such transfers of interest as Additional Master Servicing Compensation.
 
Section 3.09     Realization Upon Defaulted Serviced Mortgage Loans.
 
(a)           The Special Servicer shall, subject to Sections 3.09(b), 3.09(c), 3.09(d), Section 3.24, Section 3.26 and/or Section 3.28, as applicable, exercise reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of the real property and other collateral securing any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that comes into and continues in default and as to which no satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments, including pursuant to Section 3.20.  In
connection with the foregoing, in the event of a default under any Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Cross-Collateralized Group that is secured by real properties located in multiple states, and such states include California or another state with a statute, rule or regulation comparable to California’s “one action rule”, then the Special Servicer shall consult Independent counsel regarding the order and manner in which the Special Servicer should foreclose upon or comparably proceed against such properties.  The Special Servicer may direct the Master Servicer to advance, as contemplated by Section 3.19(b), all costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and litigation costs and expenses) to be incurred on behalf of the Trust in any such proceedings or such consultation, subject to the Master Servicer being entitled to reimbursement for any such advance as a Servicing Advance as provided in Section 3.05(a),
and further subject to the Special Servicer’s being entitled to pay out of the related Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Condemnation Proceeds any Liquidation Expenses incurred in respect of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, which Liquidation Expenses were outstanding at the time such proceeds are received.  Nothing contained in this Section 3.09 shall be construed so as to require the Special Servicer, on behalf of the Trust, to make a bid on any Mortgaged Property at a foreclosure sale or 
 


  


-190-





  


 
similar proceeding that is in excess of the fair market value of such property, as determined by the Special Servicer taking into account the factors described in Section 3.18 and the results of any appraisal obtained pursuant to the following sentence or otherwise, all such cash bids to be made in a manner consistent with the Servicing Standard.  If and when the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer deems it necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard for purposes of establishing the fair market value of any Mortgaged Property securing a defaulted Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, whether for purposes of bidding at foreclosure or otherwise, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (as the case may be) is authorized to have an Appraisal completed with respect to such property (the cost of which appraisal shall be covered
by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance).
 
The Master Servicer shall not foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert, including by taking title thereto, any real property or other collateral securing a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.09, no Mortgaged Property shall be acquired by the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) under such circumstances, in such manner or pursuant to such terms as would (i) cause such Mortgaged Property to fail to qualify as “foreclosure property” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code (unless the portion of such REO Property that is not treated as “foreclosure property” and that is held by any REMIC Pool at any given time constitutes not more than a de minimis amount of the assets of such REMIC Pool within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860D-1(b)(3)(i) and (ii)), or (ii) except as permitted by Section 3.17(a),
subject the Trust to the imposition of any federal income or prohibited transaction taxes under the Code.  Subject to the foregoing, however, a Mortgaged Property may be acquired through a single member limited liability company.  In addition, except as permitted under Section 3.17(a), the Special Servicer shall not acquire any personal property on behalf of the Trust (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) pursuant to this Section 3.09 unless either:
 
(i)            such personal property is incident to real property (within the meaning of Section 856(e)(1) of the Code) so acquired by the Special Servicer; or
 
(ii)           the Special Servicer shall have obtained an Opinion of Counsel (the cost of which shall be covered by, and reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance) to the effect that the holding of such personal property as part of the Trust Fund will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.09, the Special Servicer shall not, on behalf of the Trust (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), have a receiver of rents appointed with respect to a Mortgaged Property, or obtain title to a Mortgaged Property by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise, or take any other action with respect to any Mortgaged Property, if, as a result of any such action, the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders, could, in the reasonable judgment of the Special Servicer, exercised in accordance with the Servicing

(ii)          if the determination described in clause (c)(i) above cannot be made, the Special Servicer has previously determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard, on the same basis as described in clause (c)(i) above, and taking into account the coverage provided under the related Environmental Insurance Policy, that it would maximize the recovery to the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Loan Combination, to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (as a collective whole) on a present value basis (the relevant discounting of anticipated collections that will be distributable to Certificateholders and, in the case of a Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Loan Combination, to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), to be performed at the related Net Mortgage Rate (or (x) in the case of
an ARD Mortgage Loan after its Anticipated Repayment Date, at the related Net Mortgage Rate immediately prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date, or (y) in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, at the weighted average of the Net Mortgage Rates for the related notes)), to be performed at the related Net Mortgage Rate) to acquire title to or possession of the Mortgaged Property and to take such remedial, corrective and/or other further actions as are necessary to bring the Mortgaged Property into compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to appropriately address any of the circumstances and conditions referred to in clause (c)(i) above.
 
Any such determination by the Special Servicer contemplated by clause (i) or clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph shall be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate to such effect delivered to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (and, in the case of a Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Loan Combination, to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), specifying all of the bases for such determination, such Officer’s Certificate to be accompanied by all related environmental reports.
 
The cost of such Phase I Environmental Assessment and any such additional environmental testing, as well as the cost of any remedial, corrective or other further action contemplated by clause (i) and/or clause (ii) of the preceding paragraph, shall be paid out of the Collection Account (subject to, if it relates to one or more Mortgage Loans in a Serviced Loan

(d)           If neither of the conditions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of Section 3.09(c) has been satisfied with respect to any Mortgaged Property securing a defaulted Serviced Mortgage Loan (or, if applicable, a Serviced Loan Combination), the Special Servicer shall take such action as is in accordance with the Servicing Standard (other than proceeding against the Mortgaged Property) and, at such time as it deems appropriate, may, on behalf of the Trust and, if applicable, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), release all or a portion of such Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage; provided that both (i) if such Serviced Mortgage Loan has a then outstanding principal balance greater than $1 million, then prior to the release of
all or a portion of the related Mortgaged Property from the lien of the related Mortgage, the Special Servicer shall have notified the Rating Agencies (subject to Section 3.27), the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Master Servicer, in writing of its intention to so release all or a portion of such Mortgaged Property and the basis for the determination that such intention, in the Special Servicer’s good faith judgment, was consistent with the Servicing Standard and (ii) if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the holders of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or their representatives shall have the rights, if any, in respect thereof that are enumerated in the related Intercreditor Agreement.

related Mortgage on such Mortgaged Property and the related Mortgage Loan’s (or in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, each of the related Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) becoming a Corrected Mortgage Loan.
 
(f)           The Special Servicer shall have the right to determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the advisability of seeking to obtain a deficiency judgment if the state in which the related Mortgaged Property is located and the terms of the subject Mortgage Loan permit such an action and shall, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, seek such deficiency judgment if it deems advisable.  The Master Servicer, at the direction of the Special Servicer, shall make a Servicing Advance for the costs incurred in pursuing any such deficiency action, provided that the Master Servicer shall not be obligated in connection therewith to advance any funds, which if so advanced would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance.
 
(g)           Annually in each January, the Master Servicer shall, with the reasonable cooperation of the Special Servicer, prepare and file with the IRS on a timely basis the

(xi)          a portion of Net Default Charges as set forth in Section 3.25.
 
To the extent that any of the amounts described in clauses (i) through (ix) in the preceding paragraph are collected by the Special Servicer, the Special Servicer shall promptly pay such amounts to the Master Servicer.
 
(c)           As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive monthly the Special Servicing Fee with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, and each successor REO Mortgage Loan thereto that relates to an Administered REO Property.  As to each such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan, for any particular calendar month or applicable portion thereof, the Special Servicing Fee shall accrue at the Special Servicing Fee Rate on the Stated Principal Balance of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or related REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, and shall be calculated on the same Interest Accrual Basis as is applicable for such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, and for the same number of days respecting which any related interest payment due on such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or deemed to
be due on such REO Mortgage Loan is computed under the terms of the related Mortgage Note (as such terms may be changed or modified at any time following the Closing Date) and applicable law.  To the extent attributable to a Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicing Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan thereto shall cease to accrue as of the date a Liquidation Event occurs in respect of such Mortgage Loan or, in the case of such a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, as of the date that such Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  To the extent attributable to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Special Servicing Fee with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan thereto shall cease to accrue as of the date a Liquidation Event occurs in respect of the related Mortgage Loan or REO Property included in the same Serviced Loan Combination or, in the case of such a Specially
Serviced Mortgage Loan, as of the date the related Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  Earned but unpaid Special Servicing Fees with respect to Mortgage Loans that are Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Mortgage Loans shall be payable (pursuant to Section 3.05(a)) monthly first out of related Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Condemnation Proceeds, if any, and then out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and any REO Properties on deposit in the Collection Account and earned but unpaid Special Servicing Fees with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto shall be payable in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and first, out of the proceeds of such Serviced Loan Combination on deposit in the Collection Account and/or the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (as applicable)
and then out of general collections in the Collection Account (following which, the Special Servicer shall use efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to exercise promptly the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement from the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or if the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is held by an Other Securitization, from such Other Securitization)

of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan’s allocable share of such Special Servicing Fees to the extent so paid from general collections in the Collection Account).
 
As further compensation for its activities hereunder, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive the Workout Fee with respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that is a Corrected Mortgage Loan, unless the basis on which the related Serviced Mortgage Loan became a Corrected Mortgage Loan was the remediation of a circumstance or condition relating to the related Responsible Repurchase Party’s obligation to repurchase the related Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, as applicable, in which case, if such Mortgage Loan is repurchased within the Initial Resolution Period (and, if applicable any Resolution Extension Period as is permitted under Section 2.03) no Workout Fee will be payable from or based upon the receipt of, any Purchase Price paid by the related
Responsible Repurchase Party in satisfaction of such repurchase obligation.  As to each such Corrected Mortgage Loan, the Workout Fee shall be payable out of, and shall be calculated by application of the Workout Fee Rate to, each payment of interest (other than Default Interest and Post-ARD Additional Interest) and principal received from the related Borrower on such Corrected Mortgage Loan for so long as it remains a Corrected Mortgage Loan, except that any Workout Fees earned with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto and attributable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan shall be payable in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and solely out of the proceeds of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan; provided, that any Workout Fees earned with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto will be payable
out of any proceeds on or with respect to such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and/or the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder’s share of proceeds on such related REO Property prior to any proceeds on or with respect to the Mortgage Loan and/or the Trust Fund’s share of proceeds on such related REO Property as otherwise described above.  In addition, the determination and payment of the Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan for which the amount of related Offsetting Modification Fees is greater than zero shall be adjusted in the following manner:  (i) the Workout Fee Rate shall be multiplied by the aggregate amount of all the scheduled payments of principal and interest scheduled to become due under the terms of such Corrected Mortgage Loan during the period from the date when such Mortgage Loan (or Serviced Loan Combination) becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan to and including the maturity date of such Corrected
Mortgage Loan, without discounting for present value (the resulting product, the “Workout Fee Projected Amount”); and (ii) either (a) if the amount of the Offsetting Modification Fees for such Corrected Mortgage Loan is greater than or equal to the Workout Fee Projected Amount for such Corrected Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall not be entitled to any payments in respect of the Workout Fee with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan, or (b) if the amount of Offsetting Modification Fees for such Corrected Mortgage Loan is less than the Workout Fee Projected Amount, the Special Servicer shall be entitled to payments of the Workout Fee with respect to such Corrected Mortgage Loan, on the terms and conditions otherwise set forth in this Agreement without regard to this sentence, until the cumulative amount of such payments is equal to the excess of the Workout Fee Projected Amount over the Offsetting Modification Fees, after which date the
Special Servicer shall not be entitled to any further payments in respect of the Workout Fee for such Corrected Mortgage Loan.  The Workout Fee with respect to any Corrected Mortgage Loan shall cease to be payable if such Corrected Mortgage Loan again becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or if the related
 


  


-201-





  


 
Mortgaged Property becomes an REO Property; provided that a new Workout Fee would become payable if and when such Serviced Mortgage Loan again became a Corrected Mortgage Loan after having again become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  If the Special Servicer is terminated or resigns, the Special Servicer shall retain the right (and the applicable successor Special Servicer shall not have the right) to receive any and all Workout Fees payable in respect of (i) any Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan serviced by the Special Servicer that became Corrected Mortgage Loans during the period that it acted as Special Servicer and that were still Corrected Mortgage Loans at the time of such termination or resignation and (ii) unless the Special Servicer was terminated for cause (in which case only clause (i) above shall apply), any Serviced Mortgage Loans
or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan that constitute Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans for which the Special Servicer has resolved the circumstances and/or conditions causing any such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan to be a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan such that the Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan would be deemed a Corrected Mortgage Loan but for the Borrower having not yet made, as of the date of such termination or resignation, three timely Monthly Payments required by the terms of the workout; provided, that in either case no other event has occurred as of the time of the Special Servicer’s termination or resignation that would otherwise cause such Mortgage Loan to again become a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.
 
As further compensation for its activities hereunder, the Special Servicer shall also be entitled to receive a Liquidation Fee with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) as to which any full, partial or discounted payoff is received from the related Borrower and with respect to each Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property (in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, including in each case both the interest therein represented by the related Mortgage Loan and the interest therein represented by the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) as to which the Special Servicer receives any Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds and (without duplication)
each Serviced Mortgage Loan as to which the Special Servicer otherwise receives any Liquidation Proceeds (in each case, other than in connection with (A) the purchase or other acquisition of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan by any Subordinate Class Certificateholder(s), the Sole Certificateholder(s), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 9.01, (B) (i) the repurchase or replacement of any Serviced Mortgage Loan by a Responsible Repurchase Party pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement as a result of a Material Breach or Material Document Defect, if the repurchase or replacement occurs prior to the end of the period, as the same may be extended, in which such Responsible Repurchase Party must cure, repurchase or substitute for such Serviced Mortgage Loan or (ii) the repurchase or replacement of any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan by a responsible
repurchase party pursuant to the related mortgage loan purchase agreement as a result of a material breach or material document defect thereunder, if the repurchase or replacement occurs prior to the end of the period, as the same may be extended, in which such responsible repurchase party must cure, repurchase or substitute for such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, (C) in the case of a Mortgage Loan included in a Serviced Loan Combination or any related Administered REO Property, the purchase or other acquisition of any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property by any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) pursuant to or as contemplated by Section 3.26 (provided

that a Liquidation Fee shall be payable in connection with such a purchase by a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder relating to a Serviced Loan Combination pursuant to the defaulted loan purchase option granted to it under the related Intercreditor Agreement if the purchase occurs more than ninety (90) days after the later of (x) the date when the related Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (y) the date when such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder receives the initial written notice from the Special Servicer that such transfer to special servicing has occurred) or (D) the purchase of any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property by any other creditor of the related Borrower or any of its Affiliates or other equity holders pursuant to a right under the related Mortgage Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the purchase of any such Specially Serviced Mortgage
Loan or Administered REO Property by a mezzanine lender of the related Borrower or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the related mezzanine intercreditor or other similar agreement) (provided that such right is exercised within ninety (90) days after such creditor’s purchase option first becomes exercisable and in the manner required under such Mortgage Loan Documents or, with respect to any purchase by a mezzanine lender pursuant to the related mezzanine intercreditor agreement, if the purchase occurs within ninety (90) days after the later of (x) the date when the related Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and (y) the date when such mezzanine lender receives the initial written notice from the Special Servicer that such transfer to special servicing has occurred)).  As to each such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property for which the Special Servicer is entitled to a Liquidation Fee as set
forth above, such Liquidation Fee shall be payable out of, and shall be calculated by application of the Liquidation Fee Rate to, any such full, partial or discounted payoff, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Liquidation Proceeds received or collected in respect thereof (other than any portion of such payment or proceeds that represents Default Charges or Post-ARD Additional Interest) provided, that any Liquidation Fees earned with respect to a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in a Serviced Loan Combination shall be payable out of any collections on or with respect to such related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and/or the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder’s share of collections on any related Administered REO Property prior to payment out of any collections otherwise described above).  The Liquidation Fee with respect to any such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan shall not be payable if such Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan becomes a Corrected Mortgage Loan.  In addition, if a Liquidation Fee otherwise becomes payable with respect a Mortgage Loan, then such Liquidation Fee payable to the Special Servicer with respect to such Mortgage Loan in the aggregate shall be reduced by the amount of any Offsetting Modification Fees.
 
The Special Servicer’s right to receive any Special Servicing Fee, Workout Fee and/or Liquidation Fee to which it is entitled may not be transferred in whole or in part except in connection with the transfer of all of the Special Servicer’s responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement and except as otherwise expressly provided herein, including as provided in the next sentence.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Special Servicer may enter into one or more arrangements with the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and/or the Subordinate Class Representative, or any other Person(s) that may be entitled to remove or replace the Special Servicer, to provide for the payment by the Special Servicer to such party or parties of certain of the Special Servicer’s compensation hereunder, whether in consideration of the Special Servicer’s appointment or continuation of appointment as Special Servicer in connection
with this Agreement or the related Intercreditor Agreement, limitations on such 
 


  


-203-





  


 
parties’ right to terminate or replace the Special Servicer in connection with this Agreement or the related Intercreditor Agreement or otherwise.  If the Special Servicer exercises the authority set forth in the preceding sentence, any and all obligations pursuant to any such agreement shall constitute obligations solely of the Special Servicer and not of any other party hereto.  If the Special Servicer enters into such an agreement and one or more other Person(s) thereafter becomes the applicable Majority Subordinate Certificateholders, the Subordinate Class Representative, or becomes entitled to remove or replace the Special Servicer, as applicable, such agreement shall not be binding on such other Person(s), nor may it limit the rights that otherwise inure to the benefit of such other Person(s) as the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and/or the Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable, or as a party otherwise entitled to
remove or replace the Special Servicer, in the absence of such other Persons(s)’ express written consent, which may be granted or withheld in their sole discretion.
 
(d)           The Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive the following items as additional special servicing compensation (the following items, collectively, the “Additional Special Servicing Compensation”):
 
(i)            100% of Modification Fees actually collected during the related Collection Period with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans or REO Mortgage Loans;
 
(ii)           50% of Modification Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Performing Serviced Mortgage Loans and the Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in connection with a consent, approval or other action that the Master Servicer is not permitted to take in the absence of the consent or approval (or deemed consent or approval) of the Special Servicer under the other provisions of this Agreement;
 
(iii)          100% of Assumption Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans, and 50% of Assumption Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Performing Serviced Mortgage Loans and the Performing Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan in connection with a consent, approval or other action that the Master Servicer is not permitted to take in the absence of the consent or approval (or deemed consent or approval) of the Special Servicer under the other provisions of this Agreement;
 
(iv)          100% of Assumption Application Fees collected during the related Collection Period with respect to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;

-204-





  


 
(vi)         100% of charges for beneficiary statements or demands actually paid by the Borrowers under the Mortgage Loans that are Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;
 
(vii)         (a) 50% of other loan processing fees actually paid by the Borrowers under the Serviced Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loans that are not Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans to the extent that the consent of the Special Servicer is required in connection with the associated action, and (b) 100% of other loan processing fees actually paid by the Borrowers under Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;
 
(viii)        interest or other income earned on deposits in any REO Account and the Loss of Value Reserve Account maintained by the Special Servicer, in accordance with Section 3.06(b) (but only to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, with respect to such REO Account for each Collection Period); and
 
(ix)          a portion of Net Default Charges as set forth in Section 3.25.
 
To the extent that any of the amounts described in clauses (i) through (vii) of the preceding paragraph are collected by the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer shall promptly pay such amounts to the Special Servicer and shall not be required to deposit such amounts in the Collection Account or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.04.
 
(e)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each be required (subject to Section 3.11(h) below) to pay out of its own funds all expenses incurred by it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder (including payment of any amounts due and owing to any of Sub-Servicers retained by it (including any termination fees) and the premiums for any blanket policy or the standby fee or similar premium, if any, for any master force placed policy obtained by it insuring against hazard losses pursuant to Section 3.07(c)), if and to the extent such expenses are not payable directly out of the Collection Account, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, any Servicing Account, Reserve Account or REO Account, and neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement
for any such expense incurred by it except as expressly provided in this Agreement.  If the Master Servicer is required to make any Servicing Advance hereunder at the discretion of the Special Servicer in accordance with Section 3.19 or otherwise, the Special Servicer shall promptly provide the Master Servicer with such documentation regarding the subject Servicing Advance as the Master Servicer may reasonably request.
 
(f)            If the Master Servicer or, as contemplated by Section 3.19, the Special Servicer is required under this Agreement to make a Servicing Advance, but fails to do so within ten (10) days after such Advance is required to be made, the Trustee shall, if it has actual knowledge of such failure on the part of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, give notice of such failure to the defaulting party.  If such Advance is not made by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, within one Business Day after receipt of such a notice, then (subject to Section 3.11(h) below) the Trustee shall make such Advance.
 


  


-205-





  


 
(g)           The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trustee shall each be entitled to receive interest at the Reimbursement Rate in effect from time to time, accrued on the amount of each Servicing Advance made thereby (with its own funds), for so long as such Servicing Advance is outstanding (it being acknowledged that Advance Interest shall not accrue on Unliquidated Advances related to prior Servicing Advances).  Such interest with respect to any Servicing Advances shall be payable:  (i) first, in accordance with Sections 3.05 and 3.25, out of any Default Charges subsequently collected on or in respect of the particular Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Property as to which such Servicing Advance relates; and (ii) then,
after such Servicing Advance is reimbursed, but only if and to the extent that such Default Charges are insufficient to cover such Advance Interest, out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties on deposit in the Collection Account.  The Master Servicer shall (subject to the operation of Section 3.05(a)(II)) reimburse itself, the Special Servicer or the Trustee, as appropriate, for any Servicing Advance made by any such Person with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property as soon as practicable after funds available for such purpose are deposited in the Collection Account or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, as applicable.
 
(h)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, none of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall be required to make any Servicing Advance that would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance.  The determination by any Person with an obligation hereunder to make Servicing Advances that it has made a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Servicing Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, shall be made by such Person in its reasonable, good faith judgment.  In making such recoverability determination, such Person will be entitled to consider (among other things) the obligations of the Borrower under the terms of the related Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination as it may have been modified, to consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their “as is” or then current conditions
and occupancies, as modified by such party’s assumptions regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, to estimate and consider (among other things) future expenses and to estimate and consider (among other things) the timing of recoveries.  In addition, any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time and may obtain any analysis, Appraisals or market value estimates or other information in the possession of the Special Servicer for such purposes.  Any determination by any Person with an obligation hereunder to make Servicing Advances that it has made a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Servicing Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered promptly to the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee (unless it is the Person making such determination), the Special
Servicer, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), setting forth the basis for such determination, accompanied by a copy of any Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property performed within the 12 months preceding such determination by a Qualified Appraiser, and, if such reports were used by the Master Servicer or the Trustee to determine that any Servicing Advance is or would be nonrecoverable, further accompanied by any other information, including engineers’ reports, environmental surveys or similar reports, that the Person making such determination may have obtained.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, absent bad faith, any such determination as to the recoverability of any Servicing Advance shall 
 


  


-206-





  

 
be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders and, in all cases, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any determination of nonrecoverability that may have been made by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer or, if appropriate, any party under the related Non-Trust Servicing Agreement (in the case of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan), and the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall each be entitled to conclusively rely on any determination of nonrecoverability that may have been made by the other such party or, if appropriate, any party under the related Non-Trust Servicing Agreement (in the case of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) with respect to a particular Servicing Advance for any Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Property.  The Special Servicer shall promptly furnish any party required to make Servicing Advances hereunder with any information in its
possession regarding the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties as such party required to make Servicing Advances may reasonably request.  A copy of any such Officer’s Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Master Servicer shall also be delivered promptly to the Special Servicer, a copy of any such Officer’s Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Special Servicer shall also be promptly delivered to the Master Servicer for the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or Administered REO Property, and a copy of any such Officer’s Certificates (and accompanying information) of the Trustee shall also be promptly delivered to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s).  The Master Servicer and
the Special Servicer shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior Servicing Advances as outstanding Advances for purposes of recoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advance were a Servicing Advance.

 
The Special Servicer shall also be entitled to make (but shall not be obligated to make or not make) a determination (subject to the same standards and procedures that apply in connection with a determination by the Master Servicer) to the effect that a prior Servicing Advance (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) previously made hereunder by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) constitutes a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Servicing Advance by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee), if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, in which case such Servicing Advance shall constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance for all purposes of this Agreement.  The preceding statement shall not be construed to limit the provision set forth in Section 3.19(b) to
the effect that any request by the Special Servicer that the Master Servicer make a Servicing Advance shall be deemed to be a determination by the Special Servicer that such Servicing Advance is not a Nonrecoverable Advance.
 
(i)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Master Servicer may (and, at the direction of the Special Servicer if a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination that is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or an Administered REO Property is involved, shall) pay directly out of the Collection Account any servicing expense that, if paid by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance for the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan, Serviced Loan Combination or REO Property; provided that (A) it shall be a condition to such payment that the Master Servicer (or the Special Servicer, if a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or an
 


  


-207-





  

 
Administered REO Property is involved) has determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard that making such payment is in the best interests of the Certificateholders and, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders (as a collective whole), as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered promptly to the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), setting forth the basis for such determination and accompanied by any information that such Person may have obtained that supports such determination; (B) if such servicing expense relates to the Serviced Loan Combination, the payment of such expense shall be subject to the proviso at the end of the first paragraph of subsection (I) of Section 3.05(a);
and (C) such servicing expense shall be deemed to constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance for purposes of subsection (II)(iv) of Section 3.05(a) and the definition of “Principal Distribution Amount” and the terms and conditions set forth in such subsection that are applicable to Nonrecoverable Advances shall apply to such servicing expense.  A copy of any such Officer’s Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Master Servicer shall also be delivered promptly to the Subordinate Class Representative (and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)) and the Special Servicer, and a copy of any such Officer’s Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Special Servicer shall also be promptly delivered to the Master Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative (and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)).

 
(j)           With respect to each Collection Period, the Special Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Certificate Administrator, without charge and within two Business Days following the related Determination Date, a report in EDGAR Compatible Format (or such other format as mutually agreeable between the Certificate Administrator and the Special Servicer) that discloses and contains an itemized listing of any Disclosable Special Servicer Fees received by the Special Servicer or any of its Affiliates, if any, during the related Collection Period.
 
(k)          The Special Servicer and its Affiliates shall be prohibited from receiving or retaining any compensation or any other remuneration (including, without limitation, in the form of commissions, brokerage fees, rebates, or as a result of any other fee-sharing arrangement) from any Person (including, without limitation, the Trust, any Borrower, any property manager, any guarantor or indemnitor in respect of a Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination and any purchaser of any Mortgage Loan or REO Property) in connection with the disposition, workout or foreclosure of any Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, the management or disposition of any REO Property, or the performance of any other special servicing duties under this Agreement, other than as expressly provided in this Section 3.11; provided that such prohibition
shall not apply to Permitted Special Servicer/Affiliate Fees.
 
(l)           If either the Republic Plaza Mortgage Loan or the Concord Mills Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced  Loan prior to the securitization of the related Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Special Servicer shall service and administer the related Loan Combination and any related REO Property in the same manner as any other Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property and shall be entitled to all rights and compensation earned with  
 


  


-208-





  

 
respect to such Serviced Loan Combination as Special Servicer of such Serviced Loan Combination.  With respect to each of the Republic Plaza Mortgage Loan and the Concord Mills Mortgage Loan, prior to the securitization of the related Pari Passu Companion Loan, no other special servicer will be entitled to any such compensation or have such rights and obligations.  If any such Loan Combination is still a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan on the date of the securitization of its related Pari Passu Companion Loan, the applicable Other Special Servicer and the Special Servicer shall be entitled to compensation with respect to such Loan Combination as if the Special Servicer were being terminated as Special Servicer and the Other Special Servicer were replacing it as the successor special servicer.

(a)          The Special Servicer shall perform or cause to be performed a physical inspection of a Mortgaged Property securing a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan as soon as practicable (but in any event not later than sixty (60) days) after the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan (and the Special Servicer shall continue to perform or cause to be performed a physical inspection of the subject Mortgaged Property at least once per calendar year thereafter for so long as the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan remains a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or if such Mortgaged Property becomes an REO Property); provided that the Special Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the reasonable and direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in connection with each such inspection as Servicing Advances or otherwise as contemplated by Section 3.05(a).  The
Master Servicer shall, at its own expense, inspect or cause to be inspected each Mortgaged Property (other than the Mortgaged Property securing a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) every calendar year beginning in 2014, or every second calendar year beginning in 2015 if the unpaid principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan (or the portion thereof allocated to such Mortgaged Property) is less than $2,000,000; provided that with respect to any Serviced Mortgage Loan (other than a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan) that has an aggregate unpaid principal balance of less than $2,000,000 and has been placed on the CREFC Servicer Watch List, the Master Servicer shall, at the request and expense of the Subordinate Class Representative, inspect or cause to be inspected the related Mortgaged Property every calendar year not earlier than 2014 so long as such Mortgage Loan continues to be on the CREFC Servicer Watch List; and provided,
further, that the Master Servicer will not be obligated to inspect any particular Mortgaged Property during any one-year or two-year, as applicable, period contemplated above in this sentence, if the Special Servicer has already done so during that period pursuant to the preceding sentence or on any date when the related Mortgage Loan is a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan.  Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall prepare and, promptly following preparation, if there has been a material adverse change in the condition of the subject Mortgaged Property or REO Property, as applicable, deliver to the Trustee, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Master Servicer (if such report is prepared by the Special Servicer) and the Special Servicer (if such report is prepared by the Master Servicer) (and, if a Mortgaged Property or REO Property relates to the Serviced Loan Combination, the Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) if and to the extent required under the applicable Intercreditor Agreement), and the Rating Agencies (subject to Section 3.27) a written report of each such inspection performed by it or on its behalf that sets forth in detail the condition of the subject Mortgaged Property and that specifies the occurrence or existence of:  (i) any vacancy in the Mortgaged Property that is, in the reasonable

judgment of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer (or its respective designee), as the case may be, material and is evident from such inspection, (ii) any abandonment of the Mortgaged Property of which it is aware, (iii) any change in the condition or value of the Mortgaged Property that is, in the reasonable judgment of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer (or its respective designee), as the case may be, material and is evident from such inspection, (iv) any material waste on or deferred maintenance in respect of the Mortgaged Property that is evident from such inspection or (v) any material capital improvements made that are evident from such inspection.  Such report may be in the form of the standard property inspection report (or such other form for the presentation of such information) as may from time to time be recommended by the CREFC for commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions generally.  Each of
the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall deliver to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee (and to the Master Servicer, if done by the Special Servicer) and, upon request, to or at the direction of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period) and, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, a copy (or image in suitable electronic media) of each such written report prepared by it, in each case within thirty (30) days following the request (or, if later or if request is not required, within thirty (30) days following the later of completion of the related inspection if the inspection is performed by the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as appropriate,
or receipt of the related inspection report if the inspection is performed by a third party).

 
(b)           Commencing with respect to the calendar year ending December 31, 2013 (as to annual information) and the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2013 (as to quarterly information), the Special Servicer, in the case of any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, and the Master Servicer, in the case of each Performing Serviced Mortgage Loan, shall make reasonable efforts to collect promptly from each related Borrower quarterly and annual operating statements, budgets and rent rolls of the related Mortgaged Property, and quarterly and annual financial statements of such Borrower, whether or not delivery of such items is required pursuant to the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  The Master Servicer shall deliver images in suitable electronic media of all of the foregoing items so collected or obtained
by it to the Persons and in the time and manner set forth in Section 4.02(d).  In addition, the Special Servicer shall cause quarterly and annual operating statements, budgets and rent rolls to be regularly prepared in respect of each Administered REO Property and shall collect all such items promptly following their preparation.  The Special Servicer shall deliver images in suitable electronic media of all of the foregoing items so collected or obtained by it to the Master Servicer, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period and any Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period and any Senior Consultation Period) and, if the Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) if and to

Section 3.15     Access to Information.
 
(a)           Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall afford to the OTS, the FDIC, any other banking or insurance regulatory authority that may exercise authority over any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor (except that the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to such access only from the Special Servicer during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period and only with respect to Mortgage Loan information that is reasonably necessary in order for the Trust Advisor to perform any consultation right or duty it may then currently have with respect to such Mortgage Loan under the other provisions of this Agreement), the Depositor, each Underwriter, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, access to any records regarding the Mortgage Loans (or, in the case of a Serviced Pari Passu
Companion Loan Holder, only the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) and the servicing thereof within its control, except to the extent it is prohibited from doing so by applicable law, the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents or contract entered into prior to the Closing Date or to the extent such information is subject to a privilege under applicable law to be asserted on behalf of the Certificateholders.  At the election of the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer, such access may be so afforded to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, by the delivery of copies of information as requested by such Person and the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be permitted to

(b)           In connection with providing access to information pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section 3.15, Section 4.02(a), Section 8.12(d) or, only with respect to clause (i) below, Section 8.12(g), each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer may (i) affix a reasonable disclaimer to any information provided by it for which it is not the original source (without suggesting liability on the part of any other party hereto); (ii) affix to any information provided by it a reasonable statement regarding securities law restrictions on such information and/or condition access to information on the execution of a reasonable confidentiality agreement; (iii) withhold access to
confidential information or any intellectual property; and (iv) withhold access to items of information contained in the Servicing File for any Serviced Mortgage Loan if the disclosure of such items is prohibited by applicable law or the provisions of any related Mortgage Loan Documents or would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.  In connection with providing access to information pursuant to this Section 3.15, the Master Servicer shall require the execution (which may be in electronic form) of a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit K-3 hereto.

(c)           Upon the request of the Subordinate Class Representative made not more frequently than once a month during the normal business hours of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall, without charge, make a knowledgeable Servicing Officer available either by telephone (with Servicing Officers of each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer participating simultaneously if the Subordinate Class Representative so requests) or, at the option of the Subordinate Class Representative if it provides reasonable advance notice, at the office of such Servicing Officer, to verbally answer questions from the Subordinate Class Representative regarding the performance and servicing of the Serviced Mortgage Loans and/or Administered REO Properties for which the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, is responsible.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the failure of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer to disclose any information otherwise required to be disclosed by it pursuant to this Agreement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement to the extent that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, determines, in its reasonable and good faith judgment consistent with the Servicing Standard, that such disclosure would violate applicable law or any provision of a Mortgage Loan Document prohibiting disclosure of information with respect to the Mortgage Loans or the Mortgaged Properties, constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege on behalf of the Trust or the Trust Fund or otherwise materially harm the Trust or the Trust Fund.
 
(e)           Neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be liable for providing, disseminating or withholding information in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In addition to their other rights hereunder, each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer (and their respective employees, attorneys, officers, directors and agents) shall, in each case, be indemnified by the Trust Fund for any claims, losses or expenses arising from any such provision, dissemination or withholding.
 
Section 3.16     Title to Administered REO Property; REO Account.
 
(a)           If title to any Administered REO Property is acquired, the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued to the Trustee or its nominee, on behalf of the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, also the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), or, subject to Section 3.09(b), to a single member limited liability company of which the Trust is the sole member, which limited liability company is formed or caused to be formed by the Special Servicer at the expense of the Trust (or, in the case of an Administered REO Property related to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Trust and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) for the purpose of taking title to one or more Administered REO Properties pursuant to this Agreement.  Any such limited liability company formed by the
Special Servicer shall be a manager-managed limited liability company, with the Special Servicer to serve as the initial manager to manage the property of the limited liability company, including any applicable Administered REO Property, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as if such property was held directly in the name of the Trust or Trustee under this Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall sell any Administered REO Property in accordance with Section 3.18 by the end of the third calendar year following the year in which the Trust acquires ownership of such Administered REO Property for purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, unless the Special Servicer either (i) applies, more than sixty 
 


  


-212-





  

 
(60) days prior to the expiration of such liquidation period, and is granted (or, pursuant to IRS regulations, deemed to have been granted) an extension of time (an “REO Extension”) by the IRS to sell such Administered REO Property or (ii) obtains for the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the Trustee, to the effect that the holding by the Trust of such Administered REO Property subsequent to the end of the third calendar year following the year in which such acquisition occurred will not result in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool.  Regardless of whether the Special Servicer applies for or is granted the REO Extension contemplated by clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence or obtains the Opinion of Counsel referred to in clause (ii) of such sentence,
the Special Servicer shall act in accordance with the Servicing Standard to liquidate the subject Administered REO Property on a timely basis.  If the Special Servicer is granted such REO Extension or obtains such Opinion of Counsel with respect to any Administered REO Property, the Special Servicer shall (i) promptly forward a copy of such REO Extension or Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee, and (ii) sell the subject Administered REO Property within such extended period as is permitted by such REO Extension or contemplated by such Opinion of Counsel, as the case may be.  Any expense incurred by the Special Servicer in connection with its applying for and being granted the REO Extension contemplated by clause (i) of the third preceding sentence or its obtaining the Opinion of Counsel contemplated by clause (ii) of the third preceding sentence, and for the creation of and the operating of a limited liability company, shall
be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.

 
(b)           The Special Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received by it in connection with any Administered REO Property separate and apart from its own funds and general assets.  If any REO Acquisition occurs in respect of any Mortgaged Property securing a Serviced Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination, then the Special Servicer shall establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, an “REO Account”), to be held on behalf of the Trustee in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Administered REO Property related to a Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of both the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as a collective whole, for the retention of revenues and other proceeds derived from such Administered REO Property.  Each account that constitutes an REO Account shall
be an Eligible Account.  The Special Servicer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in its REO Account, within one Business Day following receipt, all REO Revenues, Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds received in respect of an Administered REO Property.  Funds in an REO Account may be invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with Section 3.06.  The Special Servicer is authorized to pay out of related Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and/or Condemnation Proceeds, if any, any Liquidation Expenses incurred in respect of an Administered REO Property and outstanding at the time such proceeds are received, as well as any other items that otherwise may be paid by the Master Servicer out of such Liquidation Proceeds as contemplated by Section 3.05(a).  The Special Servicer shall be entitled to make withdrawals from
its REO Account to pay itself, as Additional Special Servicing Compensation, interest and investment income earned in respect of amounts held in such REO Account as provided in Section 3.06(b) (but only to the extent of the Net Investment Earnings, if any, with respect to such REO Account for any Collection Period).  The Special Servicer shall give notice to the other parties hereto of the location of its REO Account when first established and of the new location of such REO Account prior to any change thereof.
 


  


-213-





  


 
(c)           The Special Servicer shall withdraw from its REO Account funds necessary for the proper operation, management, leasing, maintenance and disposition of any Administered REO Property, but only to the extent of amounts on deposit in such REO Account relating to such Administered REO Property.  Monthly within one Business Day following the end of each Collection Period, the Special Servicer shall withdraw from its REO Account and deposit into the Collection Account, or deliver to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account, the aggregate of all amounts received in respect of each Administered REO Property during such Collection Period that are then on deposit in such REO Account, net of any withdrawals made out of such amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided that (A) in the case of each Administered REO Property, the Special Servicer may retain in
its REO Account such portion of such proceeds and collections as may be necessary to maintain a reserve of sufficient funds for the proper operation, management, leasing, maintenance and disposition of such Administered REO Property (including the creation of a reasonable reserve for repairs, replacements, necessary capital improvements and other related expenses) and (B) if such Administered REO Property relates to a Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer shall make, from such amounts so deposited or remitted as described above, any deposits into any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account contemplated by Section 3.04(h) or Section 3.04(i), as applicable.  For the avoidance of doubt, such amounts withdrawn from an REO Account and deposited into the Collection Account following the end of each Collection Period pursuant to the preceding sentence shall,
upon such deposit, be construed to have been received by the Master Servicer during such Collection Period.
 
(d)           The Special Servicer shall keep and maintain separate records, on a property-by-property basis, for the purpose of accounting for all deposits to, and withdrawals from, its REO Account pursuant to Section 3.16(b) or 3.16(c).
 
(e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 3.16 shall not apply to any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.
 
Section 3.17     Management of Administered REO Property.
 
(a)           Prior to the acquisition of title to any Mortgaged Property securing a defaulted Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall review the operation of such Mortgaged Property and determine the nature of the income that would be derived from such property if it were acquired by the Trust.  If the Special Servicer determines from such review that:
 
(i)           None of the income from Directly Operating such Mortgaged Property would be subject to tax as “net income from foreclosure property” within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions (such tax referred to herein as an “REO Tax”), then such Mortgaged Property may be Directly Operated by the Special Servicer as Administered REO Property, other than holding such Administered REO Property for sale or lease or performing construction work thereon;
 
(ii)          Directly Operating such Mortgaged Property as an Administered REO Property could result in income from such property that would be subject to an REO Tax, but that a lease of such property to another party to operate such property, or the 
 


  


-214-





  

 
performance of some services by an Independent Contractor with respect to such property, or another method of operating such property would not result in income subject to an REO Tax, then the Special Servicer may (provided that in the judgment of the Special Servicer, exercised in accordance with the Servicing Standard, it is commercially reasonable) so lease or otherwise operate such Administered REO Property; or

 
(iii)         It is reasonable to believe that Directly Operating such property as Administered REO Property could result in income subject to an REO Tax and either (i) that the income or earnings with respect to such REO Property will offset any REO Tax relating to such income or earnings and will maximize the net recovery from the applicable Administered REO Property to the Certificateholders (taking into account that any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) do not have any obligation under the related Intercreditor Agreement to bear the effect of any such REO Tax) or (ii) that no commercially reasonable means exists to operate such property as Administered REO Property without the Trust incurring or possibly incurring an REO Tax on income from such property, then the Special Servicer shall deliver to the Tax Administrator and the Subordinate Class Representative, in writing, a proposed plan (the “Proposed
Plan”) to manage such property as Administered REO Property.  Such plan shall include potential sources of income and good faith estimates of the amount of income from each such source.  Within a reasonable period of time after receipt of such plan, the Tax Administrator shall consult with the Special Servicer and shall advise the Special Servicer of the Trust’s federal income tax reporting position with respect to the various sources of income that the Trust would derive under the Proposed Plan.  In addition, the Tax Administrator shall (to the maximum extent reasonably possible and at a reasonable fee, which fee shall be an expense of the Trust) advise the Special Servicer of the estimated amount of taxes that the Trust would be required to pay with respect to each such source of income.  After receiving the information described in the two preceding sentences from the Tax Administrator, the Special Servicer shall either (A) implement the Proposed Plan (after
acquiring the respective Mortgaged Property as Administered REO Property) or (B) manage and operate such property in a manner that would not result in the imposition of an REO Tax on the income derived from such property.
 
Subject to Section 3.17(b), the Special Servicer’s decision as to how each Administered REO Property shall be managed and operated shall be in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Neither the applicable Special Servicer nor the Tax Administrator shall be liable to the Certificateholders, the Trustee, the Trust, the other parties hereto, any beneficiaries hereof or each other for errors in judgment made in good faith in the exercise of their discretion while performing their respective responsibilities under this Section 3.17(a) with respect to any Administered REO Property.  Nothing in this Section 3.17(a) is intended to prevent the sale of any Administered REO Property pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of Section 3.18.
 
(b)           If title to any Administered REO Property is acquired, the Special Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate such Administered REO Property for the benefit of the Certificateholders (or, in the case of any Administered REO Property related to a Serviced 
 


  


-215-





  

 
Loan Combination, on behalf of both the Certificateholders and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as a collective whole, solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale in accordance with Section 3.18, in a manner that does not cause such Administered REO Property to fail to qualify as “foreclosure property” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or, except as contemplated by Section 3.17(a), result in the receipt by any REMIC Pool of any “income from non-permitted assets” within the meaning of Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, in an Adverse REMIC Event with respect to any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event with respect to the Grantor Trust Pool.  Except as contemplated by Section 3.17(a), the
Special Servicer shall not enter into any lease, contract or other agreement with respect to any Administered REO Property that causes the Trust to receive, and (unless required to do so under any lease, contract or agreement to which the Special Servicer or the Trust may become a party or successor to a party due to a foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or other similar exercise of a creditor’s rights or remedies with respect to the related Serviced Mortgage Loan) shall not, with respect to any Administered REO Property, cause or allow the Trust to receive, any “net income from foreclosure property” that is subject to taxation under the REMIC Provisions.  Subject to the foregoing, however, the Special Servicer shall have full power and authority to do any and all things in
connection with the administration of any Administered REO Property, as are consistent with the Servicing Standard and, consistent therewith, shall withdraw from its REO Account, to the extent of amounts on deposit therein with respect to such Administered REO Property, funds necessary for the proper operation, management, maintenance and disposition of such Administered REO Property, including:

 
(i)           all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of such Administered REO Property;
 
(ii)          all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such Administered REO Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon;
 
(iii)          any ground rents in respect of such Administered REO Property; and
 
(iv)         all other costs and expenses necessary to maintain, lease, sell, protect, manage, operate and restore such Administered REO Property.
 
To the extent that amounts on deposit in the Special Servicer’s REO Account with respect to any Administered REO Property are insufficient for the purposes contemplated by the preceding sentence with respect to such REO Property, the Master Servicer shall, at the direction of the Special Servicer, but subject to Section 3.11(h), make a Servicing Advance of such amounts as are necessary for such purposes unless the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer determines, in its reasonable judgment, that such advances would, if made, be Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances; provided, that the Master Servicer may in its sole discretion make any such Servicing Advance without regard to recoverability if it is a necessary fee or expense incurred in connection with the defense or prosecution of legal proceedings.
 
(c)           The Special Servicer may, and, if required for the Administered REO Property to continue to qualify as “foreclosure property” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code, shall, contract with any Independent Contractor for the operation and management of any Administered REO Property, provided that:
 


  


-216-





  


 
(i)           the terms and conditions of any such contract may not be inconsistent herewith and shall reflect an agreement reached at arm’s length;
 
(ii)          the fees of such Independent Contractor (which shall be expenses of the Trust) shall be reasonable and customary in consideration of the nature and locality of such Administered REO Property;
 
(iii)         any such contract shall be consistent with Treasury Regulations Section 1.856-6(e)(6) and shall require, or shall be administered to require, that the Independent Contractor, in a timely manner, (A) pay all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the operation and management of such Administered REO Property, including those listed in Section 3.17(b) above, and (B) remit all related revenues collected (net of its fees and such costs and expenses) to the Special Servicer upon receipt;
 
(iv)         none of the provisions of this Section 3.17(c) relating to any such contract or to actions taken through any such Independent Contractor shall be deemed to relieve the Special Servicer of any of its duties and obligations hereunder with respect to the operation and management of any such Administered REO Property; and
 
(v)          the Special Servicer shall be obligated with respect thereto to the same extent as if it alone were performing all duties and obligations in connection with the operation and management of such Administered REO Property, and the Special Servicer shall comply with the Servicing Standard in maintaining such Independent Contractor.
 
The Special Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with any Independent Contractor performing services for it related to its duties and obligations hereunder for indemnification of the Special Servicer by such Independent Contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.  To the extent the costs of any contract with any Independent Contractor for the operation and management of any Administered REO Property are greater than the revenues available from such property, such excess costs shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.
 
(d)           Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall not:
 
(i)           permit the Trust Fund to enter into, renew or extend any New Lease with respect to any Administered REO Property, if the New Lease by its terms will give rise to any income that does not constitute Rents from Real Property;
 
(ii)          permit any amount to be received or accrued under any New Lease other than amounts that will constitute Rents from Real Property;
 
(iii)         authorize or permit any construction on any Administered REO Property, other than the repair or maintenance thereof or the completion of a building or other improvement thereon, and then only if more than 10% of the construction of such building or other improvement was completed before default on the related Mortgage Loan become imminent, all within the meaning of Section 856(e)(4)(B) of the Code; or
 


  


-217-





  


 
(iv)        except as otherwise provided for in Sections 3.17(a)(i), 3.17(a)(ii) and 3.17(a)(iii) and above, Directly Operate, or allow any other Person, other than an Independent Contractor, to Directly Operate, any Administered REO Property on any date more than ninety (90) days after its date of acquisition by or on behalf of the Trust Fund;
 
unless, in any such case, the Special Servicer has obtained an Opinion of Counsel (the cost of which shall be paid by the Master Servicer as a Servicing Advance) to the effect that such action will not cause such Administered REO Property to fail to qualify as “foreclosure property” within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code at any time that it is held for the benefit of the Trust Fund, in which case the Special Servicer may take such actions as are specified in such Opinion of Counsel.
 
(e)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Section 3.17 shall not apply to any REO Property related to a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan.
 
Section 3.18     Sale of Defaulted Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties; Sale of the Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loans.
 
(a)           The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee may sell or purchase, or permit the sale or purchase of, a Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property only (i) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 3.18, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in or contemplated by Sections 2.03 and 9.01 of this Agreement, (iii) in the case of a Mortgage Loan (or Administered REO Property related thereto) with a related mezzanine loan, in connection with a Mortgage Loan default if and as set forth in the related intercreditor agreement or (iv) in the case of a Mortgage Loan related to a Serviced Loan Combination (or REO Mortgage Loan related thereto), in connection with a Mortgage Loan default
if and as set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement.
 
(b)           Promptly upon a Serviced Mortgage Loan becoming a Defaulted Mortgage Loan and if the Special Servicer determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that it would be in the best interests of the Certificateholders, as a collective whole (or if such Defaulted Mortgage Loan is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, in the best interest of the Certificateholders and the holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as a collective whole), to attempt to sell such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (and if such Defaulted Mortgage Loan is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, to sell the entire Serviced Loan Combination), the Special Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to solicit offers for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Serviced Loan Combination on behalf of the Certificateholders (or if such Defaulted Mortgage Loan is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of the Certificateholders and
the holder of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price; provided that, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, if the Special Servicer determines to attempt to sell such Mortgage Loan it shall sell such Defaulted Mortgage Loan together with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as a whole loan pursuant to Section 3.18(e) and pursuant to the terms of the related Intercreditor Agreement.  The Special Servicer shall accept the first (and, if multiple offers are contemporaneously received, the highest) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price for such Defaulted

Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination).  During any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, the Special Servicer shall notify the Subordinate Class Representative of any inquiries or offers received regarding the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the Special Servicer shall notify the Trust Advisor of any inquiries or offers received regarding the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.

 
(c)           The Special Servicer shall give the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer, the Trust Advisor (at any time other than a Subordinate Control Period) and the Subordinate Class Representative (at any time other than during a Senior Consultation Period), the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (at any time other than during a Senior Consultation Period) not less than three (3) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to sell any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  No Interested Person shall be obligated to submit an offer to purchase any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.  In no event shall the Trustee, in its individual capacity, offer for or purchase any Defaulted Mortgage Loan.
 
(d)           Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination) for purposes of Section 3.17(b) of this Agreement shall be determined by the Special Servicer, if the highest offeror is a Person other than an Interested Person, and by the Trustee, if the highest offeror is an Interested Person; provided, that no offer from an Interested Person shall constitute a fair price unless (i) it is the highest offer received and (ii) at least two other offers are received from independent third parties.  In determining whether any offer received from an Interested Person represents a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan, (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination), the Trustee shall be supplied
with and shall rely on the most recent Appraisal or updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine (9)-month period or, in the absence of any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal.  The appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal shall be a Qualified Appraiser selected by the Special Servicer if no Interested Person is so making an offer, with respect to a Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination) and selected by the Trustee if an Interested Person is so making an offer.  The cost of any such Appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.  Where any Interested Person is among those submitting offers with respect to a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall require that all offers be submitted to the Trustee in writing and be accompanied by a refundable deposit of cash (which shall be held by the Certificate Administrator
on behalf of the Trustee) in an amount equal to 5% of the offer amount.  In determining whether any such offer from a Person other than an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination), the Special Servicer (or the Trustee, if applicable) shall take into account (in addition to the results of any Appraisal, updated Appraisal or narrative appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months), and in determining whether any offer from an Interested Person constitutes a fair price for any such Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination), any Appraiser shall be instructed to take into account, as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any delinquency on the affected Mortgage Loan, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related
Mortgaged Property and the state of the local economy.  The Trustee may conclusively rely on 
 


  


-219-





  

 
the opinion of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust Fund in connection with making such determination.  The Purchase Price for any Defaulted Mortgage Loan shall in all cases be deemed a fair price.

 
Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust Fund) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 10 years’ experience in valuing loans similar to the subject mortgage loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such mortgage loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party’s determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable
from, the Collection Account; provided that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.
 
(e)           In the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Special Servicer shall solicit offers for such Defaulted Mortgage Loan together with the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan as a whole loan and shall require that all offers be submitted to the Trustee in writing and be accompanied by a refundable deposit of cash (which shall be held by the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee) in an amount equal to 5% of the offer amount (subject to a cap of $2,500,000).  Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any such Serviced Loan Combination for purposes of Section 3.17(b) of this Agreement shall be determined by the Trustee; provided, that no offer from an Interested Person (as defined in the related Intercreditor Agreement) for a Serviced Loan Combination shall constitute
a fair price unless (i) it is the highest offer received and (ii) at least two other offers are received from independent third parties.  In determining whether any offer received represents a fair price for any such Serviced Loan Combination, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall rely on the most recent Appraisal or updated Appraisal conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine (9)-month period or, in the absence of any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal.  The Trustee shall select the Appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal.  The cost of any such Appraisal shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance.  In determining whether any such offer from a Person constitutes a fair price for any such Serviced Loan Combination, the Trustee shall instruct the Appraiser to take into account (in addition to the results of any Appraisal and updated Appraisal that it may have obtained pursuant to this Agreement within the
prior nine (9) months), as applicable, among other factors, the period and amount of any delinquency on the affected Serviced Loan Combination, the occupancy level and physical condition of the related Mortgaged Property and the state of the local economy.  The Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust Fund in connection with making such determination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Special Servicer shall not be permitted to sell the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan without the written consent of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder unless the Special Servicer has delivered to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder:  (a) at least 15 Business Days prior written notice of any decision to attempt to sell the Serviced Loan 
 


  


-220-





  

 
Combination; (b) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale, a copy of each bid package (together with any amendments to such bid packages) received by the Special Servicer in connection with any such proposed sale, (c) at least 10 days prior to the proposed sale, a copy of the most recent Appraisal for the Serviced Loan Combination, and any documents in the Servicing File requested by the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder and (d) until the sale is completed, and a reasonable period of time (but no less time than is afforded to other offerors and the Subordinate Class Representative) prior to the proposed sale date, all information and other documents being provided to other offerors and all leases or other documents that are approved by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer in connection with the proposed sale; provided that the related Non-Serviced Companion Loan Holder may waive any
of the delivery or timing requirements set forth in this sentence. Subject to the foregoing, each of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period), the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder or a representative thereof shall be permitted to bid at any sale of the Mortgage Loan.

 
Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding paragraph to the contrary, if the Trustee is required to determine whether a cash offer by an Interested Person constitutes a fair price, the Trustee may (at its option and at the expense of the Trust Fund) designate an independent third party expert in real estate or commercial mortgage loan matters with at least 10 years’ experience in valuing loans similar to the subject mortgage loan, that has been selected with reasonable care by the Trustee to determine if such cash offer constitutes a fair price for such mortgage loan.  If the Trustee designates such a third party to make such determination, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively upon such third party’s determination.  The reasonable costs of all appraisals, inspection reports and broker opinions of value incurred by any such third party pursuant to this paragraph shall be covered by, and shall be reimbursable
from, the Collection Account; provided that, the Trustee shall not engage a third party expert whose fees exceed a commercially reasonable amount as determined by the Trustee.
 
(f)           The Special Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, consistent with the Servicing Standard, to solicit cash offers for each Administered REO Property in such manner as will be reasonably likely to realize a fair price (determined pursuant to Section 3.18(g) below) for any Administered REO Property within a customary and normal time frame for the sale of comparable properties (and, in any event, within the time period provided for by Section 3.16(a)).  The Special Servicer shall accept the first (and, if multiple cash offers are received by a specified offer date, the highest) cash offer received from any Person that constitutes a fair price (determined pursuant to Section 3.18(g) below) for such Administered REO Property.  If the Special Servicer reasonably
believes that it will be unable to realize a fair price (determined pursuant to Section 3.18(g) below) with respect to any Administered REO Property within the time constraints imposed by Section 3.16(a), then the Special Servicer shall, consistent with the Servicing Standard, dispose of such Administered REO Property upon such terms and conditions as it shall deem necessary and desirable to maximize the recovery thereon under the circumstances.
 
The Special Servicer shall give the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder not less than five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice of its intention to sell any Administered REO Property pursuant to this Section 3.18(f).
 


  


-221-





  


 
No Mortgage Loan Seller, Certificateholder or any Affiliate of any such Person shall be obligated to submit an offer to purchase any Administered REO Property, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Trustee, in its individual capacity, may not offer for or purchase any Administered REO Property pursuant hereto.
 
(g)           Whether any cash offer constitutes a fair price for any Administered REO Property for purposes of Section 3.18(f), shall be determined by the Special Servicer or, if such cash offer is from the Special Servicer or any Affiliate of the Special Servicer, by the Trustee.  In determining whether any offer received from the Special Servicer or an Affiliate of the Special Servicer represents a fair price for any Administered REO Property, the Trustee shall be supplied with and shall be entitled to rely on the most recent Appraisal in the related Servicing File conducted in accordance with this Agreement within the preceding nine-month period (or, in the absence of any such Appraisal or if there has been a material change at the subject property since any such Appraisal, on a new Appraisal to be obtained by the Special Servicer, the cost of which shall be
covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance).  The appraiser conducting any such new Appraisal shall be a Qualified Appraiser that is (i) selected by the Special Servicer if neither the Special Servicer nor any Affiliate thereof is submitted an offer with respect to the subject Administered REO Property and (ii) selected by the Trustee if either the Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof is so submitting an offer.  Where any Mortgage Loan Seller, any Certificateholder or any Affiliate of any such Person is among those submitting offers with respect to any Administered REO Property, the Special Servicer shall require that all offers be submitted to it (or, if the Special Servicer or an Affiliate thereof is submitting an offer, be submitted to the Trustee) in writing and be accompanied by a refundable deposit of cash (which shall be held by the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee) in an amount equal to 5% of the offer amount.  In determining
whether any offer from a Person other than any Mortgage Loan Seller, any Certificateholder or any Affiliate of any such Person constitutes a fair price for any Administered REO Property, the Special Servicer (or the Trustee, if applicable) shall take into account the results of any Appraisal or updated Appraisal that it or the Master Servicer may have obtained in accordance with this Agreement within the prior nine (9) months, as well as, among other factors, the occupancy level and physical condition of such Administered REO Property, the state of the then current local economy and commercial real estate market where such Administered REO Property is located and the obligation to dispose of such Administered REO Property within a customary and normal time frame for the sale of comparable properties (and, in any event, within the time period specified in Section 3.16(a)).  The Trustee may conclusively rely on the opinion
of an Independent appraiser or other Independent expert in real estate matters retained by the Trustee at the expense of the Trust Fund in connection with making any such determination.  The Purchase Price for any Administered REO Property (which, in connection with an Administered REO Property related to a Serviced Loan Combination, shall be construed and calculated with respect to the entire Serviced Loan Combination) shall in all cases be deemed a fair price.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 3.18, no cash offer from the Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof shall constitute a fair price for any Administered REO Property unless such offer is the highest cash offer received and at least two Independent offers (not including the offer of the Special Servicer or any Affiliate) have been received.  In the event the offer of the Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof is the
only offer received or is the higher of only two offers received, then additional offers shall be solicited.  If an additional offer or offers, as the case may be, are received for any Administered REO Property and the original offer of the Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof is the highest of all 
 


  


-222-





  

 
offers received, then the offer of the Special Servicer or such Affiliate shall be accepted, provided that the Trustee has otherwise determined, as provided above in this Section 3.18(f), that such offer constitutes a fair price for the subject Administered REO Property.  Any offer by the Special Servicer for any Administered REO Property shall be unconditional; and, if accepted, the subject Administered REO Property shall be transferred to the Special Servicer without recourse, representation or warranty other than customary representations as to title given in connection with the sale of a real property.

 
(h)           Subject to Section 3.18(a) through 3.18(g) above, the Special Servicer shall act on behalf of the Trust in negotiating with Independent third parties in connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property and taking any other action necessary or appropriate in connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property, and the collection of all amounts payable in connection therewith.  In connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property, the Special Servicer may charge prospective offerors, and may retain, fees that approximate the Special Servicer’s actual costs in the preparation and delivery of information pertaining to such sales or evaluating offers without obligation to deposit such amounts into the Collection
Account; provided that if the Special Servicer was previously reimbursed for such costs from the Collection Account, then the Special Servicer must deposit such amounts into the Collection Account.  Any sale of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or any Administered REO Property shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee or the Trust, and if such sale is consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, neither the Special Servicer nor the Trustee shall have any liability to any Certificateholder with respect to the purchase price therefor accepted by the Special Servicer or the Trustee.
 
(i)           Any sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property shall be for cash only.  The Special Servicer in its capacity as Special Servicer shall have no authority to provide financing to the purchaser.
 
(j)           With respect to any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan that becomes a “Defaulted Mortgage Loan” (as such term or other similar term is defined pursuant to the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and construed as if such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan were a “Mortgage Loan” under such Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), the liquidation of such Non-Trust Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan shall be administered by the related Non-Trust Special Servicer in accordance with the Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the related Intercreditor Agreement.  Any such sale of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan pursuant to the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement and/or the related Intercreditor Agreement shall be final and without recourse to the Trustee or the Trust, and none of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall
have any liability to any Certificateholder with respect to the purchase price for such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan accepted on behalf of the Trust.
 
(k)           If any Defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property is sold under this Section 3.18, or a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan is sold in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then the purchase price shall be deposited into the Collection Account or, if applicable, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account, and the Trustee, upon receipt of 
 


  


-223-





  

 
written notice from the Master Servicer to the effect that such deposit has been made (based upon, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan or REO Property, notification by the Special Servicer to the Master Servicer of the amount of the purchase price), shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as shall be provided to it and are reasonably necessary to vest ownership of such Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property in the Person who purchased such Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property.

 
(l)           Any purchaser of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that has a related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, whether pursuant to this Section 3.18 or pursuant to Section 2.03 or Section 9.01, will be subject to the related Intercreditor Agreement, including any requirements thereof governing who may be a holder of such Mortgage Loan.  The Special Servicer will require, in connection with such a sale of such a Defaulted Mortgage Loan, that the purchaser assume in writing all of the rights and obligations of the holder of such Mortgage Loan under the related Intercreditor Agreement.
 
(m)          In connection with the sale of any Defaulted Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan) under the provisions described in this Section 3.18 for an amount less than the Purchase Price, the Special Servicer shall obtain the approval of the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or consult with the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Collective Consultation Period) and the Special Servicer shall consult with the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period), subject to the Special Servicer’s prevailing duty to comply with the Servicing Standard.  In addition, in considering such a sale, the Special Servicer shall consider the interests only of the Certificateholders and, in the case of a Defaulted Mortgage Loan that is part
of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (as a collective whole, as if they together constituted a single lender).
 
Section 3.19     Additional Obligations of Master Servicer and Special Servicer.
 
(a)           Within sixty (60) days (or within such longer period as the Special Servicer is (as certified thereby to the Trustee in writing) diligently using reasonable efforts to obtain the Appraisal referred to below) after the earliest of the date on which any Serviced Mortgage Loan (i) becomes a Modified Mortgage Loan following the occurrence of a Servicing Transfer Event, (ii) becomes an REO Mortgage Loan, (iii) with respect to which a receiver or similar official is appointed and continues for sixty (60) days in such capacity in respect of the related Mortgaged Property, (iv) the related Borrower becomes the subject of bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings or, if such proceedings are involuntary, such proceedings remain undismissed for sixty (60) days, (v) any Monthly Payment (other than a Balloon Payment) becomes sixty (60) days or more delinquent, or (vi) the related Borrower fails to make
when due any Balloon Payment and the Borrower does not deliver to the Master Servicer, on or before the Due Date of the Balloon Payment, a written refinancing commitment from an acceptable lender and reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Master Servicer which provides that such refinancing will occur within 120 days after the date on which the Balloon Payment will become due (provided that if either such refinancing does not occur during that time or the Master Servicer is required during that time to make any P&I Advance in respect of the Mortgage Loan, an Appraisal Trigger Event will occur immediately) (each such event, an “Appraisal Trigger Event” and each such Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related REO 
 


  


-224-





  

 
Mortgage Loan that is the subject of an Appraisal Trigger Event, until it ceases to be such in accordance with the following paragraph, a “Required Appraisal Loan”), the Special Servicer shall obtain an Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property, unless an Appraisal thereof had previously been received (or, if applicable, conducted) within the prior nine (9) months and the Special Servicer has no knowledge of changed circumstances that in the Special Servicer’s reasonable judgment would materially affect the value of the Mortgaged Property.  If such Appraisal is obtained from a Qualified Appraiser, the cost thereof shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance, such Advance to be made at the direction of the Special Servicer when the Appraisal is received by the Special Servicer.  Promptly following the receipt of, and based upon, such Appraisal and receipt of information requested
by the Special Servicer from the Master Servicer pursuant to the last paragraph of this Section 3.19(a), the Special Servicer, in consultation with (i) the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or (ii) one or more of the Subordinate Class Representative and the Trust Advisor, under the procedures set forth in Section 3.28(d) and (e) (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period), shall determine and report to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Master Servicer the then applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the subject Required Appraisal Loan.  For purposes of this Section 3.19(a), an Appraisal may, in the case of any Serviced Mortgage Loan with an aggregate outstanding
principal balance of less than $2,000,000 only, consist solely of an internal valuation performed by the Special Servicer.  In connection with a Mortgaged Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the Special Servicer shall also determine and report to the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder the Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the entire such Serviced Loan Combination (calculated, for purposes of this sentence, as if it were a single Mortgage Loan).

 
A Serviced Mortgage Loan shall cease to be a Required Appraisal Loan if and when, following the occurrence of the most recent Appraisal Trigger Event, any and all Servicing Transfer Events with respect to such Mortgage Loan have ceased to exist and no other Appraisal Trigger Event has occurred with respect thereto during the preceding ninety (90) days.
 
For so long as any Serviced Mortgage Loan or related REO Mortgage Loan remains a Required Appraisal Loan, the Special Servicer shall, every nine (9) months after such Mortgage Loan becomes a Required Appraisal Loan, obtain (or, if such Required Appraisal Loan has a Stated Principal Balance of $2,000,000 or less, at the Special Servicer’s option, conduct) an update of the prior Appraisal.  If such update is obtained from a Qualified Appraiser, the cost thereof shall be covered by, and be reimbursable as, a Servicing Advance, such Advance to be made at the direction of the Special Servicer when the Appraisal is received by the Special Servicer.  Promptly following the receipt of, and based upon, such update, the Special Servicer shall redetermine, in consultation with (i) the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period) or (ii) one or more of the Subordinate Class Representative and
the Trust Advisor, under the procedures set forth in Section 3.28(d) and (e) (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period), and report to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Master Servicer, the then applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the subject Required Appraisal Loan.  In connection with a Mortgaged Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, promptly following the receipt of, and based upon, such update, the Special Servicer shall also redetermine, and report to the Trustee, the Master 
 


  


-225-





  

 
Servicer, the Subordinate Class Representative and related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) the Appraisal Reduction Amount, if any, with respect to the entire such Serviced Loan Combination (calculated, for purposes of this sentence, as if it were a single Mortgage Loan).

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the final paragraph of this Section 3.19(a), solely for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect (and the identity of the Subordinate Class), whenever the Special Servicer is required to obtain an Appraisal or updated Appraisal under this Agreement, the Subordinate Class Representative shall have the right, exercisable within ten (10) Business Days after the Special Servicer’s report of the resulting Appraisal Reduction Amount, to direct the Special Servicer to hire a Qualified Appraiser reasonably satisfactory to the Subordinate Class Representative to prepare a second Appraisal of the Mortgaged Property at the expense of the Subordinate Class Representative.  The Special Servicer must use reasonable efforts to cause the delivery of such second Appraisal within
thirty (30) days following the direction of the Subordinate Class Representative and receipt of information requested from the Master Servicer reasonably required to perform such second Appraisal.  Within ten (10) Business Days following its receipt of such second Appraisal, the Special Servicer shall determine, in accordance with the Servicing Standard, whether, based on its assessment of such second Appraisal, any recalculation of the Appraisal Reduction Amount is warranted and, if so, the Special Servicer shall recalculate the applicable Appraisal Reduction Amount on the basis of such second Appraisal and receipt of information requested by the Special Servicer from the Master Servicer pursuant to the last paragraph of this Section 3.19(a).  Solely for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect and the identity of the Subordinate Class:
 
(i)           the first Appraisal shall be disregarded and have no force or effect, and, if an Appraisal Reduction Amount is already then in effect, the Appraisal Reduction Amount for the related Mortgage Loan shall be calculated on the basis of the most recent prior Appraisal or updated Appraisal obtained under this Agreement (or, if no such Appraisal exists, there shall be no Appraisal Reduction Amount for purposes of determining whether a Subordinate Control Period is in effect and the identity of the Subordinate Class) unless and until the (a) the Subordinate Class Representative fails to exercise its right to direct the Special Servicer to obtain a second Appraisal within the exercise period described above or (b) if the Subordinate Class Representative exercises its right to direct the Special Servicer to obtain a second Appraisal, such second Appraisal is not received by the Special Servicer within ninety (90) days
following such direction, whichever occurs earlier (and, in such event, an Appraisal Reduction Amount calculated on the basis of such first Appraisal, if any, shall be effective); and
 
(ii)          if the Subordinate Class Representative exercises its right to direct the Special Servicer to obtain a second Appraisal and such second Appraisal is received by the Special Servicer within ninety (90) days following such direction, the Appraisal Reduction Amount (if any), calculated on the basis of the second Appraisal (if the Special Servicer determines that a recalculation was warranted as described above) or (otherwise) on the basis of the first Appraisal shall be effective.
 
In addition, if there is a material change with respect to any of the Mortgaged Properties related to a Serviced Mortgage Loan with respect to which an Appraisal Reduction 
 


  


-226-





  

 
Amount has been calculated, then (i) during any Subordinate Control Period, the Holder (or group of Holders) of Certificates representing a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights of the Classes of Principal Balance Certificates reduced by Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated thereto to less than 25% of the initial Class Principal Balance of each such Class and (ii) during any Collective Consultation Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, shall have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to present to the Special Servicer an additional Appraisal prepared by a Qualified Appraiser on an “as-is” basis and acceptable to the Special Servicer in accordance with the Servicing Standard.  Subject to the Special Servicer’s confirmation, determined in accordance with the Servicing Standard, that there has been a change with respect to the related Mortgaged Property and such change was material, the Special Servicer shall recalculate
such Appraisal Reduction Amount based upon such additional Appraisal and updated information.  If required by any such recalculation, any applicable Class of Principal Balance Certificates notionally reduced by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts allocated to such Class shall have its related Certificate Principal Balance notionally restored to the extent required by such recalculation, and there shall be a redetermination of whether a Subordinate Control Period or a Collective Consultation Period is then in effect.  With respect to each Class of Control Eligible Certificates, the right to present the Special Servicer with any such additional Appraisals as provided above is limited to no more frequently than once in any 12-month period for each Serviced Mortgage Loan with respect to which an Appraisal Reduction Amount has been calculated.

 
With respect to any Appraisal Reduction Amount calculated for the purposes of determining the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the existence of a Subordinate Control Period, Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period and, if applicable, the allocation of Voting Rights among the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates, (i) the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property used to calculate the Appraisal Reduction Amount shall be determined on an “as-is” basis and (ii) the Appraisal Reduction Amount so calculated shall be notionally allocable between the respective Classes of Principal Balance Certificates in reverse order of their alphanumeric designations (in each case until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof is notionally reduced to zero) and the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest shall be treated as a single
Class in such notional allocation.
 
The Master Servicer shall deliver by electronic mail to the Special Servicer any information in the Master Servicer’s possession that is reasonably required to determine, calculate, redetermine or recalculate any Appraisal Reduction Amount or updated Appraisal Reduction Amount pursuant to the definition thereof, using reasonable best efforts to deliver such information, within four (4) Business Days following the Special Servicer’s request therefor (which request shall be made promptly, but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days, after the Special Servicer’s receipt of the applicable Appraisal or preparation of the applicable internal valuation); provided, the Special Servicer’s failure to timely make such request shall not relieve the Master Servicer of its obligation to provide such information to the Special Servicer in the manner and timing set forth in this sentence.
 
(b)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other Section of this Agreement, the Special Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer whenever a Servicing Advance is required to be made with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or 
 


  


-227-





  

 
Administered REO Property, and, the Master Servicer shall (subject to Section 3.11(h)) make such Servicing Advance; provided that the Special Servicer shall make any Servicing Advance (other than a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance) on a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property that constitutes an Emergency Advance.  Each such notice and request shall be made, in writing, not less than five (5) Business Days or, in the case of an Emergency Advance, not later than two (2) Business Days (provided the request sets forth the nature of the emergency), in advance of the date on which the subject Servicing Advance is to be made and shall be accompanied by such information and documentation regarding the subject Servicing Advance as the Master Servicer may reasonably request; provided, that the Special
Servicer shall not be entitled to make such a request more frequently than once per calendar month with respect to Servicing Advances other than Emergency Advances (although such request may relate to more than one Servicing Advance).  The Master Servicer shall have the obligation to make any such Servicing Advance (other than a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance) that it is so requested by the Special Servicer to make (as described above) not later than the date on which the subject Servicing Advance is to be made, but in no event shall it be required to make any Servicing Advance on a date that is earlier than five (5) Business Days or, in the case of an Emergency Advance, on a date that is earlier than two (2) Business Days, following the Master Servicer’s receipt of such request.  If the request is timely and properly made, the requesting Special Servicer shall be relieved of any obligations with respect to a Servicing Advance that it so requests the Master Servicer
to make with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or Administered REO Property (regardless of whether or not the Master Servicer shall make such Servicing Advance).  The Master Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for any Servicing Advance made by it at the direction of the Special Servicer, together with Advance Interest in accordance with Sections 3.05(a) and 3.11(g), at the same time, in the same manner and to the same extent as the Master Servicer is entitled with respect to any other Servicing Advances made thereby.  Any request by the Special Servicer that the Master Servicer make a Servicing Advance shall be deemed to be a determination by the Special Servicer that such Servicing Advance is not a Nonrecoverable Advance, on which deemed determination the Master Servicer is entitled to rely.  The preceding statement shall not be construed
to limit the right of the Special Servicer under Section 3.11(i) with respect to the payment of any servicing expense that, if advanced, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance.  If the Special Servicer makes an Emergency Advance, the Master Servicer shall reimburse the Special Servicer for such Emergency Advance (with Advance Interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate) within five (5) Business Days following the Special Servicer’s request for reimbursement, upon which reimbursement the Master Servicer will be deemed to have made such Emergency Advance when the Special Servicer made such Emergency Advance.

 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.19(b), the Master Servicer shall not be required to reimburse the Special Servicer for, or to make at the direction of the Special Servicer, any Servicing Advance if the Master Servicer determines in its reasonable judgment that such Servicing Advance, although not characterized by the Special Servicer as a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance, is in fact a Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance.  The Master Servicer shall notify the Special Servicer in writing of such determination and, if applicable, such Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance shall be reimbursed to the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 3.05(a).

Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan for which such Master Servicing Fees are being paid in the related Collection Period, calculated for this purpose at one (1) basis point (0.01%) per annum, and (B) all Prepayment Interest Excesses received by the Master Servicer during the related Collection Period; provided that the Master Servicer shall pay (without regard to clause (ii) above) the amount of any Prepayment Interest Shortfall otherwise described in clause (i) above incurred in connection with any Principal Prepayment received in respect of a Serviced Mortgage Loan during the related Collection Period to the extent such Prepayment Interest Shortfall occurs as a result of the Master Servicer allowing the related Borrower to deviate from the terms of the related Mortgage Loan Documents regarding Principal Prepayments (other than (w) subsequent to a default under the related Mortgage
Loan Documents, (x) pursuant to applicable law or a court order (including in connection with amounts collected as Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the extent that such applicable law or court order limits the ability of the Master Servicer to apply the proceeds in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan Documents), (y)  at the request or with the consent of the Special Servicer, or (z) during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, at the request or with the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative).
 
The rights of the Certificateholders to offsets of any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls shall not be cumulative from Collection Period to Collection Period.
 
(d)           With respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan that is to be defeased in accordance with its terms, the Master Servicer shall execute and deliver to each Rating Agency (subject to Section 3.27) a certification substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit N and, further, shall, to the extent permitted by the terms of such Mortgage Loan, require the related Borrower (i) to provide replacement collateral consisting of U.S. government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act in an amount sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan (or defeased portion thereof) when due (and assuming, in the case of an ARD Mortgage Loan, to the extent consistent with the related Mortgage Loan Documents, that the subject ARD Mortgage Loan matures
on its Anticipated Repayment Date), (ii) to deliver a certificate from an independent certified public accounting firm certifying that the replacement collateral is sufficient to make such payments, (iii) at the option of the Master Servicer, to designate a single purpose entity (which may be (but is not required to be) a subsidiary of the Master Servicer established for the purpose of assuming all defeased Serviced Mortgage Loans) to assume the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan (or defeased portion thereof) and own the defeasance collateral, (iv) to implement such defeasance only after the second anniversary of the Closing Date, (v) to provide an Opinion of Counsel that the Trustee has a perfected, first priority security interest in the new collateral, and (vi) in the

case of a partial defeasance of the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan, to defease a principal amount equal to at least 125% of the allocated loan amount for the Mortgaged Property or Properties to be released; provided that, if (A) the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Principal Balance greater than or equal to $35,000,000 or an outstanding principal balance greater than or equal to 2% of the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool or is one of the ten largest Mortgage Loans then in the Trust Fund, (B) the terms of the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan do not permit the Master Servicer to impose the foregoing requirements and the Master Servicer does not satisfy such requirements on its own or (C) the Master Servicer is unable to execute and deliver the certification attached hereto as Exhibit N in connection with the subject defeasance, then the Master
Servicer shall so notify the Rating Agencies (subject to Section 3.27), the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and, if any Mortgage Loan in a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) and, so long as such a requirement would not violate applicable law or the Servicing Standard, obtain a Rating Agency Confirmation (subject to Section 3.27) with respect to such defeasance.  Subject to the related Mortgage Loan Documents and applicable law, the Master Servicer shall not permit a defeasance unless (i) the subject Serviced Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to pay (or the Borrower in fact pays) all Rating Agency fees associated with defeasance (if a Rating Agency Confirmation is a specific condition precedent thereto) and all expenses associated
with defeasance or other arrangements for payment of such costs are made at no expense to the Trust Fund or the Master Servicer (provided, that in no event shall such proposed other arrangements result in any liability to the Trust Fund including any indemnification of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer which may result in legal expenses to the Trust Fund), and (ii) the Borrower is required to provide all Opinions of Counsel, including Opinions of Counsel that the defeasance will not cause an Adverse REMIC Event or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event and that the related Mortgage Loan Documents are fully enforceable in accordance with their terms (subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar standard exceptions), and any applicable Rating Agency Confirmations.

 
(e)           In connection with the Serviced Mortgage Loans or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan for which the related Borrower was required to escrow funds or post a Letter of Credit related to obtaining performance objectives, such as targeted debt service coverage levels or leasing criteria with respect to the Mortgaged Property as a whole or particular portions thereof, if the mortgagee has the discretion to retain the cash or Letter of Credit (or the proceeds of such Letters of Credit) as additional collateral if the relevant conditions to release are not satisfied, then the Master Servicer shall hold such escrows or Letters of Credit (or the proceeds of such Letters of Credit) as additional collateral and not use such funds to reduce the principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan (to the extent the related Mortgage Loan Documents allow such action), unless holding such funds
would otherwise be inconsistent with the Servicing Standard.

related payment of principal, interest or other amount payable thereunder or, in the reasonable judgment of the Special Servicer, would materially impair the security for such Mortgage Loan, unless a material default on such Mortgage Loan has occurred or, in the reasonable judgment of the Special Servicer, a default with respect to payment on such Mortgage Loan or Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan at maturity or on an earlier date is reasonably foreseeable, or the Special Servicer reasonably believes that there is a significant risk of such a default, and, in either case, such modification, waiver, amendment or other action is reasonably likely to produce an equal or a greater recovery to Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as a collective whole, on a present value basis (the relevant discounting of anticipated collections that

(e)           Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders (and, in the case of a Sub-Servicing Agreement related to a Serviced Loan Combination, for the benefit of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), shall (at no expense to any other party hereto or to the Certificateholders or the Trust) monitor the performance and enforce the obligations of their respective Sub-Servicers under the related Sub-Servicing Agreements.  Such enforcement, including the legal prosecution of claims, termination of Sub-Servicing Agreements in accordance with their respective terms and the pursuit of other appropriate remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such an extent and at such time as the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonable judgment, would require were it the owner of the subject Mortgage Loans. Subject to
the terms of the related Sub-Servicing Agreement, including any provisions thereof limiting the ability of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, to terminate a Sub-Servicer, each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall have the right to remove a Sub-Servicer retained by it at any time it considers such removal to be in the best interests of Certificateholders (and/or, in the case of a Sub-Servicer for a Serviced Loan Combination, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s)), as applicable.

(h)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, any account established and maintained by a Sub-Servicer pursuant to a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the Master Servicer shall for all purposes under this Agreement be deemed to be an account established and maintained by the Master Servicer.
 
(i)           Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of the foregoing subsections of this Section 3.22, the appointment by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer of one or more third-party contractors for the purpose of performing discrete, ministerial functions shall not constitute the appointment of Sub-Servicers and shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section 3.22; provided, that (a) the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall remain responsible for the actions of such third-party contractors as if it were alone performing such functions and shall pay all fees and expenses of such third-party contractors; (b) such appointment imposes no additional duty on any other party to this Agreement, any successor hereunder to the Master

(k)           Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, immediately upon the effectiveness of any resignation or termination of the Master Servicer under this Agreement or any other transaction in which a Person becomes the Master Servicer hereunder, the successor Master Servicer (including, without limitation, the Trustee if its assumes the servicing obligations of the Master Servicer) shall be deemed to automatically have assumed and agreed to the terms and provisions of each Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement without any further action.  No Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement shall be deemed to be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement solely as a result of its recognition of the provisions, or its inclusion of provisions to the effect, set forth in the preceding sentence.  If a task, right or obligation of the Master Servicer is delegated to a Designated Sub-Servicer
under a Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement, and such task, right or obligation involves or requires the consent of the Special Servicer, then the Special Servicer shall accept the performance of such task, right or obligation by the Designated Sub-Servicer only in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including without limitation any time periods for consent or deemed consent to be observed by the Special Servicer) as if the Master Servicer were performing it.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the Special Servicer is neither a party to any Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement, nor is it bound by any provision of any Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.  The Special Servicer hereby acknowledges the delegation of rights and duties hereunder by the Master Servicer pursuant to the provisions of each Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 3.22(k) shall
affect the Master Servicer’s obligations under this Section 3.22 to monitor the performance and enforce the obligations of a Designated Sub-Servicer under the related Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement, imposes any additional liability on the Special Servicer for the actions or inactions of a Designated Sub-Servicer or imposes on the Special Servicer any obligation to monitor the performance and enforce the obligations of the Designated Sub-Servicer under the related Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.  Each Designated Sub-Servicer shall be a third party beneficiary of this subsection (k).  In no event shall this subsection (k) be construed to impose liability on the Trust Fund or the Special Servicer for the failure of the Master Servicer, or any successor Master Servicer, to perform its duties under any Designated Sub-Servicing Agreement.
 
Section 3.23     Subordinate Class Representative.
 
(a)           The Majority Subordinate Certificateholder shall have a continuing right, subject to and in accordance with this Section 3.23, to appoint a representative (the “Subordinate Class Representative”) having the rights and powers specified in this Agreement (including those specified in Section 3.24)¸ and/or remove or replace any existing Subordinate Class Representative, by delivering notice to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer and, in the case of a removal or replacement of a Subordinate Class Representative, the then existing Subordinate Class Representative; provided, that Eightfold Real Estate Capital Fund II, L.P. shall be the initial Subordinate Class Representative.  Such continuing

each be entitled to rely on such information provided by the Certificate Administrator with respect to any obligation or right hereunder that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, may have to deliver information or otherwise communicate with the Subordinate Class Representative.  In addition to the foregoing, within two (2) Business Days of its receipt of notice of the resignation or removal of a Subordinate Class Representative, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the other parties to this Agreement of such event.
 
(d)           A Subordinate Class Representative may at any time resign as such by giving written notice to the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, which shall thereupon give written notice to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer.  The effectiveness of such resignation shall not be conditioned upon or subject to the prior appointment or approval of a successor to the resigning Subordinate Class Representative.  In no event shall the failure of the Subordinate Class Representative or the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder to provide such notice prejudice or call into question the effectiveness of such resignation.  The preceding statement shall not be construed to limit the effect of subsection (e).
 
(e)           Once a Subordinate Class Representative has been selected pursuant to this Section 3.23, each of the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to rely on such selection unless the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder or such Subordinate Class Representative, as applicable, shall have notified the Certificate Administrator and each other party to this Agreement, in writing, of the resignation or removal of such Subordinate Class Representative.
 
(f)           Any and all expenses of the Subordinate Class Representative shall be borne by the Holders (or, if applicable, the Certificate Owners) of Certificates of the Subordinate Class, pro rata according to their respective Percentage Interests in such Class, and not by the Trust.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a claim is made against the Subordinate Class Representative by a Borrower with respect to this Agreement or any particular Mortgage Loan, the Subordinate Class Representative shall immediately notify the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, whereupon (if the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust are also named parties to the same action and, in the sole judgment of the Special Servicer, (i) the Subordinate Class Representative had acted in good faith, without negligence
or willful misfeasance, with regard to 
 


  


-244-





  

 
the particular matter at issue, and (ii) there is no potential for the Special Servicer, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust to be an adverse party in such action as regards the Subordinate Class Representative, the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust shall, subject to Section 6.03 and the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative, assume, at the expense of the Trust Fund, the defense of any such claim against the Subordinate Class Representative; provided, that no judgment against the Subordinate Class Representative shall be payable out of the Trust Fund.  This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the termination or resignation of any Subordinate Class Representative.

 
(g)           The Subordinate Class Representative may receive amounts payable to the Special Servicer as special servicing compensation as described in and to the extent as the Special Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative may agree.

and (ii) certifies to the Depositor, Certificate Administrator, Trustee, Master Servicer, Special Servicer and Trust Advisor that (a) the Opting-Out Party retains no direct or indirect voting rights with respect to the Class E Certificates that it does not own, (b) there is no voting agreement between the Opting-Out Party and the transferee and (c) the Opting-Out Party retains no direct or indirect economic interest in the Class E Certificates (such sale, a “Transfer”).  Following any such Transfer the successor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder shall again have the rights of the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder as set forth herein (including the rights to appoint a Subordinate Class Representative or cause the exercise of the rights of the Subordinate Class Representative) without regard to any prior waiver by the predecessor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder.  The successor Majority Subordinate Certificateholder shall also have

Section 3.24     Asset Status Reports and Certain Rights and Powers of the Subordinate Class Representative.
 
(a)           No later than forty-five (45) days after a Servicing Transfer Event for a Serviced Mortgage Loan, the Special Servicer shall deliver in electronic format a report (the “Asset Status Report”) with respect to such Serviced Mortgage Loan and the related Mortgaged Property to the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (if any) (only to the extent such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is expressly entitled to receive such Asset Status Report under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the subject of the Asset Status Report does not involve a sale or proposed sale of the Mortgage Loan), the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder (during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period), the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation
Period or Senior Consultation Period) and the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such report on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)).  Such Asset Status Report shall set forth the following information to the extent reasonably determinable:
 
(i)           a summary of the status of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and any negotiations with the related Borrower;
 
(ii)          a discussion of the general legal and environmental considerations reasonably known to the Special Servicer (including without limitation by reason of any Phase I Environmental Assessment and any additional environmental testing contemplated by Section 3.09(c)), consistent with the Servicing Standard, that are applicable to the exercise of remedies set forth herein and to the enforcement of any related guaranties or other collateral for the related Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and whether outside legal counsel has been retained;
 
(iii)          the most current rent roll and income or operating statement available for the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties;
 
(iv)         a summary of the Special Servicer’s recommended action with respect to such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan;
 
(v)         the Appraised Value of the related Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged Properties, together with the assumptions used in the calculation thereof (which the Special Servicer may satisfy by providing a copy of the most recently obtained Appraisal); and
 
(vi)         such other information as the Special Servicer deems relevant in light of the Servicing Standard.
 
During a Subordinate Control Period, if the Subordinate Class Representative does not disapprove an Asset Status Report within ten (10) Business Days (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such longer period of time as may be set forth in the related 
 


  


-246-





  

 
Intercreditor Agreement) of receipt, the Special Servicer shall implement the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report.  In addition, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative may object to any Asset Status Report within ten (10) Business Days of receipt (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such longer period of time as may be set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement); provided, that the Special Servicer shall implement the recommended action as outlined in the Asset Status Report if it makes a determination in accordance with the Servicing Standard that the objection is not in the best interest of all the Certificateholders (as a collective whole, as if they together constituted a single lender).  If, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative disapproves the Asset Status Report and the Special Servicer
has not made the affirmative determination described above, the Special Servicer shall revise the Asset Status Report and deliver a new Asset Status Report as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after the disapproval, to the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (if any) (only to the extent such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder is expressly entitled to receive such Asset Status Report under the related Intercreditor Agreement and the subject of the Asset Status Report does not involve a sale or proposed sale of the Mortgage Loan) and the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider (who shall promptly post such revised Asset Status Report on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)).  During
a Subordinate Control Period, the Special Servicer shall revise the Asset Status Report until the Subordinate Class Representative fails to disapprove the revised Asset Status Report as described above, until the Subordinate Class Representative’s approval is no longer required or until the Special Servicer makes a determination that the objection is not in the best interests of all the Certificateholders (as a collective whole, as if they together constituted a single lender).  If, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Special Servicer have not agreed upon an Asset Status Report within ninety (90) days following the Subordinate Class Representative’s receipt of the initial Asset Status Report, the Special Servicer shall implement the actions described in the most recent Asset Status Report submitted by the Special Servicer to the Subordinate Class Representative.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Special Servicer determines
that emergency action is necessary to protect the related Mortgaged Property or the interests of the Certificateholders, or if a failure to take any such action at such time would be inconsistent with the Servicing Standard, the Special Servicer may take actions with respect to the related Mortgaged Property before the expiration of the ten (10) Business Day period (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, such longer period of time as may be set forth in the related Intercreditor Agreement) referenced above and if the Special Servicer reasonably determines in accordance with the Servicing Standard that failure to take such actions before the expiration of such period would materially and adversely affect the interest of the Certificateholders and the Special Servicer has made commercially reasonable efforts, during a Subordinate Control Period, to contact the Subordinate Class Representative.  The foregoing shall not relieve the Special Servicer of its duties
to comply with the Servicing Standard.

 
The Special Servicer may, from time to time, modify any Asset Status Report it has previously delivered and implement such report, provided such report shall have been prepared, reviewed and not rejected pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.24(a).

A “Final Asset Status Report”, with respect to any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, means each related Asset Status Report, together with such other data or supporting information provided by the Special Servicer to the Subordinate Class Representative, in each case prepared in connection with the workout or liquidation of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and which, in any event, will not include any Privileged Information; provided, that no Asset Status Report shall be considered to be a Final Asset Status Report unless, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative has either finally approved of and consented to the actions proposed to be taken in connection therewith, or has exhausted all of its rights of approval or consent, or has been deemed to approve or consent to such action.
 
During any Collective Consultation Period, each of the Subordinate Class Representative and the Trust Advisor will be entitled to consult on a non-binding basis with the Special Servicer and propose possible alternative courses of action and provide other feedback in respect of any Asset Status Report, and the Special Servicer shall consider such alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the Subordinate Class Representative and/or the Trust Advisor.  The Special Servicer may revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems reasonably necessary in accordance with the Servicing Standard to take into account any input and/or recommendations of the Subordinate Class Representative and/or the Trust Advisor.  Consultation with the Trust Advisor shall occur in the manner provided in Section 3.28(f) and (h).

Loan Holder(s), as a collective whole.  Furthermore, during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative may, in general, direct the Special Servicer to take, or to refrain from taking, any actions as that representative may deem advisable with respect to the servicing and administration of Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Properties or as to which provision is otherwise made in this Agreement.  During a Subordinate Control Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, or the Subordinate Class Representative on its behalf shall have the right to remove the existing Special Servicer, with or without cause, and appoint a successor to the Special Servicer, all as provided in Section 6.05(a).

 
During any Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative shall have consultation rights (in addition to those of the Trust Advisor) with respect to Material Actions not otherwise covered by an Asset Status Report as to which the Subordinate Class Representative has been consulted.  During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder and the Subordinate Class Representative shall have no right to remove the existing Special Servicer.
 
During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the Special Servicer shall consult on a non-binding basis with the Trust Advisor with respect to Material Actions (regardless of whether such Material Action is covered by an Asset Status Report); provided, that the Special Servicer shall not consult with the Trust Advisor with respect to Material Actions related to collateral substitutions, assignments, insurance policies, borrower substitutions, lease modifications and amendments and other similar actions that the Special Servicer may perform under this Agreement to the extent such actions do not relate to the restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property.

Advisor Annual Report shall be delivered to the Certificate Administrator, and the Certificate Administrator shall promptly upon receipt post such Trust Advisor Annual Report on the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b).  The Trust Advisor shall also deliver a copy of each Trust Advisor Annual Report to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and, during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.  Each of the Special Servicer and, during any Subordinate Control Period or Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative, shall be given an opportunity to review any annual report described in this Section 3.28(a)(ii) and

(iii)          The Trust Advisor, the Trust Advisor’s subcontractors and the Trust Advisor’s Affiliates shall keep, and the Trust Advisor shall cause the Trust Advisor’s subcontractors and the Trust Advisor’s Affiliates to keep, confidential any Privileged Information received from the Special Servicer or Subordinate Class Representative in connection with the Subordinate Class Representative’s exercise of any rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, in connection with any Asset Status Report) or otherwise in connection with the Certificates.  Subject to the permitted exceptions in the following sentence, the Trust Advisor shall not disclose such Privileged Information so received from the Special Servicer or Subordinate Class Representative to any other Person (including any Certificateholders which are not then Holders of the Control-Eligible Certificates), other than to the other parties to this Agreement, to any
trustee or certificate administrator appointed for the benefit of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan and to the extent expressly required by the other provisions of this Agreement and other than under the circumstances described in the following sentence.  If the Trust Advisor, the Trust Advisor’s subcontractors or the Trust Advisor’s Affiliates, or any other party to this Agreement (other than the Special Servicer), receives any Privileged Information and has been advised that such information is Privileged Information, then such Person shall be prohibited from disclosing such information so received by it to any other Person, including in connection with preparing any responses to any investor-submitted inquiries posted on the Investor Q&A Forum, except to the extent that (a) the Special Servicer and the Subordinate Class Representative have consented in writing to its disclosure, (b) such Privileged Information becomes generally available and known to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure directly or indirectly by such Person, (c) it is reasonable and necessary for such Person to do so in working with legal counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies, (d) such Privileged Information was already known to such Person and not otherwise subject to a confidentiality obligation, (e) such disclosure is expressly authorized or required under another provision of this Agreement and/or (f) such disclosure is required by applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust Advisor shall be permitted to share Privileged Information with its Affiliates and any subcontractors of the Trust Advisor to the extent necessary and for the sole purpose of permitting the Trust Advisor to perform its duties under this Agreement and so long as such Affiliates and any such subcontractors agree in writing to be bound by the same confidentiality provisions applicable

Special Servicer shall make available Servicing Officers with relevant knowledge regarding the applicable Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and the related platform- level information for each annual meeting described in this Section 3.28.
 
(v)           If the Trust Advisor’s ability to perform its obligations in respect of the Trust Advisor Annual Report is limited or prohibited due to the failure of a party hereto to timely deliver information required to be delivered to the Trust Advisor or such information is inaccurate or incomplete, the Trust Advisor shall set forth such limitations or prohibitions in the related Trust Advisor Annual Report.
 
(b)           During a Subordinate Control Period, the Trust Advisor’s obligations shall be limited to the general reviews as set forth in this Agreement and generally will not involve an assessment of specific actions of the Special Servicer and, in any event, shall be subject to limitations described in this Agreement.
 
(c)           The Trust Advisor shall not be required, in connection with any Trust Advisor Annual Report during a Subordinate Control Period, to consider any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property with respect to which a Final Asset Status Report was not issued during the most recently ended calendar year.

to be utilized in connection with any Appraisal Reduction Amount or net present value calculations used in the Special Servicer’s determination of what course of action to take in connection with the resolution or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan prior to the utilization by the Special Servicer, and (b) insofar as the calculation and/or application of the Special Servicer under review as contemplated by clause (a) requires or depends upon the exercise of discretion by the Special Servicer, the Trust Advisor shall assess the reasonableness of the determination made by the Special Servicer in the exercise of such discretion.  The Special Servicer shall deliver the foregoing calculations, together with information and supporting materials (including such additional information reasonably requested by the Trust Advisor to confirm the mathematical accuracy of such calculations, but not
including any Privileged Information) to the Trust Advisor and (during any Collective Consultation Period) the Subordinate Class Representative.  In the event the Trust Advisor does not agree with (i) the mathematical calculations, (ii) the application of the applicable non-discretionary portions of the formula required to be utilized for such calculation or (iii) the reasonableness of any such determination made by the Special Servicer in the exercise of such discretion, the Trust Advisor and the Special Servicer shall consult in good faith with each other in order to resolve (x) any inaccuracy in the mathematical calculations or the application of the non-discretionary portions of the related formula in arriving at those mathematical calculations or (y) any disagreement over the reasonableness of a determination made by the Special Servicer in the exercise of its discretion.  During any Collective Consultation Period, the Special Servicer shall also send to the Subordinate
Class Representative copies of the Special Servicer’s calculations and the information and supporting materials, as provided above to the Trust Advisor under this subsection, and engage in consultation with the Subordinate Class Representative in connection with its calculations and determinations.  During any Collective Consultation Period, if the Trust Advisor and the Subordinate Class Representative agree on such matters, the Special Servicer shall perform its calculations in accordance with such agreement.  Otherwise, if the Trust Advisor and the Subordinate Class Representative do not reach agreement on such matters following the Trust Advisor’s calculation and verification procedures, the Special Servicer shall proceed according to its determination, and the Trust Advisor shall promptly prepare a report on the matter, which report shall set forth its and the Special Servicer’s calculations (including material differences in assumptions used therein), and deliver
such report to the Certificate Administrator, which shall post the report to the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b) and, if applicable, to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.  No other action is required in connection with such circumstances.
 
(f)            During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, the Special Servicer shall promptly deliver each Asset Status Report prepared in connection with the resolution or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan to the Trust Advisor and, during a Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative.  The Trust Advisor shall provide comments to the Special Servicer in respect of the Asset Status Reports, if any, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt, and propose possible alternative courses of action to the extent it determines such alternatives may be in the best interest of the Certificateholders (including any Certificateholders of the Control-Eligible Classes) and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, as a collective whole.
 
(g)           During any Collective Consultation Period (in addition to the Subordinate Class Representative) or Senior Consultation Period, the Trust Advisor shall consult on a non-
 


  


-265-





  


 
binding basis with the Special Servicer with respect to, and prior to, Material Actions (regardless of whether such Material Action is covered by an Asset Status Report); provided, that the Trust Advisor shall have no such duty with respect to collateral substitutions, assignments, insurance policies, borrower substitutions, lease modifications and amendments and other similar actions that the Special Servicer may perform under this Agreement to the extent such actions do not relate to the workout, restructuring, resolution, sale or liquidation of a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan or REO Property.
 
(h)           The Special Servicer shall consider such written alternative courses of action and any other feedback provided by the Trust Advisor and, during any Collective Consultation Period, the Subordinate Class Representative.  The Special Servicer shall revise the Asset Status Reports as it deems necessary to take into account such input and/or comments, to the extent the Special Servicer determines that the Trust Advisor’s and/or Subordinate Class Representative’s input and/or recommendations are consistent with the Servicing Standard and in the best interest of the Certificateholders, taking into account the interests of all of the Certificateholders (including any Certificateholders of the Control-Eligible Classes) (and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, as applicable), as a collective whole.
 
(i)            The Special Servicer shall not be required to take or to refrain from taking any action because of an objection or comment by the Trust Advisor or a recommendation of the Trust Advisor that would require or cause the Special Servicer to violate applicable law, the terms of any Mortgage Loan, any Serviced Loan Combination or any other provision of this Agreement, including the Special Servicer’s obligation to act in accordance with the Servicing Standard and the REMIC Provisions or result in an Adverse REMIC Event for any REMIC Pool or an Adverse Grantor Trust Event for the Grantor Trust Pool.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Special Servicer shall not be required to take or refrain from taking any action because of an objection or comment by the Trust Advisor or a recommendation of the Trust Advisor in any event.
 
(j)            The Trust Advisor, the Trust Advisor’s subcontractors and the Trust Advisor’s Affiliates shall keep, and the Trust Advisor shall cause the Trust Advisor’s subcontractors and the Trust Advisor’s Affiliates to keep, all Privileged Information confidential and shall not disclose such information to any other Person (including any Certificateholders which are not then included in the Control-Eligible Certificates), other than to the extent expressly set forth herein.
 
(k)           As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to receive the Trust Advisor Ongoing Fee on each Distribution Date with respect to each Serviced Mortgage Loan and any related successor REO Mortgage Loan (other than any Pari Passu Mortgage Loan or any successor REO Mortgage Loan thereto).  As to each such Serviced Mortgage Loan and related successor REO Mortgage Loan, the Trust Advisor Ongoing Fee shall accrue from time to time at the Trust Advisor Ongoing Fee Rate and shall be computed on the basis of the Stated Principal Balance of such Serviced Mortgage Loan or successor REO Mortgage Loan and in the same manner as interest is calculated thereon and for the same period respecting which any related interest payment due or deemed thereon is computed.  The Trust Advisor shall be entitled to reimbursement of any Trust Advisor Expenses provided for pursuant to Section 6.03(a),
6.03(b) and/or 6.05 hereof, such amounts to be reimbursed from amounts on

deposit in the Collection Account as provided by Section 3.05(a)(xiv), but in the case of any Trust Advisor Expenses other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses, reimbursements during any Collection Period shall not exceed the limit set forth for the related Distribution Date in Section 4.05(b) hereof.  The Trust Advisor hereby acknowledges and agrees that in no event will any Trust Advisor Expenses be payable from, and the Trust Advisor hereby waives any and all claims to, amounts distributable in respect of, the Control-Eligible Certificates; provided, that Designated Trust Advisor Expenses shall be reimbursable without limitation from the Collection Account as described in Section 3.05(a)(xiv).  Each successor Trust Advisor shall be required to acknowledge and
agree to the terms of the preceding sentence.
 
(l)            As additional compensation for its activities hereunder, the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to receive the Trust Advisor Consulting Fee.  The Trust Advisor Consulting Fee shall be payable, subject to the limitations set forth below, in an amount equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) in connection with each Material Action for which the Trust Advisor engages in consultation under Section 3.24 and this Section 3.28; provided, that (i) no such fee shall be paid except to the extent such fee is actually paid by the applicable Borrower (and in no event shall such fee be paid from the Trust Fund); (ii) the Trust Advisor shall be entitled to waive all or any portion of such fee
in its sole discretion; and (iii) the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall be authorized to waive the related Borrower’s payment of such fee in whole or in part if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, (A) determines that such waiver accords with the Servicing Standard and (B) consults with the Trust Advisor prior to effecting such waiver.  In connection with each Material Action for which the Trust Advisor has consultation rights under Section 3.24 or this Section 3.28, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to collect the applicable Trust Advisor Consulting Fee from the related Borrower, in each case, only to the extent that such collection is not prohibited
by the related Mortgage Loan Documents.  In no event shall the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, take any enforcement action in connection with the collection of such Trust Advisor Consulting Fee, except that this statement shall not be construed to prohibit requests for payment of such Trust Advisor Consulting Fee.
 
(m)          The Trust Advisor may be removed upon (i) the written direction of holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Certificates on an aggregate basis requesting a vote to replace the Trust Advisor with a replacement Trust Advisor selected by such Certificateholders (provided that the proposed replacement Trust Advisor meets the criteria set forth in Section 3.28(o)), (ii) such requesting Holders making payment to the Certificate Administrator of all reasonable fees and expenses to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with
administering such vote, (iii) such requesting Holders delivering to the Certificate Administrator a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency regarding the appointment of the replacement Trust Advisor (which confirmations will be obtained at the expense of such requesting Holders and will not constitute an Additional Trust Fund Expense) and (iv) such requesting Holders delivering to the Certificate Administrator an analogous “rating agency confirmation” from each Pari Passu Companion Rating Agency regarding the appointment of the replacement Trust Advisor (which confirmations will be obtained at the 
 


  


-267-





  


 
expense of such requesting Holders and will not constitute an Additional Trust Fund Expense).  The Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice to all Certificateholders of such request by posting such notice on the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b), and by mail, and conduct the solicitation of votes of all Certificates in such regard.  Upon the vote or written direction of Holders of at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Certificates on an aggregate basis, the Certificate
Administrator shall immediately replace the Trust Advisor with the replacement Trust Advisor.  If a proposed termination and replacement of the Trust Advisor as described above is not consummated within 180 days following the initial request of the Certificateholders who requested a vote, then the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force or effect.  In addition, during any Subordinate Control Period, the identity of any replacement Trust Advisor proposed pursuant to this Section 3.28(m) shall be subject to the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), provided that such consent will be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within ten (10) Business Days following the Subordinate Class Representative’s receipt of the request for consent, and, if granted, such consent may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn.
 
(n)           If (i) the Trust Advisor fails to duly observe or perform in any material respect any of its duties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement, (ii) an Insolvency Event occurs with respect to the Trust Advisor, or (iii) the Trust Advisor acknowledges in writing its inability to perform its duties hereunder, then either the Depositor or the Trustee may, and upon the written direction of Certificateholders representing at least 51% of the Voting Rights (taking into account the application of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts to notionally reduce the Certificate Principal Balance of the Classes of Certificates), the Trustee shall, terminate the Trust Advisor for cause.  Upon the termination of the Trust Advisor, a replacement Trust Advisor satisfying the conditions for such replacement in Section 3.28(o) below shall be selected by the Trustee.  In addition,
during any Subordinate Control Period, the identity of the proposed replacement Trust Advisor shall be subject to the consent of the Subordinate Class Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), provided that such consent will be deemed to have been granted if no objection is made within ten (10) Business Days following the Subordinate Class Representative’s receipt of the request for consent, and, if granted, such consent may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn.  The Trustee may rely on a certification by the replacement Trust Advisor that it meets such criteria.  If the Trustee is unable to find a replacement Trust Advisor within thirty (30) days of the termination of the Trust Advisor, the Depositor shall be permitted to find a replacement.  Unless and until a replacement Trust Advisor is appointed, no party shall act as the Trust Advisor and the provisions relating to consultation and consent with respect to the Trust
Advisor shall not be applicable until a replacement Trust Advisor is appointed hereunder.
 
(o)           Any replacement Trust Advisor shall (or all of the personnel responsible for supervising the obligations of the Trust Advisor shall) meet the following criteria:  (i) be regularly engaged in the business of analyzing and advising clients in commercial mortgage-backed securities matters and have at least five (5) years of experience in collateral analysis and loss projections, and (ii) have at least five (5) years of experience in commercial real estate asset

(s)            Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree, and the Certificateholders by their acceptance of their Certificates shall be deemed to have agreed, that (i) there could be multiple strategies to resolve any Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan and that the goal of the Trust Advisor’s participation is to provide monitoring (subject to, and in accordance with, the provisions of this Agreement) relating to the Special Servicer’s compliance with the Servicing Standard in making its determinations as to which strategy to execute, (ii) the Trust Advisor shall have no liability to any Certificateholder for any actions taken or for refraining from taking any actions under this Agreement, (iii) the agreements of the Trust Advisor set forth in the other provisions of this Agreement shall be construed solely as agreements to perform analytical and reporting services, (iv) the

-269-





  


 
other matter in which this Agreement contemplates consultation with the Trust Advisor shall not be construed as an approval, endorsement, acquiescence or recommendation for or against any proposed action (but, in the event of such absence of a response, the Special Servicer (x) shall be deemed to have complied with the relevant provision that otherwise required consultation with the Trust Advisor and (y) shall be entitled to proceed as if consultation with the Trust Advisor had not initially been required in connection with such Asset Status Report or other matter), (vii) any provision hereof that otherwise purports, or that may be construed, to impose on the Trust Advisor a duty to consider the Servicing Standard or the interests of the Certificateholders shall be construed as a requirement to use the Servicing Standard or such interests as the basis of measurement in its analysis and reporting and the basis of measurement in its evaluation
of the performance of the Special Servicer and its determination of whether an action, recommendation or report by the Special Servicer is in compliance with this Agreement, and not to impose on the Trust Advisor a duty to itself comply with the Servicing Standard or itself act in the interests of the Certificateholders, and such basis of measurement shall be construed to refer to no particular class of Certificates or particular Certificateholders, (viii) no other party to this Agreement, and no Subordinate Class Representative, shall have any duty to monitor or supervise the performance by the Trust Advisor of its services under this Agreement and (ix) the Trust Advisor is not an advisor within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Trust Advisor shall not owe any fiduciary duty to any Person in connection with this Agreement.
 
(t)            The Trust Advisor shall not make any principal investment in any Certificate or interest therein; provided, that such prohibition shall not be construed to have been violated (i) in connection with riskless principal transactions effected by a broker-dealer Affiliate of the Trust Advisor or (ii) pursuant to investments by an Affiliate of the Trust Advisor if the Trust Advisor and such Affiliate maintain policies and procedures designed to segregate personnel involved in the activities of the Trust Advisor under this Agreement from personnel involved in such Affiliate’s investment activities and to prevent such Affiliate and its personnel from gaining access to information regarding the Trust Fund and the Trust Advisor and its personnel from gaining access to such Affiliate’s information regarding its investment activities.
 
(u)           The Trust Advisor shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not, to enter into any transaction as a result of which (i) the Special Servicer or any Affiliate thereof would be obligated, whether by agreement or otherwise, and whether or not subject to any condition or contingency, to pay any fee to, or otherwise compensate or grant monetary or other consideration to, the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof (other than compensation to which the Trust Advisor is entitled hereunder) (x) in connection with the Trust Advisor’s obligations under this Agreement or (y) in consideration of the appointment or continuation of such Person as the Special Servicer, (ii) the Special Servicer would be entitled to receive any compensation from the Trust Advisor in connection with its activities under this Agreement or (iii) the Special Servicer would be entitled to receive from the Trust Advisor or any Affiliate thereof any
fee in connection with the appointment or continuation of such Person as Special Servicer unless, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), such transaction has been expressly approved by the Holders of Certificates representing 100% of the Voting Rights.
 
(v)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Trust Advisor shall have no duty with respect to (i) the Republic Plaza Mortgage Loan, (ii) the Republic Plaza Pari

Passu Companion Loan, (iii) the Concord Mills Mortgage Loan, (iv) the Concord Mills Pari Passu Companion Loan, and (v) any Non-Serviced Pari Passu Mortgage Loan, or the assessment of the actions of any special servicer under this Agreement or any applicable Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement taken with respect to any such mortgage loan.
 
Section 3.29     Swap Contract. (a)  On or before the Closing Date, the Certificate Administrator, not in its individual capacity but solely in its capacity as Certificate Administrator, on behalf of the Trust (for the benefit of the Holder of the Class A-FL Certificates), shall enter into the Swap Contract and related agreements with the Swap Counterparty.
 
(b)          On the Business Day prior to each P&I Advance Date, based on the reports provided by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(f), information that the Certificate Administrator obtains from the Swap Counterparty and the Swap Contract, and subject to the priorities set forth in Section 4.01(b), the Certificate Administrator shall calculate the Class A-FL Net Swap Payment and notify the Swap Counterparty in accordance with the terms of the Swap Contract.
 
(c)           No later than 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall remit the Class A-FL Net Swap Payment, if any, and the Class A-FL Percentage Interest of any Recovered Interest Amounts, Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums in respect of the Class A-FX Regular Interest, if any, to the Swap Counterparty from the Class A-FL Sub-Account in respect of the Class A-FL Certificates; provided that upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Class A-FL Distribution Conversion Event, the Certificate Administrator shall not make such payments to such Swap Counterparty.  Promptly upon receipt of any payment or other receipt from the Swap Counterparty in respect of the Swap Contract, the Certificate Administrator shall deposit the same into the Class A-FL
Sub-Account.  For the avoidance of doubt, payments by the Swap Counterparty to the Certificate Administrator and payments by the Certificate Administrator to the Swap Counterparty (including payments referenced in the first paragraph of Section 4.01(b)(iii)(A) and Section 4.01(b)(iii)(B)) pursuant to the Swap Contract with respect to any related Distribution Date (other than any Swap Termination Payments) shall be on a net basis in accordance with the terms of the Swap Contract.
 
(d)          The Certificate Administrator shall at all times enforce the Trust’s rights under the Swap Contract.  In the event of a Class A-FL Swap Default, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly provide written notice to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates and shall be required, subject to the Certificate Administrator’s determination that costs of enforcement will be recoverable from or indemnified by the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates, to take such actions (following the expiration of any applicable grace period specified in the Swap Contract), unless otherwise directed in writing by the Holders of 25% (by Certificate Principal Balance) of the Class A-FL Certificates to enforce the rights of the Trust under the Swap Contract
as may be permitted by the terms thereof and use any Swap Termination Payments received from the Swap Counterparty to enter into a replacement interest rate Swap Contract on substantially identical terms or on such other terms reasonably acceptable to the Certificate Administrator, with a replacement Swap Counterparty that would not cause a Rating Agency Trigger Event, subject, in each case, to Rating Agency Confirmation.  If the costs 
 


  


-271-





  


 
attributable to entering into a replacement interest rate Swap Contract would exceed the amount of any Swap Termination Payments, a replacement interest rate Swap Contract shall not be entered into and any such proceeds will instead be distributed to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates, pro rata, on the immediately succeeding Distribution Date.  The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to require reasonable assurances of payment (including, without limitation, reasonable indemnity therefor) from the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates prior to the incurrence of any costs in connection with the enforcement of the Swap Contract.
 
Any Class A-FL Distribution Conversion Event shall become permanent following the determination by the Certificate Administrator (subject to the direction of the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates as set forth in this Section 3.29(d)) not to enter into a replacement interest rate Swap Contract and distribution of any Swap Termination Payments to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates.  Any such Class A-FL Distribution Conversion Event (or any Class A-FL Swap Default) shall not constitute an event of default under this Agreement.
 
Upon any change (or notification to the Certificate Administrator that such change is imminent (and such change is confirmed by the Certificate Administrator)) in the payment terms on the Class A-FL Certificates, including as a result of the occurrence of a Class A-FL Distribution Conversion Event or a Class A-FL Swap Default or the cure of a Class A-FL Distribution Conversion Event or a Class A-FL Swap Default, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify DTC of the change in payment terms.
 
(e)           Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any costs and expenses related to the Swap Contract will only be payable (subsequent to the distribution of all amounts of principal and interest and reimbursement of Realized Losses and any other amounts payable with respect to the Class A-FL Certificates) from the Class A-FL Sub-Account, which in no circumstances will constitute Additional Trust Fund Expenses, and in any event in accordance with Section 4.01(b); provided, however, that any enforcement costs under this Section 3.29(e) and costs incurred in connection with any exchange of the Class A-FL Certificates to Class A-FX Certificates shall be borne by
the related Class A-FL Certificateholders from such Holder’s own funds and not from amounts allocable from any portion of the Trust to such class of Certificates.
 
(f)           The Certificate Administrator shall establish a Swap Counterparty Collateral Account, which may be a subaccount of the Distribution Account.  The Certificate Administrator shall deposit all collateral received from the Swap Counterparty under any “Credit Support Annex” (as defined in the Swap Contract) of the Swap Contract into the Swap Counterparty Collateral Account.  The only permitted withdrawal from or application of funds on deposit in, or otherwise to the credit of, a Swap Counterparty Collateral Account shall be (i) for application to obligations of the Swap Counterparty under the Swap Contract if the Swap Contract
becomes subject to a Class A-FL Swap Default in accordance with the terms of the Credit Support Annex or (ii) to return collateral to the Swap Counterparty when and as required by the Swap Contract.  The Certificate Administrator agrees to give the Swap Counterparty prompt notice if it obtains knowledge that the Swap Counterparty Collateral Account or any funds on deposit therein or otherwise to the credit of the Swap Counterparty Collateral Account, shall become subject to any writ, order, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process.  Funds credited to the Swap Counterparty Collateral Account shall be applied as

contemplated in the Swap Contract.  Subject to the terms of the Swap Contract, proceeds of the liquidation of Swap Contract collateral (if such Swap Contract becomes subject to early termination or upon default by the Swap Counterparty) shall be deposited in the Class A-FL Sub-Account for application.

(a)           In the event that any Non-Trust Trustee, the Non-Trust Master Servicer or the Non-Trust Special Servicer shall be replaced in accordance with the terms of the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall acknowledge any such successor as the successor to such Non-Trust Trustee, the Non-Trust Master Servicer or the Non-Trust Special Servicer, as the case may be, and shall, upon receiving notice of the same, notify the Trustee regarding such replacement.
 
(b)           If any of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Master Servicer receive notice from a Rating Agency that the Master Servicer is no longer an “approved” master servicer by any of the Rating Agencies rating the Certificates, then the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Master Servicer, as applicable, shall promptly notify the related Non-Trust Master Servicer of the same.

(d)           On the Republic Plaza Note A-2 Securitization Date (i) the Custodian shall, upon receipt of a Request for Release transfer the Mortgage File (other than the promissory

FX Regular Interest pursuant to Section 4.01(c) for such Distribution Date shall be deemed allocated by the Certificate Administrator to the Class A-FX Sub-Account for distribution pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(ii)(B) and (II) an amount equal to the product of (x) the Class A-FL Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and (y) any Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums allocable to the Class A-FX Regular Interest pursuant to Section 4.01(c) for such Distribution Date, shall be deemed allocated by the Certificate Administrator to the Class A-FL Sub-Account for distribution pursuant to Section 4.01(b)(iii)(B).
 
(ii)           (A)  On each Distribution Date, for so long as the Class Principal Balance of the Class A-FX Certificates has not been reduced to zero, to the extent of amounts allocated to the Class A-FX Sub-Account in accordance with this Agreement, the Certificate Administrator shall make distributions from the Class A-FX Sub-Account in the following order of priority, satisfying in full, to the extent required and possible, each priority before making any distribution with respect to any succeeding priority:
 
(I)           first, to the Holders of the Class A-FX Certificates, in respect of interest, up to an amount equal to the Interest Distribution Amount in respect of such Class for such Distribution Date;
 
(II)          second, to the Holders of the Class A-FX Certificates, in reduction of the Class Principal Balance thereof, an amount equal to the Class A-FX Principal Distribution Amount, until the outstanding Class Principal Balance of the Class A-FX Certificates has been reduced to zero;
 
(III)         third, to the Holders of the Class A-FX Certificates, until all amounts of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously allocated to the Class A-FX Certificates (as a result of the allocation of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses to the Class A-FX Regular Interest), but not previously reimbursed, have been reimbursed in full; and
 
(IV)         fourth, to the Holders of the Class A-FX Certificates, any remaining amounts in the Class A-FX Sub-Account.

case, payable to the Swap Counterparty on such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 3.29(c), the Certificate Administrator shall make distributions from the Class A-FL Sub-Account in the following order of priority, satisfying in full, to the extent required and possible, each priority before making any distribution with respect to any succeeding priority:
 
(I)           first, to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates, in respect of interest, up to an amount equal to the Interest Distribution Amount in respect of such Class for such Distribution Date;
 
(II)          second, to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates, in reduction of the Certificate Principal Balance thereof, an amount equal to the Class A-FL Principal Distribution Amount, until the outstanding Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A-FL Certificates has been reduced to zero;

(IV)         fourth, after the Class Principal Balance of the Class A-FL Certificates has been reduced to zero and all other amounts (including reimbursements of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses) have been paid to the Class A-FL Certificates, solely from amounts payable to such Class of Certificates in respect of the Class A-FL Percentage Interest of interest payments distributed on the Class A-FX Regular Interest, to the Swap Counterparty in respect of any termination payments then due to the Swap Counterparty under the Swap Contract; and
 
(V)          fifth, any remaining amount in the Class A-FL Sub-Account to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates.

(c)           Funds on deposit in the Distribution Account on each Distribution Date that represent Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges Received by the Trust with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan during the related Collection Period, in each case net of any Liquidation Fees payable therefrom, shall be distributable as follows:  if any Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium is collected during any particular Collection Period with respect to any Mortgage Loan, then on the Distribution Date corresponding to that Collection Period, the Certificate Administrator shall pay a portion of that Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium (net of Liquidation Fees payable therefrom) in the following manner:  (1) pro rata, between the (x) the group (“YM Group A”) of Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB, Class X-A and Class A-S
Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest, and (y) the group (“YM Group B” and, collectively with the YM Group A, the “YM Groups”) of Class B, Class C, Class D and Class X-B Certificates, based upon the aggregate of principal distributed to the Classes of Principal Balance Certificates in each YM Group for that Distribution Date, and (2) among the Classes of Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest in each YM Group, in the following manner, up to an amount equal to the product of (a) the Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium allocated to such YM Group, (b) the related Base Interest Fraction, and (c) a fraction, which in no event may be greater than 1.0, the numerator of which is equal to the amount of principal distributed to the holder(s) of that such Class for that Distribution Date, and the denominator of which is the total amount of principal distributed to all the Certificates or the Class A-FX
Regular Interest in that YM Group for that Distribution Date.  Any Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium allocated to such YM Group remaining after such distributions will be distributed to the Class of Class X Certificates in such YM Group.  No Prepayment Premiums or Yield Maintenance Charges will be distributed to the Holders of the Class E, Class F, Class G or Class R Certificates.  The Holders of the Class X-B Certificates will be entitled to all Prepayment Premiums and Yield Maintenance Charges collected after the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-SB, Class X-A, Class A-S, Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest are retired.  Any funds distributed on any such Class of Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest in respect of any Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge pursuant to this Section 4.01(c) shall constitute an “Additional Yield Amount”
for such Class.
 
Any distributions of Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment Premiums in respect of the Class A-FX Regular Interest shall be distributed to the Holders of the Class A-FX Certificates as specified in Section 4.01(b)(ii)(B) and to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates or to the Swap Counterparty as specified in Section 4.01(b)(iii)(B).
 
For purposes of the immediately preceding paragraph, the relevant “Base Interest Fraction” in connection with any Principal Prepayment of any Mortgage Loan that provides for the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge or Prepayment Premium, and with respect to any Class of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates) and the Class A-FX Regular Interest, shall be a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the greater of (x) zero and (y) the difference between (i) the Pass-Through Rate on such Class or the Class A-FX Regular Interest, as applicable, for the related Distribution Date, and (ii) the applicable Discount Rate and (B) the denominator of which is the difference between (i) the Mortgage Rate on such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the applicable Discount Rate; provided, that:  (a) under no circumstances will the Base Interest Fraction be greater
than 1.0; (b) if the applicable Discount Rate is greater than or equal to the Mortgage Rate on such Mortgage Loan and is greater than or 
 


  


-282-





  


 
equal to the Pass-Through Rate on such Class for the related Distribution Date, then the Base Interest Fraction will equal zero; and (c) if the applicable Discount Rate is greater than or equal to the Mortgage Rate on such Mortgage Loan and is less than the Pass-Through Rate on such Class for the related Distribution Date, then the Base Interest Fraction shall be equal to 1.0.  If a Mortgage Loan provides for a step-up in the Mortgage Rate, then the Mortgage Rate used in the determination of the Base Interest Fraction will be the Mortgage Rate in effect at the time of the prepayment.
 
For purposes of the preceding paragraph, the relevant “Discount Rate” in connection with any Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge collected on any prepaid Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan and distributable on any Distribution Date shall be a rate per annum equal to (i) if a discount rate was used in the calculation of the applicable Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge pursuant to the terms of the relevant Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, such discount rate (as reported by the Master Servicer), converted (if necessary) to a monthly equivalent yield, or (ii) if a discount rate was not used in the calculation of the applicable Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge pursuant to the terms of the relevant Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, the yield calculated by the linear interpolation of the yields (as reported
under the heading “U.S. Government Securities/Treasury Constant Maturities” in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) published by the Federal Reserve Board for the week most recently ended before the date of the relevant prepayment (or deemed prepayment) of U.S. Treasury constant maturities with a maturity date, one longer and one shorter, most nearly approximating the related Stated Maturity Date (in the case of a Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan that is not related to an ARD Mortgage Loan) or the related Anticipated Repayment Date (in the case of a Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan that is related to an ARD Mortgage Loan), such interpolated yield converted to a monthly equivalent yield.  If Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) is no longer published, the Certificate Administrator shall select a comparable publication as the source of the applicable yields of U.S. Treasury constant maturities.
 
(d)           On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Distribution Account any amounts then on deposit in the Class V Sub-Account of the Distribution Account that represent Post-ARD Additional Interest collected or deemed collected in respect of the Mortgage Loans or REO Mortgage Loans related to ARD Mortgage Loans during the related Collection Period and shall distribute such amounts to the Holders of the Class V Certificates.
 
(e)           All distributions made with respect to each Class of Certificates on each Distribution Date shall be allocated pro rata among the outstanding Certificates in such Class based on their respective Percentage Interests.  Except as otherwise provided below, all such distributions with respect to each Class of Certificates on each Distribution Date shall be made to the Certificateholders of the respective Class of record at the close of business on the related Record Date and shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of any such Certificateholder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such Certificateholder shall have provided the Certificate Administrator with wiring instructions no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the related Record Date (which wiring instructions may be in the form of
a standing order applicable to all subsequent Distribution Dates), or otherwise

by check mailed to the address of such Certificateholder as it appears in the Certificate Register.  The final distribution on each Certificate (determined, in the case of a Principal Balance Certificate, without regard to any possible future reimbursement of any Realized Loss or Additional Trust Fund Expense previously allocated to such Certificate pursuant to Section 4.04(a)) will be made in a like manner, but only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the offices of the Certificate Registrar or such other location specified in the notice to Certificateholders of such final distribution.  Prior to any termination of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 9.01, any distribution that is to be made with respect to a Certificate
in reimbursement of a Realized Loss or Additional Trust Fund Expense previously allocated thereto, which reimbursement is to occur after the date on which such Certificate is surrendered as contemplated by the preceding sentence, will be made by check mailed to the address of the Certificateholder that surrendered such Certificate as such address last appeared in the Certificate Register or to any other address of which the Certificate Administrator was subsequently notified in writing.  If such check is returned to the Certificate Administrator, then the Certificate Administrator, directly or through an agent, shall take such reasonable steps to contact the related Holder and deliver such check as it shall deem appropriate.  Any funds in respect of a check returned to the Certificate Administrator shall be set aside by the Certificate Administrator and held uninvested in trust and credited to the account of the appropriate Holder.  The costs and expenses of locating
the appropriate Holder and holding such funds shall be paid out of such funds.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any former Holder on any amount held in trust hereunder.  If the Certificate Administrator has not, after having taken such reasonable steps, located the related Holder by the second anniversary of the initial sending of a check, the Certificate Administrator shall, subject to applicable law, distribute the unclaimed funds to the Class R Certificateholders.
 
(f)            Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate shall be paid to the Depository, as Holder thereof, and the Depository shall be responsible for crediting the amount of such distribution to the accounts of its Depository Participants in accordance with its normal procedures.  Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such distribution to the related Certificate Owners that it represents and to each indirect participating brokerage firm for which it acts as agent.  Each indirect participating brokerage firm shall be responsible for disbursing funds to the related Certificate Owners that it represents.  None of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Certificate Registrar, the Depositor, the Special Servicer or the Master Servicer shall have any responsibility therefor except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or applicable law.  The Certificate Administrator and the
Depositor shall perform their respective obligations under each of the letter of representations among the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator and the initial Depository dated as of the Closing Date and pertaining to the Book-Entry Certificates, a copy of which Letters of Representation are attached hereto as Exhibit B.
 
(g)           The rights of the Certificateholders to receive distributions from the proceeds of the Trust Fund with respect to the Certificates, and all rights and interests of the Certificateholders in and to such distributions, shall be as set forth in this Agreement.  Neither the Holders of any Class of Certificates nor any party hereto shall in any way be responsible or liable to the Holders of any other Class of Certificates with respect to amounts properly previously distributed on the Certificates.
 


  


-284-





  


 
(h)           Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.01, whenever the Certificate Administrator receives written notification of or expects that the final distribution with respect to any Class of Certificates (determined, in the case of a Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest, without regard to any possible future reimbursement of any Realized Loss or Additional Trust Fund Expense previously allocated to such Class of Certificates pursuant to Section 4.04(a)) will be made on the next Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall, no later than the second Business Day prior to such Distribution Date, mail to each Holder of record of such Class of Certificates on such date (with
a copy to be posted to the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b)) a notice to the effect that:
 
(i)            the Certificate Administrator expects that the final distribution with respect to such Class of Certificates will be made on such Distribution Date but only upon presentation and surrender of such Certificates at the office of the Certificate Registrar or at such other location therein specified, and
 
(ii)           no interest shall accrue on such Certificates from and after the end of the Interest Accrual Period for such Distribution Date.
 
Any funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of Certificates of such Class on such Distribution Date because of the failure of such Holder or Holders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held uninvested in trust and credited to the account or accounts of the appropriate non-tendering Holder or Holders.  If any Certificates as to which notice has been given pursuant to this Section 4.01(h) shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six (6) months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice all such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation,
then the Certificate Administrator, directly or through an agent, shall take such steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning the surrender of their Certificates as it shall deem appropriate.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such non-tendering Certificateholders following the first anniversary of the delivery of such second notice thereto shall be paid out of such funds.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any former Holder on any amount held in trust pursuant to this paragraph.  If all of the Certificates as to which notice has been given pursuant to this Section 4.01(h) shall not have been surrendered for cancellation by the second anniversary of the delivery of the second notice, the Certificate Administrator shall, subject to applicable law, distribute to the Class R Certificateholders all unclaimed funds and other assets which remain subject
thereto.
 
(i)            All distributions made in respect of each Class of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates) and the Class A-FX Regular Interest on each Distribution Date (including the Final Distribution Date) pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c) shall be deemed to have first been distributed from REMIC II to REMIC III with respect to the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest(s) for such Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest; and all distributions made with respect to each Class of Interest Only Certificates on each Distribution Date pursuant to 
 


  


-285-





  


 
Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c), and allocable to any particular REMIC III Component of such Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest, shall be deemed to have first been distributed from REMIC II to REMIC III in respect of the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest for such REMIC III Component.  In each case, if such distribution on any such Class of Certificates was a distribution of accrued interest, of principal, of additional interest (in the form of one or more Additional Yield Amounts) or in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously allocated to such Class of Principal Balance Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest, then the corresponding distribution deemed to be made on a REMIC II Regular Interest pursuant to the preceding sentence (and, if applicable the next
paragraph) shall be deemed to also be, respectively, a distribution of accrued interest, of principal, of additional interest (in the form of one or more Additional Yield Amounts) or in reimbursement of any Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses previously allocated to REMIC III in respect of such REMIC II Regular Interest.
 
The actual distributions made by the Certificate Administrator on each Distribution Date in respect of the Regular Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c), as applicable, shall be deemed to have been so made from the amounts deemed distributed with respect to the REMIC II Regular Interests on such Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 4.01(i).  Notwithstanding the deemed distributions on the REMIC II Regular Interests described in this Section 4.01(i), actual distributions of funds from the REMIC Sub-Account of the Distribution Account shall be made only in accordance with Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c),
as applicable.
 
(j)           On each Distribution Date, including the Final Distribution Date, the Available Distribution Amount for such date shall be deemed to have first been distributed from REMIC I to REMIC II in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interests, in each case to the extent of the remaining portions of such funds, for the following purposes and in the following order of priority:
 
(i)            as deemed distributions of interest with respect to all the REMIC I Regular Interests, up to an amount equal to, and pro rata in accordance with, all Uncertificated Distributable Interest with respect to each REMIC I Regular Interest for such Distribution Date and, to the extent not previously deemed distributed, for all prior Distribution Dates;
 
(ii)           as deemed distributions of principal with respect to all the REMIC I Regular Interests, up to an amount equal to, and pro rata in accordance with, as to each REMIC I Regular Interest, the portion of the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date attributable to the related Mortgage Loan(s) or REO Mortgage Loan(s); and
 
(iii)          as deemed distributions with respect to all the REMIC I Regular Interests, up to an amount equal to, pro rata in accordance with, and in reimbursement of, any Realized Losses, Additional Trust Fund Expenses and Trust Advisor Expenses previously allocated to each REMIC I Regular Interest (with compounded interest).
 
The portion of each Prepayment Premium and Yield Maintenance Charge that is distributed to any Class of Regular Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest on any

Distribution Date shall, in each case, be deemed to have been distributed from REMIC I to REMIC II in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interest(s) corresponding to the prepaid Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, in respect of which such Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge was received or deemed received.
 
The actual distributions made by the Certificate Administrator on each Distribution Date in respect of the Regular Certificates or the Class A-FX Regular Interest pursuant to Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c), as applicable, shall be deemed to have been so made from the amounts deemed distributed with respect to the REMIC I Regular Interests on such Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 4.01(j).  Notwithstanding the deemed distributions on the REMIC I Regular Interests described in this Section 4.01(j), actual distributions of funds from the REMIC Sub-Account of the Distribution Account shall be made only in accordance with Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(c),
as applicable.

The Certificate Administrator shall have no obligation to provide the information or reports described in this Section 4.02(a) until it has received the requisite information or reports from the Master Servicer provided for herein, and the Certificate Administrator shall not be in default hereunder due to a delay in providing such information and reports caused by the failure of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer to timely deliver any information or reports hereunder.  None of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator shall be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any information supplied to it by a Borrower, each other or a third party, and accepted by it in good faith, that is included in any reports, statements, materials or information prepared or provided by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the
Certificate Administrator, as applicable. None of the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall have any obligation to verify the accuracy or completeness of any information provided by a Borrower, a third party or each other.
 
During any period that reports are required to be filed with the Commission with respect to the Trust pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, each recipient of information regarding the Trust on the Certificate Administrator’s Website will be deemed to have agreed to keep confidential such information until such reports are filed with the Commission, and to the extent such information is presented on the Certificate Administrator’s Website, such website will bear a legend to the following effect:  “No recipient shall use or disclose the information contained in this statement/report/file in any manner which could result

The Certificate Administrator makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of any report, document or other information made available on the Certificate Administrator’s Website and assumes no responsibility therefor.  In addition, the Certificate Administrator may disclaim responsibility for any information distributed by the Certificate Administrator for which it is not the original source.

The Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to rely on but shall not be responsible for the content or accuracy of any information provided by third parties for purposes of preparing the Distribution Date Statement and may affix thereto any disclaimer it deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion (without suggesting liability on the part of any other party hereto).
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless specifically provided for herein, in no event shall any provision of this Agreement be construed to require the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator to produce any ad hoc or non-standard written reports (in addition to the CREFC reports, inspection reports and other specific periodic reports otherwise required).  If the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Certificate Administrator elects to provide any ad hoc or non-standard reports, it may require the Person requesting such report to pay a reasonable fee to cover the costs of the preparation thereof.
 
(b)           Certain Tax-Related Reporting to Certificateholders by the Certificate Administrator.  Within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the Certificate Administrator shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and mail to each Person who at any time during the calendar year was a Certificateholder (i) a statement containing the aggregate information set forth in items 3, 4 and 14 of Exhibit G-2 hereto for such calendar year or applicable portion thereof during which such person was a Certificateholder and (ii) such other customary information as the Certificate Administrator deems necessary or desirable for Certificateholders to prepare their federal, state and local income tax returns, including the amount of original issue discount accrued on the Certificates, if applicable.  The obligations of the Certificate Administrator in the immediately

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the CREFC Loan Periodic Update File required to be delivered by the Master Servicer in January 2013 will be based solely upon information generated from actual collections received by the Master Servicer or that are remitted to the Master Servicer from the Non-Trust Master Servicer and from information that the respective Mortgage Loan Sellers deliver or cause to be delivered to the Master Servicer (including but not limited to information prepared by third-party servicers of the subject Mortgage Loans with respect to the period prior to the Closing Date).  The Special Servicer shall from time to time (and, in any event, upon request) provide the Master Servicer with such information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and Administered REO Properties as may be reasonably necessary for the Master Servicer to prepare each report and any supplemental

Class Representative as complete a report as the information provided by the Special Servicer or such party under a Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as the case may be) permits and shall promptly update and provide to the Certificate Administrator and the Subordinate Class Representative a complete report when the Special Servicer or such party under a Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement (as the case may be) provides the Master Servicer with the requisite missing information; and the Master Servicer shall not be in breach hereunder for so providing an incomplete report under Section 4.02(c), Section 4.02(d) or Section 4.02(f) under the foregoing circumstances.  Furthermore, if any report to be provided to the Certificate Administrator and/or the Subordinate Class Representative by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(c),

(i)            the amount of the distributions made on the respective interests in such Serviced Loan Combination for such period allocable to interest (separately identifying Default Interest) and the amount thereof allocable to principal;

Section 4.03     P&I Advances.
 
(a)           On or before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on each P&I Advance Date, the Master Servicer shall, subject to Section 4.03(c), either (i) remit from its own funds to the Certificate Administrator for deposit into the Distribution Account an amount equal to the 
 


  


-295-





  


 
aggregate amount of P&I Advances, if any, to be made by the Master Servicer in respect of the related Distribution Date, (ii) apply amounts held in the Collection Account for future distribution to Certificateholders in subsequent months in discharge of any such obligation to make such P&I Advances, or (iii) make such P&I Advances in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii) aggregating the total amount of P&I Advances to be made by the Master Servicer.  Any amounts held in the Collection Account for future distribution and so used to make P&I Advances shall be appropriately reflected in the Master Servicer’s records and replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account prior to the next succeeding Master Servicer Remittance Date (to the extent not previously replaced through the deposit of Late Collections of the delinquent principal and interest in respect of which such P&I
Advances were made).  If, as of 3:30 p.m. (New York City time) on any P&I Advance Date, the Master Servicer shall not have made any P&I Advance required to be made by it on such date pursuant to this Section 4.03(a) (and shall not have delivered to the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee the Officer’s Certificate and other documentation related to a determination of nonrecoverability of a P&I Advance pursuant to Section 4.03(c)) or shall not have remitted any portion of the Master Servicer Remittance Amount required to be remitted by the Master Servicer on such date, then the Certificate Administrator shall provide notice of such failure to the Master Servicer by facsimile transmission (at facsimile number:  (704) 715-0034) and by telephone (at (800)
326-1334) as soon as possible, but in any event before 4:30 p.m. (New York City time) on such P&I Advance Date.  If after such notice the Certificate Administrator does not receive the full amount of such P&I Advances by 9:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the related Distribution Date, then the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Trustee (but in any event before 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) and the Trustee shall (not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the related Distribution Date) make the portion of such P&I Advances that was required to be, but was not, made or remitted, as the case may be, by the Master Servicer with respect to the related Distribution Date.
 
With respect to any Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer or Trustee, as applicable, shall provide the Other Master Servicer and the Other Trustee under the Other Securitization with written notice of any P&I Advance relating to such Mortgage Loan within two (2) Business Days of making such P&I Advance.
 
(b)          The aggregate amount of P&I Advances to be made by the Master Servicer (or by the Trustee, if the Master Servicer fails to do so) in respect of any Distribution Date, subject to Section 4.03(c) below, shall equal the aggregate of all Monthly Payments (other than Balloon Payments) and any Assumed Monthly Payments, in each case net of any related Master Servicing Fees (and, in the case of a Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan that is a successor thereto, the Non-Trust Primary Servicing Fee and Non-Trust Trust Advisor fee payable under the related Non-Trust Pooling and Servicing Agreement), due or deemed due and net of any Post-ARD Additional Interest, as the case may be, in respect of the Mortgage Loans and any successor REO Mortgage Loans with respect thereto on their respective Due Dates occurring in the month in which such
Distribution Date occurs, in each case to the extent such amount was not Received by the Trust as of the close of business on the related Determination Date; provided that, if an Appraisal Reduction Amount exists with respect to any Required Appraisal Loan, then the interest portion of any P&I Advance required to be made in respect of such Required Appraisal Loan for the related Distribution Date shall be reduced (it being herein acknowledged that there shall be no reduction in the principal portion of such P&I 
 


  


-296-





  


 
Advance) to equal the product of (i) the amount of the interest portion of such P&I Advance that would otherwise be required to be made in respect of such Required Appraisal Loan for such Distribution Date without regard to this proviso, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which shall equal the Stated Principal Balance of such Required Appraisal Loan immediately prior to such Distribution Date, net of the related Appraisal Reduction Amount, and the denominator of which shall equal the Stated Principal Balance of such Required Appraisal Loan immediately prior to such Distribution Date.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no P&I Advance shall be required to be made hereunder if such P&I Advance would, if made, constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance.  The determination by the Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) that a prior P&I Advance (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) that it has made constitutes a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, shall be made by such Person in its reasonable, good faith judgment.  In making such recoverability determination, such Person will be entitled to consider (among other things) the obligations of the Borrower under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan as it may have been modified, to consider (among other things) the related Mortgaged Properties in their “as is” or then current conditions and occupancies, as
modified by such party’s assumptions regarding the possibility and effects of future adverse change with respect to such Mortgaged Properties, to estimate and consider (among other things) future expenses and to estimate and consider (among other things) the timing of recoveries.  In addition, any such Person may update or change its recoverability determinations at any time and may obtain from the Special Servicer any analysis, Appraisals or market value estimates or other information in the possession of the Special Servicer for such purposes.  Any determination by the Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) that it has made a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, shall be evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Depositor, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and, if made by the Master Servicer, the
Trustee (on or before the related P&I Advance Date in the case of a proposed P&I Advance), setting forth the basis for such determination, accompanied by a copy of an Appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property or REO Property performed within the nine (9) months preceding such determination by a Qualified Appraiser, and further accompanied by any other information, including engineers’ reports, environmental surveys or similar reports, that the Person making such determination may have obtained.  A copy of any such Officer’s Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Trustee shall also be promptly delivered to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, the Special Servicer and the Master Servicer for the subject Mortgage Loan.  Absent bad faith, the Master Servicer’s determination as to the recoverability of any P&I Advance shall be conclusive and binding on the Certificateholders
and, in all cases, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any nonrecoverability determination made by the Master Servicer with respect to a particular P&I Advance.  The Special Servicer shall promptly furnish any party required to make P&I Advances hereunder with any information in its possession regarding the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans and REO Properties as such party required to make P&I Advances may reasonably request.  The Master Servicer shall consider Unliquidated Advances in respect of prior P&I Advances as outstanding Advances for purposes of recoverability determinations as if such Unliquidated Advance were a P&I Advance.
 


  


-297-





  


 
The Special Servicer for each Mortgage Loan shall also be entitled to make a determination (subject to the same standards and procedures that apply in connection with a determination by the Master Servicer) to the effect that a prior P&I Advance (or Unliquidated Advance in respect thereof) previously made hereunder by the Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee) constitutes a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance by the Master Servicer (or, if applicable, the Trustee), if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance, in which case such P&I Advance shall constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance for all purposes of this Agreement.  A copy of any Officer’s Certificate (and accompanying information) of the Special Servicer in support of its determination shall be promptly delivered to the Master Servicer for the subject Mortgage Loan.  The Special Servicer may update
or change its recoverability determination at any time.
 
(d)           In the case of each Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer and the Trustee shall each be entitled to receive interest at the Reimbursement Rate in effect from time to time, accrued on the amount of each P&I Advance made thereby (with its own funds), to the extent that such P&I Advance (i) relates to a Monthly Payment or Assumed Monthly Payment in respect of a Mortgage Loan that is a Past Grace Period Loan or an REO Mortgage Loan when made, in which case such interest shall begin to accrue from the related P&I Advance Date, or (ii) is made with respect to a Within Grace Period Loan and remains outstanding when the subject Mortgage Loan becomes a Past Grace Period Loan in respect of the subject Monthly Payment or Assumed Monthly Payment, in which case such interest shall begin to accrue when the subject Mortgage Loan becomes a Past Grace Period Loan in respect of the subject
Monthly Payment or Assumed Monthly Payment, in either case, for so long as such P&I Advance is outstanding (or, in the case of Advance Interest payable to the Master Servicer, if earlier, until the Late Collection of the delinquent principal and/or interest in respect of which such P&I Advance was made has been Received by the Trust).  Such interest with respect to any P&I Advance shall be payable:  (i) first, in accordance with Sections 3.05 and 3.25, out of any Default Charges subsequently collected on the particular Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan as to which such P&I Advance relates; and (ii) then, after such P&I Advance is reimbursed, but only if and to the extent that such Default Charges are insufficient to cover such Advance Interest, out of general collections on the Mortgage
Loans and REO Properties on deposit in the Collection Account.  The Master Servicer shall (subject to the operation of Section 3.05(a)(II)) reimburse itself or the Trustee, as applicable, for any outstanding P&I Advance made thereby with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan as soon as practicable after funds available for such purpose are deposited in the Collection Account, and in no event shall interest accrue in accordance with this Section 4.03(d) on any P&I Advance as to which the corresponding Late Collection was received by or on behalf of the Trust as of the related P&I Advance Date.
 
(e)           With respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, the Master Servicer will be permitted to make its determination that it has made a P&I Advance on the related Mortgage Loan that is a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance or that any proposed P&I Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance with respect to such Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 4.03(a) independently of any determination made in respect of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, by the related Other Master Servicer.  If the Master Servicer determines that a proposed P&I Advance with respect to such Serviced Loan Combination, if made, or any outstanding P&I Advance with respect to any such Mortgage Loan previously 
 


  


-298-





  


 
made, would be, or is, as applicable, a Nonrecoverable Advance or if the Master Servicer subsequently determines that a proposed Servicing Advance would be a Nonrecoverable Advance or an outstanding Servicing Advance is or would be a Nonrecoverable Advance, the Master Servicer shall promptly provide the related Other Master Servicer written notice of such determination.  If the Master Servicer receives written notice from any related Other Master Servicer that such Other Master Servicer has determined, with respect to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, that any proposed advance of principal and/or interest with respect to such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan would be, or any outstanding advance of principal and interest is, a nonrecoverable advance of principal and/or interest, such determination shall not be binding on the Certificateholders, the Master Servicer or the Trustee but each of the Master Servicer
and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such nonrecoverability determination.
 
In connection with any Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan, any determination by the Master Servicer that any P&I Advance made or to be made with respect to such Non-Trust-Serviced Pooled Mortgage Loan (or any successor REO Mortgage Loan with respect thereto) is or, if made, would be a Nonrecoverable P&I Advance may be made independently from any determinations (or the absence of any determinations) made by the related Non-Trust Master Servicer regarding nonrecoverability of debt service advances on the related Non-Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
(f)            With regard to such P&I Advances, the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall account for that part of the P&I Advances which is attributable to Past Grace Period Loans, and that part of the P&I Advances which is attributable to Within Grace Period Loans.
 
(g)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no P&I Advances shall be made with respect to any Pari Passu Companion Loan (whether or not it constitutes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan or otherwise) or any successor REO Mortgage Loan related thereto.
 
(h)           Neither the Master Servicer nor the Trustee shall advance any amount due to be paid by the Swap Counterparty for distribution to the Class A-FL Certificates.
 
Section 4.04     Allocation of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.
 
(a)           On each Distribution Date, following the distributions to Certificateholders to be made on such date pursuant to Section 4.01, the Certificate Administrator shall determine the amount, if any, by which (i) the then aggregate of the Class Principal Balances of all the Classes of Principal Balance Certificates (other than the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates) and the Class A-FX Regular Interest, exceeds (ii) the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date.  If such excess does exist, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portions of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool
pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during any prior Collection Period (other than those that were determined to constitute Nonrecoverable Advances in the immediately preceding Collection Period), the Class Principal Balances of the Class G, Class F,

Class E, Class D, Class C, Class B and Class A-S Certificates shall be reduced sequentially, in that order, in each case, until such excess or the related Class Principal Balance is reduced to zero (whichever occurs first).  If, after the foregoing reductions, the amount described in clause (i) of the second preceding sentence still exceeds the amount described in clause (ii) of such sentence, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during any prior Collection Period (other than those that were determined to constitute Nonrecoverable Advances in the immediately
preceding Collection Period), the respective Class Principal Balances of all the outstanding Classes of the Class A Certificates (other than the Class A-FL, Class A-FX and Class A-S Certificates) and the Class A-FX Regular Interest shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in accordance with the relative sizes of such Class Principal Balances, until any such remaining excess is reduced to zero.  All reductions in the Class Principal Balances of the respective Classes of the Principal Balance Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest under this subsection (a) shall constitute allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.  Any reduction in the Class Principal Balance of the Class A-FX Regular Interest for any Distribution Date pursuant to this Section 4.04(a) shall be allocated between the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates in accordance with the Class A-FX Percentage Interest
for such Distribution Date and the Class A-FL Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively.
 
(b)           On each Distribution Date, following the deemed distributions to be made in respect of the REMIC II Regular Interests on such date pursuant to Section 4.01(g), the Certificate Administrator shall determine the amount, if any, by which (i) the then aggregate Uncertificated Principal Balance of the REMIC II Regular Interests, exceeds (ii) the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Pool that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date.  If such excess does exist, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a))
during the preceding Collection Period, the Uncertificated Principal Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest G, REMIC II Regular Interest F, REMIC II Regular Interest E, REMIC II Regular Interest D, REMIC II Regular Interest C, REMIC II Regular Interest B and REMIC II Regular Interest A-S shall be reduced sequentially, in that order, in each case, until such excess (other than any portion thereof that exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period) or the related Uncertificated Principal Balance is reduced to zero (whichever occurs first).  If, after the foregoing reductions, the amount described in clause (i) of the second preceding sentence
still exceeds the amount described in clause (ii) of such sentence, then, except to the extent that such excess exists because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period, the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the REMIC II Regular Interest that are the Corresponding REMIC II Regular Interest with respect to the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest shall be reduced on a pro rata basis, as among such individual Corresponding REMIC II

Regular Interests, in accordance with their Uncertificated Principal Balances, until any such remaining excess is reduced to zero.  All reductions in the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the respective REMIC II Regular Interests under this subsection (b) shall be deemed to constitute allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.
 
(c)           On each Distribution Date, if, following the deemed distributions to be made in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interests pursuant to Section 4.01(j), the Uncertificated Principal Balance of any REMIC I Regular Interest, in each case after taking account of such deemed distributions, exceeds the Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan (or, if such REMIC I Regular Interest relates to multiple Replacement Mortgage Loans, the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans and/or REO Mortgage Loans), as the case may be, that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date, then, except to the extent that such excess exists (taking account of the provisions of the next succeeding sentence) because of the reimbursement of Workout-Delayed Reimbursement Amounts (from the principal portion
of P&I Advances and/or payments or other collections of principal on the Mortgage Pool pursuant to subsection (II)(iii) of Section 3.05(a)) during the preceding Collection Period, the Uncertificated Principal Balance of such REMIC I Regular Interest shall be reduced to equal such Stated Principal Balance of such related Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan (or, if such REMIC I Regular Interest relates to multiple Replacement Mortgage Loans, the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loans and/or REO Mortgage Loans), as the case may be, that will be outstanding immediately following such Distribution Date.  For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the aggregate amount excluded from the aggregate reductions of the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the REMIC I Regular Interests collectively shall equal the amount excluded from the reductions of the Uncertificated Principal
Balances of the REMIC II Regular Interests pursuant to subsection (b) and such aggregate exclusion amount shall be deemed to be allocated among the REMIC I Regular Interests pro rata according to their Stated Principal Balances that, in the absence of such any and all such exclusions, would have been outstanding immediately after such Distribution Date by operation of the immediately preceding sentence.  Any reductions in the Uncertificated Principal Balances of the respective REMIC I Regular Interests under this subsection (c) shall be deemed to constitute allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses.
 
Section 4.05     Allocation of Certain Trust Advisor Expenses.
 
(a)           On each Distribution Date, immediately prior to the distributions to be made to the Regular Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest for such Distribution Date pursuant to Section 4.01(a), the Certificate Administrator shall allocate Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) to reduce the Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest for such Distribution Date for the Class D, Class C and Class B Certificates, in that order, in each case, until the Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest of such Class for such Distribution Date has been reduced to zero.  Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall not be allocated to reduce interest distributable on the Class A Certificates, the Class A-FX Regular Interest, the Class X Certificates or the Control-Eligible Certificates or the
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.

To the extent that the amount of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) payable with respect to any Distribution Date is greater than the aggregate amount of Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest otherwise distributable to the Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates for such Distribution Date, the resulting Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall be allocated to reduce the Principal Distribution Amount otherwise allocable to the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control-Eligible Certificates for such Distribution Date.  Such Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall reduce the Principal Distribution Amount for the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control-Eligible Certificates for such Distribution Date, and shall be allocated to reduce the Certificate Principal Balances of such Certificates
in the following order:  to the Class D, Class C, Class B and Class A-S Certificates, in each case, until the remaining Certificate Principal Balance of such Class of Certificates has been reduced to zero.  Following the reduction of the Certificate Principal Balances of the foregoing Classes of Principal Balance Certificates to zero, the Certificate Administrator shall allocate any remaining Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) among the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest, pro rata (based upon their respective Certificate Principal Balances), until the remaining Certificate Principal Balances of the Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3 and Class A-SB Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest have been reduced to zero.  Any Excess Trust Advisor Expenses allocated to the Class A-FX Regular Interest for any Distribution Date pursuant to this Section
4.05(a) shall be allocated between the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates in accordance with the Class A-FX Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date and the Class A-FL Percentage Interest for such Distribution Date, respectively.
 
Any Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) or Excess Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) allocated to a Class of Certificates (which are not Control-Eligible Certificates) shall be allocated among the respective Certificates of such Class in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced by the respective Certificates.  If amounts distributable in respect of the Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest to the Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates and otherwise available as the indicated portion of the Principal Distribution Amount are insufficient to reimburse any related Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) on a Distribution Date, any unreimbursed Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall remain unreimbursed until the next Distribution Date that such applicable amounts are available.  In
no event shall any Trust Advisor Expenses other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses reduce or delay any principal or interest payable in respect of the Control-Eligible Certificates.
 
(b)           On any Distribution Date, the amount reimbursable to the Trust Advisor in respect of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) for such Distribution Date shall not exceed the sum of (i) the portion of the Principal Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date otherwise distributable to the Principal Balance Certificates that are not Control-Eligible Certificates and (ii) the aggregate amount of Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest (for such purposes, calculated without regard to any reductions pursuant to clause (iv) of the definition of Unadjusted Distributable Certificate Interest as a result of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) for such Distribution Date) that would otherwise be distributable to the Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates for such

Distribution Date. Any amount of Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) that are not reimbursed on a Distribution Date shall be payable on the next Distribution Date to the extent funds are sufficient, in accordance with Section 4.05(a), to make such payments.
 
(c)           To the extent that any actual recoveries of previously-incurred Trust Advisor Expenses (other than Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) are received from a source other than the proceeds of the related Mortgage Loan during the Collection Period related to any Distribution Date, such amounts shall be applied, first, as provided in Section 4.01(a) to reimburse the Holders of any Regular Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest (and therefore the Class A-FX and Class A-FL Certificates) that suffered write-offs in connection with Trust Advisor Expenses, and any portion of such recovery remaining after such application shall be considered in the calculation of the Interest Distribution Amounts of the Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates, as and to the extent set forth in the definition of Interest Distribution Amount,
for such Distribution Date (with the actual payment of such portion to be made to the Holders of the Class B, Class C and/or Class D Certificates to the extent required under the combined operation of the definition of Interest Distribution Amount and the provisions of Section 4.01(a) other than the final paragraph of Section 4.01(a)).
 
Section 4.06     Calculations.
 
Provided that the Certificate Administrator receives the necessary information from the Master Servicer and/or the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator shall be responsible for performing all calculations necessary in connection with the actual and deemed distributions to be made pursuant to Section 4.01, the preparation of the Distribution Date Statements pursuant to Section 4.02(a) and the actual and deemed allocations of Realized Losses and Additional Trust Fund Expenses to be made pursuant to Section 4.04 and the actual and deemed allocations of Trust Advisor Expenses to be made pursuant to Section 4.05.  The Certificate Administrator shall calculate
the Available Distribution Amount for each Distribution Date and shall allocate such amount among Certificateholders in accordance with this Agreement.  Absent actual knowledge of an error therein, the Certificate Administrator shall have no obligation to recompute, recalculate or otherwise verify any information provided to it by the Master Servicer.  The calculations by the Certificate Administrator contemplated by this Section 4.06 shall, in the absence of manifest error, be presumptively deemed to be correct for all purposes hereunder.

(b)           No Transfer of any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein shall be made unless that Transfer is exempt from the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable securities or blue sky laws of any state or other jurisdiction within the United States, its territories and possessions, or is otherwise made in accordance with the Securities Act and such other securities or blue sky laws.  If offers and sales of any Certificate are made in any jurisdiction outside of the United States, its territories and possessions, the Person making such offers and sales must comply with all applicable laws of such jurisdiction.
 
If a Transfer of any Definitive Non-Registered Certificate is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Non-Registered Certificates or a Transfer of such Certificate by the Depositor, any Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates or, in the case of a Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates, a Transfer thereof to a successor Depository or to the applicable Certificate Owner(s) in accordance with Section 5.03), then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such Transfer unless it receives (and, upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1A and a certificate from such Certificateholder’s

If a Transfer of any interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for any Class of Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates is to be made without registration under the Securities Act (other than in connection with the initial issuance of the Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificates or a Transfer of any interest therein by the Depositor, any Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates), then the Certificate Owner desiring to effect such Transfer shall be required to obtain either (i) a certificate from such Certificate Owner’s prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-2B, or (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the prospective Transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and that such Transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act.  Except as provided in the following two paragraphs, no interest in the Rule 144A Global Certificate for

(C)           Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement by a proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if a Responsible Officer of either the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar has actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee, no Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a Class R Certificate to such proposed Transferee shall be effected.

(ii)           (A)          If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a Class R Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section 5.02(d), then the last preceding Holder of such Class R Certificate that was in compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.02(d) shall be restored, to the extent permitted by law, to all rights as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of registration of such Transfer of such Class R Certificate.  None of the Depositor, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar shall be under any liability to any Person for any registration of Transfer of a Class R Certificate that is in fact not permitted by this Section 5.02(d) or for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof or for taking any

(e)           If a Person is acquiring any Non-Registered Certificate or interest therein as a fiduciary or agent for one or more accounts, such Person shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar (or, in the case of an interest in a Book-Entry Non-Registered Certificate, to the Certificate Owner that is transferring such interest) a certification to the effect that, and such

(l)            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Certificate Administrator shall comply with all federal withholding requirements respecting payments made or received under the Swap Contract and payments to Certificateholders of interest or original issue discount that the Certificate Administrator reasonably believes are applicable under the Code.  The consent of Certificateholders shall not be required for such withholding.  If the Certificate Administrator does withhold any amount from interest or original issue discount payments or advances thereof to any Certificateholder pursuant to federal withholding requirements, the Certificate Administrator shall indicate the amount withheld to such

Section 5.03(c) below, shall not be entitled to definitive, fully registered Certificates (“Definitive Certificates”) in respect of such Ownership Interests.  The Classes of Non-Registered Certificates initially sold to Qualified Institutional Buyers in reliance on Rule 144A or in reliance on another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act shall, in the case of each such Class, be represented by the Rule 144A Global Certificate for such Class, which shall be deposited with the Certificate Administrator as custodian for the Depository and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of the Depository.  The Classes of Non-Registered Certificates initially sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S shall, in the case of each such Class, be represented by the Regulation S Global Certificate for such Class, which shall be deposited with the Certificate Administrator

hereunder and, accordingly, shall be entitled directly to receive payments on, to exercise Voting Rights with respect to, and to transfer and exchange such Definitive Certificates.
 
(d)           Notwithstanding any other provisions contained herein, neither the Certificate Administrator nor the Certificate Registrar shall have any responsibility whatsoever to monitor or restrict the Transfer of ownership interests in any Certificate (including but not limited to any Non-Registered Certificate) which interests are transferable through the book-entry facilities of the Depository.

Registrar, as the case may be, acquired its Ownership Interest in a Book-Entry Certificate in violation of Section 5.02(c), or if such Person’s certification that it is a Certificate Owner is in direct conflict with information actually known by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar, with respect to the identity of a Certificate Owner.  The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Certificate Registrar shall each exercise its reasonable discretion in making any determination under this Section 5.06 and shall afford any Person providing information with respect to its beneficial ownership of any Book-Entry Certificate an opportunity to resolve any discrepancies between the information provided and any other information available to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar, as the case
may be.

Administrator is no longer the Authenticating Agent, any provision or requirement herein requiring notice or any information or documentation to be provided to the Authenticating Agent shall be construed to require that such notice, information or documentation also be provided to the Certificate Administrator.
 
(b)           Any Person into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion, or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Authenticating Agent.
 
(c)           Any Authenticating Agent appointed in accordance with this Section 5.07 may at any time resign by giving at least thirty (30) days’ advance written notice of resignation to the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor.  The Certificate Administrator may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent appointed in accordance with this Section 5.07 by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor.  Upon receiving a notice of such a resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.07,
the Certificate Administrator may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent, in which case the Certificate Administrator shall give written notice of such appointment to the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Depositor and shall mail notice of such appointment to all Holders of Certificates; provided, that no successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 5.07.  Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent.

indemnification shall extend (subject to the same limitations and qualifications) to any loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred by any such Person in connection with any actual or threatened legal action or claim relating to a Loan Combination (whether or not the Loan Combination is then being serviced under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), but the relevant party must promptly notify the Master Servicer and the Other Master Servicer of any claim (but the omission to so notify shall not relieve the Trust Fund from any liability which it may have to any such indemnified party under this Agreement except to the extent that such omission to notify materially prejudices the interests of the Trust Fund) and, if any indemnification payment is made to such party from general collections on the Mortgage Pool on deposit in the Collection Account, the Master Servicer will be required to use efforts
in accordance with the Servicing Standard to exercise promptly the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement from the holder of the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan for that holder’s allocable share of the amount so paid.
 
None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action unless such action is related to its respective duties under this Agreement and, except in the case of a legal action the costs of which such party is specifically required hereunder to bear, in its opinion does not involve it in any ultimate expense or liability for which it would not be reimbursed hereunder; provided, that the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor may in its discretion undertake any such action which it may reasonably deem necessary or desirable with respect to the enforcement and/or protection of the rights and duties of the parties hereto and the interests of the Certificateholders (or, if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved, the rights of the Certificateholders and the related Serviced
Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s) (as a collective whole).  In such event, the legal expenses and costs of such action, and any liability resulting therefrom, shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust, and the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor, as the case may be, shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account, as provided in Section 3.05(a), or the Distribution Account, as provided in Section 3.05(b) (or, with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, if such expenses and costs relate specifically to such Serviced Loan Combination, first, pro rata from the Collection Account and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (based on the respective outstanding principal balances of the related Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) and, if funds
in the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account are insufficient, then any deficiency shall be paid from amounts on deposit in the Collection Account).  Following reimbursement or payment of such amounts (with no obligation to repay such amounts), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, shall use efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to exercise promptly the rights of the Trust Fund under the related Intercreditor Agreement to obtain reimbursement from the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder (or if the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan is held by an Other Securitization, from such Other Securitization), of such Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder’s pro rata share of such amounts reimbursed by the Collection Account.  In no event will the Trust Advisor have any duty to appear in any legal proceedings in connection with this Agreement.
 
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, for the purposes of indemnification of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer and limitation of liability, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer will be deemed not to have engaged in willful misfeasance or
 


  


-321-





  


 
committed bad faith, fraud or negligence in the performance of its respective obligations or duties or acted in negligent disregard or other disregard of its respective obligations or duties hereunder if the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, fails to follow the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents because the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonably exercised judgment determines that following the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents would or potentially would result in an Adverse REMIC Event (for which determination, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall be entitled to rely on advice of counsel, the cost of which shall be reimbursed as an Additional Trust Fund Expense).  Any indemnification payments or reimbursements of costs or expenses described in the preceding paragraph to which the Trust Advisor may become entitled shall constitute Trust Advisor
Expenses and the payment of such Trust Advisor Expenses (other than those that constitute Designated Trust Advisor Expenses) shall be subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.05.  The Trust Advisor shall not be entitled to reimbursement of expenses for its services except those for which it is entitled to indemnification as described above.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if and to the extent that any loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense that is, pursuant to this Section 6.03(a), required to be borne by the Trust out of the Distribution Account or Collection Account, relates to any Serviced Loan Combination, (i) such loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense shall be payable out of amounts on deposit in respect of such Serviced Loan Combination in the Collection Account and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account collectively, prior to payment from funds in the Distribution Account or the Collection Account that are unrelated to such Serviced Loan Combination; and (ii) such loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense shall be payable out of amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and the
related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (withdrawals from those accounts shall be made in accordance with the related Intercreditor Agreement and pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal balances of the Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan included in the related Serviced Loan Combination).  Insofar as any such loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense related to any Serviced Loan Combination is so paid by withdrawal from the Collection Account or Distribution Account and funds are subsequently received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), then the Master Servicer shall deposit the amount of such loss, liability, claim, damages, penalty, fine, cost or expense into the Collection Account from such funds so received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
(b)           In addition, none of the Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer or any director, member, manager, officer, employee or agent of any such party shall have any liability with respect to, and each of the Depositor, the Trust Advisor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and any director, member, manager, officer, employee or agent of any such party shall be entitled to rely, as to the truth of the statements made therein and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, on any documents, certificates or opinions, including Opinions of Counsel, furnished to, and reasonably believed or in good faith believed by such Person to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties, which document, certificate or opinion, prima facie, is properly executed and submitted by any Person, or any employee or agent of any Person (including
legal counsel as to opinions), respecting any matters arising hereunder.  Each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trust Advisor may rely in good faith on information provided to it by the other parties hereto 
 


  


-322-





  


 
(unless the provider and the recipient of such information are the same Person or Affiliates) and by the Borrowers and property managers, and will have no duty to investigate or verify the accuracy thereof.  Each of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trust Advisor may rely, and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution, officer’s certificate, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, financial statement, agreement, appraisal, bond or other document (in electronic or paper format) as contemplated by and in accordance with this Agreement and reasonably believed or in good faith believed by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trust Advisor, or directors, members, officers, employees or agents of any such party as the case may be, to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties and each of them may consult with counsel, in which case any written advice of counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection with respect to any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel.  Furthermore, none of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer and the Trust Advisor or directors, members, officers, employees or agents of any such party shall have any liability under this Agreement for any failure of any other such Person (or any other party to this Agreement) to perform such Person’s obligations or duties hereunder.
 
Section 6.04     Resignation of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer.
 
(a)           Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer may resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it, upon a determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of applicable law with any other activities carried on by it (the other activities of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, so causing such a conflict being of a type and nature carried on by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, at the date of this Agreement).  Any such determination requiring the resignation of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect which shall be delivered to the Trustee, with a copy to the Certificate Administrator, the Subordinate Class Representative and the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder
(and each affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder).  Unless applicable law requires the resignation of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (as the case may be) to be effective immediately, and the Opinion of Counsel delivered pursuant to the prior sentence so states, no such resignation shall become effective until the Trustee or other successor shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the resigning party in accordance with Section 6.05 or Section 7.02 hereof; provided that, if no successor to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within ninety (90) days after the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, has given notice of such resignation, the resigning Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor thereto.
 
(b)           In addition, each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall have the right to resign at any other time, provided that (i) a willing successor thereto (including any such successor proposed by the resigning party) has been found that is, solely in the case of a successor to the Special Servicer if it is a resigning special servicer, acceptable to the Subordinate Class Representative (during any Subordinate Control Period), (ii) solely in the case of the Special Servicer if it is the resigning party, the resigning party has consulted with the 
 


  


-323-





  


 
Subordinate Class Representative (during any Collective Consultation Period) and the Trust Advisor (during any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period) with respect to the identity and quality of its proposed successor, (iii) the succession is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency (and, if applicable, from each Pari Passu Companion Rating Agency), (iv) the resigning party pays all costs and expenses in connection with such transfer (including the costs of obtaining Rating Agency Confirmation), (v) the successor accepts appointment in writing prior to the effectiveness of such resignation and (vi) the successor is not a Prohibited Party at the time of such succession unless the Depositor consents to the appointment in its reasonable discretion.
 
(c)           None of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall be permitted to resign except as contemplated in subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 6.04.  Consistent with the foregoing, none of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall (except in connection with any resignation thereby permitted above in this Section 6.04 or as otherwise expressly provided herein, including the provisions of Section 3.11(a), Section 3.22 and/or Section 6.02) assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder
to any other Person or delegate to, subcontract with, or authorize or appoint any other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to be performed by it hereunder.  If, pursuant to any provision hereof, the duties of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer are transferred to a successor thereto, the entire amount of compensation payable to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, that accrues pursuant hereto from and after the date of such transfer shall be payable to such successor, except (in the case of the Special Servicer) to the extent provided in Section 3.11(c).
 
(d)           The resigning Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each party to this Agreement, the Trust and each Rating Agency in connection with the resignation of such party and the transfer of its duties (including, but not limited to, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses associated with transferring Servicing Files to the successor).
 
Section 6.05     Replacement of Special Servicer.
 
(a)           During any Subordinate Control Period, the Majority Subordinate Certificateholder, or the Subordinate Class Representative on its behalf, will have the right to terminate the Special Servicer, with or without cause, and appoint itself or an Affiliate thereof or another Person as the successor Special Servicer.  It shall be a condition to such appointment that the successor Special Servicer be a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer and the conditions set forth in subsection (e) be satisfied.
 
(b)           During any Collective Consultation Period or Senior Consultation Period, upon (i) the written direction of Holders of Principal Balance Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Certificates on an aggregate basis, requesting a vote to terminate the Special Servicer and appoint a successor Special Servicer, (ii) payment by such Holders to the Certificate Administrator of the reasonable fees and expenses (including any fees and expenses of counsel 
 


  


-324-





  


 
or any Rating Agency) to be incurred by the Certificate Administrator in connection with administering such vote (which fees and expenses shall not be paid from the Trust Fund) and (iii) delivery by such Holders to the Certificate Administrator of a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to such termination and appointment of a successor (to be obtained at the expenses solely of such Certificateholders) and the equivalent from each Rating Agency hired to provide ratings with respect to any commercial mortgage-backed securities backed by the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan, the Certificate Administrator shall post such request on the Certificate Administrator’s Website and conduct the solicitation of votes of all Certificates in such regard.  Upon the written direction of Holders of Principal Balance Certificates
evidencing at least 75% of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Principal Balance Certificates on an aggregate basis, the Certificate Administrator shall terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Special Servicer under this Agreement and appoint the successor Special Servicer that was proposed by the Certificateholders requesting the vote.  Such termination and replacement shall be further conditioned on such successor Special Servicer being a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.05(e) to the extent that such conditions have not otherwise been satisfied.  Such termination shall also be subject to the terminated
Special Servicer’s rights to indemnification, payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances, and other rights set forth in this Agreement which survive termination.  If a proposed termination and replacement of the Special Servicer by Certificateholders as described above is not consummated within 180 days following the initial request of the Certificateholders who requested a vote, then the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force or effect (except that the Certificate Administrator shall be entitled to apply any amounts prepaid by such Certificateholders for expenses to pay any expenses incurred by the Certificate Administrator).
 
(c)           In addition, during any Senior Consultation Period, if the Trust Advisor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that the Special Servicer is not performing its duties under this Agreement in accordance with the Servicing Standard, the Trust Advisor will have the right to recommend the replacement of the Special Servicer.  In such event, the Trust Advisor shall deliver to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator, with a copy to the then-current Special Servicer, a written recommendation in electronic format and in the form of Exhibit O-3 attached hereto (which form may be modified or supplemented by the Trust Advisor from time to time to cure any ambiguity or error or to incorporate any additional information as it deems appropriate) detailing the reasons supporting its position and recommending a suggested replacement Special Servicer.  In
addition, the Certificate Administrator shall post such recommendation on the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b), and by mail transmit such recommendation to, conduct the solicitation of votes of, the Holders of all Certificates, according to such procedures (including the establishment of a record date for voting) as it determines.  Such notice and solicitation shall state that the proposed replacement, if approved by the Certificateholders, shall be subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.05(e) within 180 days following the initial recommendation of the Trust Advisor and that any approval granted by the requisite Certificateholders in the aggregate may not be revoked or withdrawn at any time.  The Trust Advisor’s recommendation
to replace the Special Servicer must be confirmed by an affirmative vote of Certificateholders having at least a majority of the aggregate Voting Rights (taking into 
 


  


-325-





  


 
account the allocation of any Appraisal Reduction Amounts in respect of the Mortgage Loans to notionally reduce the Class Principal Balances of the Principal Balance Certificates to which such Appraisal Reduction Amounts are allocable) of all Principal Balance Certificates on an aggregate basis.  In the event the Holders of such Principal Balance Certificates elect to remove and replace the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Trustee, the Trust Advisor and the then current Special Servicer, and the Certificate Administrator shall promptly request a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies with respect to the proposed removal and replacement, unless such Certificateholders themselves deliver such Rating Agency Confirmation.  In the event the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator receive a Rating Agency Confirmation from each of the Rating Agencies (and the
successor Special Servicer agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement), the Trustee will then be required to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Special Servicer under this Agreement and to appoint the successor Special Servicer that has been approved by the Certificateholders and constitutes a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer, and the Certificate Administrator shall post such notice on the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b).  The termination of the existing Special Servicer will be subject to the terminated Special Servicer’s rights to indemnification, payment of outstanding fees, reimbursement of Advances and other rights set forth in this Agreement which survive termination.  The Trustee and the Trust Advisor shall cooperate in using reasonable efforts to cause
the satisfaction of the conditions to the consummation of such replacement set forth in Section 6.05(e).  The reasonable costs and expenses associated with the Trust Advisor’s identification of a Qualified Replacement Special Servicer and the Certificate Administrator’s obtaining such Rating Agency Confirmations administering the vote of the Certificateholders shall be an Additional Trust Fund Expense.  If a proposed termination and replacement of the Special Servicer recommended by the Trust Advisor as described above is not consummated within 180 days following the initial recommendation of the Trust Advisor, then (i) the proposed termination and replacement shall have no further force or effect, (ii) the Certificate Administrator shall post such notice to the Certificate Administrator’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b) and
(iii) the Certificate Administrator shall notify the Trustee and the then-current Special Servicer.  The costs and expenses of administering the notices, solicitation of votes and otherwise incurred by the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee or the Trust Advisor in connection with the proposed replacement (including the costs and expenses associated with obtaining Rating Agency Confirmations and the Opinion of Counsel referred to in Section 6.05(e)) shall constitute expenses of the Trust Fund to be paid by withdrawal from the Distribution Account.  None of the Special Servicer, any Certificateholder or any other Person shall have any cause of action against the Trust Advisor or any other Person based upon or arising from the Trust Advisor’s determination under this Section 6.05(c), or the result of the vote of the Certificateholders.
 
(d)           [Reserved]
 
(e)           No removal of the Special Servicer and/or appointment of a successor thereto pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be effective until the Trustee shall have received (A) a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to such removal and/or appointment, (B) an Acknowledgment of Proposed Special Servicer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit I-2, executed by the Person designated to be the successor to the terminated Special Servicer, and (C) an Opinion of Counsel (the expense of which shall be deemed to be part of the expenses of the replacement) substantially to the effect that (1) such designated Person is duly 
 


  


-326-





  


 
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (2) the Acknowledgment of Proposed Special Servicer, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit I-2, has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by such designated Person and (3) upon the execution and delivery of the Acknowledgment of Proposed Special Servicer, such designated Person shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement and, subject to customary bankruptcy and insolvency exceptions and customary equity exceptions, this Agreement shall be enforceable against such designated Person in accordance with its terms.
 
(f)           Any Special Servicer terminated pursuant to this Section 6.05 shall be deemed to have been so terminated simultaneously with the designated successor’s becoming the Special Servicer hereunder; provided that (i) the terminated Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive, in connection with its termination, payment out of the Collection Account of all of its accrued and unpaid Special Servicing Fees, as and to the extent provided in Section 3.05(a), and reimbursement from the successor to such terminated Special Servicer of all outstanding Servicing Advances made by such terminated Special Servicer and all unpaid Advance Interest accrued on such outstanding Servicing Advances (in which case the successor to such terminated Special Servicer shall
be deemed to have made such Servicing Advances at the same time that such terminated Special Servicer had actually made them), (ii) such terminated Special Servicer shall thereafter be entitled to Workout Fees, as and to the extent expressly permitted by Section 3.11(c), and (iii) such terminated Special Servicer shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.03, notwithstanding any such termination; and provided, further, that such terminated Special Servicer shall continue to be obligated to pay (and entitled to receive) all other amounts accrued to (or owing by) it under this Agreement on or prior to the effective date of such termination.  Such terminated Special Servicer shall cooperate (time being of the essence in connection with a termination under Section 6.05(b))
with the Trustee and the replacement to such terminated Special Servicer in effecting the transfer of such terminated Special Servicer’s responsibilities and rights hereunder to its successor, including the transfer within two (2) Business Days of its termination becoming effective pursuant to this Section 6.05, to the replacement to such terminated Special Servicer for administration by it of all cash amounts that at the time are or should have been credited by such terminated Special Servicer to the REO Account maintained by it or to any Servicing Account or Reserve Account or should have been delivered to the Master Servicer or that are thereafter received by or on behalf of such terminated Special Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Property.  No penalty or fee shall be payable to the terminated Special Servicer in connection with any termination under this Section 6.05.
 
Section 6.06     Rights of the Depositor and the Trustee in Respect of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer.
 
Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall afford the Depositor and the Trustee, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours access to all records maintained by it in respect of its rights and obligations hereunder and access to such of its officers as are responsible for such obligations.  Upon reasonable request and as reasonably related to the performance of the obligations of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement, each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall furnish the Depositor and the Trustee with its most recent publicly available annual audited financial statements (or, if not available, the most recent publicly available audited annual 
 


  


-327-





  


 
financial statements of its corporate parent) and such other information as is publicly available regarding its business, affairs, property and condition, financial or otherwise.  Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer may affix to any such information described in this Section 6.06 provided by it any disclaimer it deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion.  The Depositor may, but is not obligated to, enforce the obligations of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer hereunder and may, but is not obligated to, perform, or cause a designee to perform, any defaulted obligation of any Master Servicer or the Special Servicer hereunder or exercise the rights of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer hereunder; provided, that neither the Master Servicer nor the Special Servicer shall be relieved of any of its obligations
hereunder by virtue of such performance by the Depositor or its designee.  The Depositor shall not have any responsibility or liability for any action or failure to act by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer and is not obligated to supervise the performance of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer under this Agreement or otherwise.
 
Section 6.07     Master Servicer and Special Servicer May Own Certificates.
 
Any Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Affiliate thereof may become the Holder of (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Certificate, Certificate Owner with respect to) any Certificate with (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of “Certificateholder”) the same rights it would have if it were not the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or an Affiliate thereof.  If, at any time during which any Master Servicer, Special Servicer or Affiliate of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer is the Holder of (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Certificate, Certificate Owner with respect to) any Certificate, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, proposes to take any action (including for this purpose, omitting to take a particular action) that is not expressly prohibited by the terms hereof and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Master
Servicer or the Special Servicer (as the case may be), violate the Servicing Standard, but that, if taken, might nonetheless, in the reasonable judgment of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer (as the case may be), be considered by other Persons to violate the Servicing Standard, then the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, may (but need not) seek the approval of the Certificateholders to such action by delivering to the Certificate Administrator (with a copy to the Trustee) a written notice that (a) states that it is delivered pursuant to this Section 6.07, (b) identifies the Percentage Interest in each Class of Certificates beneficially owned by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, or by an Affiliate thereof and (c) describes in reasonable detail the action that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, proposes to take.  The Certificate
Administrator, upon receipt of such notice, shall forward it to the Certificateholders (other than the Master Servicer and its Affiliates or the Special Servicer and its Affiliates, as appropriate), together with a request for approval by the Certificateholders of each such proposed action.  If at any time Certificateholders holding greater than 50% of the Voting Rights of all Certificateholders (calculated without regard to the Certificates beneficially owned by the Master Servicer or its Affiliates or the Special Servicer or its Affiliates, as the case may be) shall have consented in writing (with a copy to each related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved) to the proposal described in the written notice, and if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall act as proposed in the written notice, such action shall be deemed to comply with the Servicing Standard.  The Certificate Administrator
shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, for the reasonable expenses of the Certificate Administrator

incurred pursuant to this paragraph.  It is not the intent of the foregoing provision that the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer be permitted to invoke the procedure set forth herein with respect to routine servicing matters arising hereunder, but rather in the case of unusual circumstances.

Affected Party of such written notice, all of the responsibilities, duties, authority and power of the Affected Party under this Agreement (and in the case of a termination of the Special Servicer at the direction of a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder with respect to a Serviced Loan Combination, solely as they relate to such Serviced Loan Combination), whether with respect to the Certificates, the Mortgage Loans or otherwise (other than as a Holder of any Certificate or as a Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, if applicable), shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section, and, without limitation, the Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of and at the expense of the Affected Party, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise,

any and all documents and other instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, or otherwise (provided, that each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall, if terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(b), continue to be obligated to pay and entitled to receive all amounts accrued or owing by or to it under this Agreement on or prior to the date of such termination, whether in respect of Advances or otherwise, and it and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.03 notwithstanding
any such termination).  Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer agrees that, if it is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(b), it shall promptly (and in any event no later than twenty (20) days subsequent to its receipt of the notice of termination) provide the Trustee with all documents and records requested thereby to enable the Trustee to assume the functions hereunder of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, and shall otherwise cooperate with the Trustee in effecting the termination of the rights and responsibilities hereunder of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, including the transfer within five (5) Business Days to the Trustee for administration by it of all cash amounts that at the time are or should have been credited by the Master Servicer to the Collection Account or the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodian Account, the Distribution
Account or any Servicing Account or Reserve Account held by it (if it is the Affected Party) or by the Special Servicer to its REO Account, the Collection Account, the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account or any Servicing Account or Reserve Account held by it (if it is the Affected Party) or that are thereafter received by or on behalf of it with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Property (provided, that if the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer is terminated pursuant to this Section 7.01(b), the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, shall continue to be obligated to pay and entitled to receive all amounts accrued or owing by or to it under this Agreement on or prior to the date of such termination, whether in respect of Advances or otherwise, and it and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and agents shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Section 6.03 notwithstanding any such termination).  Any costs or expenses (including those of any other party hereto or successor master servicer or special servicer) incurred in connection with any actions to be taken by a terminated Master Servicer or Special Servicer pursuant to this paragraph (including, but not limited to, in connection with transferring Mortgage Files, Servicing Files and related information, records and reports to the successor master servicer or special servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect (as well as providing appropriate notices to borrowers, ground lessors, insurers and other applicable third parties regarding) such succession as successor master servicer or special servicer) shall be borne by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be (and, in the case of the Trustee’s costs and expenses, if not paid within a reasonable time,
shall be borne by the Trust out of the Collection Account).
 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.04, the Trustee shall not waive any Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xv) without the prior written consent of the Depositor.  If a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xiv) occurs on the part of the Master Servicer, or if any other Servicer Termination Event occurs on the part of the Master Servicer affecting a Serviced Loan Combination and the Master Servicer is not terminated pursuant to the provisions set forth above, whether as a result of a waiver or otherwise, any affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder shall be entitled to require the Master Servicer to appoint, in accordance with Section 3.22 and
with the delivery

of a Rating Agency Confirmation (and a rating agency confirmation with respect to any Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Securities backed by the affected Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan if the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement expressly requires such confirmation in connection with these circumstances), a Sub-Servicer to be selected by the Master Servicer, that will be responsible for primary servicing such Serviced Loan Combination.
 
(c)           Notwithstanding Section 7.01(b) of this Agreement, if the Master Servicer receives a notice of termination solely due to a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(x), (xi) or (xii), and the terminated Master Servicer provides the Trustee with the appropriate “request for proposal” materials within the five (5) Business Days after such termination, then the Master Servicer shall continue to serve as Master Servicer, if requested to do so by the Trustee, and the Trustee shall promptly thereafter (using such “request for proposal” materials provided by the terminated Master Servicer) solicit good faith bids for the rights to master service the Mortgage Loans
and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan under this Agreement from at least three (3) Persons qualified to act as successor Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 6.02 and Section 7.02 for which the Trustee has received Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency (and, if applicable, each Pari Passu Companion Rating Agency) obtained by the terminated Master Servicer (any such Person so qualified, a “Qualified Bidder”) or, if three (3) Qualified Bidders cannot be located, then from as many Persons as the Trustee can determine are Qualified Bidders; provided, that (i) at the Trustee’s request, the terminated Master Servicer shall supply the Trustee with the names of Persons from whom to solicit such bids; and (ii) the Trustee shall not be responsible if less than three
(3) or no Qualified Bidders submit bids for the right to master service the subject Mortgage Loans and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan under this Agreement.  The bid proposal shall require any Successful Bidder (as defined below), as a condition of such bid, to enter into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer and to agree to be bound by the terms hereof, within forty-five (45) days after the receipt by the Master Servicer of a notice of termination.  The Trustee shall solicit bids (i) on the basis of such successor Master Servicer retaining all applicable Sub-Servicers to continue the sub-servicing of the applicable Serviced Mortgage Loans pursuant to the terms of the respective Sub-Servicing Agreements and entering into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master Servicer to service each of the Serviced Mortgage Loans not subject to a Sub-Servicing Agreement at a sub-servicing fee rate per annum equal to, for each Serviced Mortgage
Loan serviced, the related Master Servicing Fee Rate minus the sum of one (1) basis point and the related Excess Servicing Fee Rate (each, a “Servicing-Retained Bid”) and (ii) on the basis of terminating each applicable Sub-Servicing Agreement and each applicable Sub-Servicer that it is permitted to terminate in accordance with Section 3.22 and having no obligation to enter into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master Servicer (each, a “Servicing-Released Bid”).  The Trustee shall select the Qualified Bidder with the highest cash Servicing-Retained Bid (or, if none, the highest cash Servicing-Released Bid) (the “Successful Bidder”) to act as successor Master Servicer hereunder.  The Trustee shall direct the Successful Bidder to enter into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer pursuant to the
terms hereof (and, if the successful bid was a Servicing-Retained Bid, to enter into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with the terminated Master Servicer as contemplated above), no later than forty-five (45) days after the termination of the terminated Master Servicer.
 
(d)           Upon the assignment and acceptance of the master servicing rights hereunder to and by the Successful Bidder, the Trustee shall remit or cause to be remitted to the 
 


  


-334-





  


 
terminated Master Servicer the amount of such cash bid received from the Successful Bidder (net of reasonable “out-of-pocket” expenses incurred in connection with obtaining such bid and transferring servicing).
 
(e)           If the Successful Bidder has not entered into this Agreement as successor Master Servicer within forty-five (45) days after the related Master Servicer received a notice of termination or no Successful Bidder was identified within such 45-day period, the terminated Master Servicer shall reimburse the Trustee for all reasonable “out-of-pocket” expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with such bid process and the Trustee shall have no further obligations under Section 7.01(c).  The Trustee thereafter may act or may select a successor to act as Master Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 7.02.
 
Section 7.02     Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.
 
On and after the time the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer resigns pursuant to Section 6.04(a) (and a successor Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, has not been appointed by the resigning Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, under Section 6.04), or receives a notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.01, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, in its capacity as such under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto and arising thereafter placed on the Master Servicer or the Special
Servicer, as the case may be, by the terms and provisions hereof, including, if the Master Servicer is the resigning or terminated party, the Master Servicer’s obligation to make Advances; provided, that (i) any failure to perform such duties or responsibilities caused by the failure of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, to cooperate or to provide information or monies as required by Section 7.01 shall not be considered a default by the Trustee hereunder and (ii) in the case of a terminated Master Servicer, the Trustee shall cease to act as successor Master Servicer if an alternative successor is appointed pursuant to Section 7.01(c).  Neither the Trustee nor any other successor shall be liable for any of the representations and warranties of the resigning or terminated party or for any losses incurred
by the resigning or terminated party pursuant to Section 3.06 hereunder nor shall the Trustee or any other successor be required to purchase any Mortgage Loan hereunder.  As compensation therefor, the Trustee shall be entitled to all fees and other compensation which the resigning or terminated party would have been entitled to for future services rendered if the resigning or terminated party had continued to act hereunder.  Notwithstanding the above, if it is unwilling to so act, the Trustee may (and, if it is unable to so act, or if the Trustee is not approved as an acceptable master servicer or special servicer, as the case may be, by each Rating Agency, or if the Holders of Certificates entitled to a majority of all the Voting Rights (determined without notionally reducing the Class Principal Balances of the Certificates by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts) (or, alternatively, if a Servicer Termination
Event on the part of the Special Servicer has occurred during a Subordinate Control Period, the Subordinate Class Representative) so requests in writing, the Trustee shall), promptly appoint, or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint, any established and qualified institution as the successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, hereunder; provided, that (i) such appointment is the subject of a Rating Agency Confirmation from each Rating Agency (and, if 
 


  


-335-





  


 
applicable, each Pari Passu Companion Rating Agency); and (ii) if such successor (in the case of a successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer) does not have the Master Servicer rating from Fitch that is “CMS2” or above, such successor is reasonably acceptable to the Subordinate Class Representative and, if such successor has a master servicer rating from Fitch that is “CMS2” or above, the Subordinate Class Representative shall have been consulted with respect to the identity of (although it need not have approved) such successor.  No appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer hereunder shall be effective until the assumption by such successor of all its responsibilities, duties and liabilities hereunder, and pending such appointment and assumption, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided.  In connection with any such appointment
and assumption, the Trustee may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on the Mortgage Loans or otherwise as it and such successor shall agree; provided, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the resigning or terminated party hereunder.  The Depositor, the Trustee, such successor and each other party hereto shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such succession.
 
If the Trustee or an Affiliate acts pursuant to this Section 7.02 as successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer and if the Excess Servicing Fee Rate is a rate per annum that is greater than zero (0) basis points, it may reduce the Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent that the Trustee’s or such Affiliate’s compensation as successor Master Servicer would otherwise be below the market rate servicing compensation.  If the Trustee elects to appoint a successor to the resigning or terminated Master Servicer other than itself or an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 7.02, it may reduce the Excess Servicing Fee Rate to the extent reasonably necessary (in the sole discretion of the Trustee) for the Trustee to appoint a qualified
successor Master Servicer that meets the requirements of this Section 7.02.
 
Section 7.03     Notification to Certificateholders.
 
(a)           Upon any resignation of the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 6.04, any replacement of the Special Servicer pursuant to Section 6.05, any termination of the Master Servicer or Special Servicer pursuant to Section 7.01, any appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer or Special Servicer pursuant to Section 6.02, 6.04 or 7.02 or the effectiveness of any designation of a new Special Servicer, the Trustee shall promptly notify (i) the Certificate Administrator, who shall give prompt written
notice thereof to Certificateholders at their respective addresses appearing in the Certificate Register, (ii) the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider, who shall promptly post such information on the Rule 17g-5 Information Provider’s Website in accordance with Section 8.12(b) and (iii) to the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder.
 
(b)           Not later than the later of (i) sixty (60) days after the occurrence of any event which constitutes or, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a Servicer Termination Event and (ii) five (5) days after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge of the occurrence of such an event, the Trustee shall notify the Depositor and the Certificate Administrator, who shall transmit by mail to all Certificateholders notice of such occurrence, unless such default shall have been cured.

Section 7.04     Waiver of Servicer Termination Event.
 
The Holders of Certificates representing at least 66-2/3% of the Voting Rights allocated to each Class of Certificates (and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holders, if affected) affected by any Servicer Termination Event hereunder (determined without notionally reducing the Class Principal Balances of the Certificates by any Appraisal Reduction Amounts) may waive such Servicer Termination Event without the consent of any other Person; provided , however that:
 
(a)           a Servicer Termination Event under clause (i), clause (ii), clause (iii), clause (x), clause (xi) or clause (xii) of Section 7.01(a) may be waived only by all of the Certificateholders of the affected Classes (and the Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder, if affected);
 
(b)           each Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder  shall be exclusively entitled to waive a Servicer Termination Event under Section 7.01(a)(xiv) that arises with respect to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan;
 
(c)           the Depositor shall be exclusively entitled to waive any Servicer Termination Event described in Section 7.01(a)(xv) (but if a Serviced Loan Combination is involved and the Pari Passu Companion Loan is the subject of an Other Securitization, the Depositor may not grant such a waiver without the consent of each Other Depositor with respect to each Other Securitization);
 
(d)           no waiver of any Servicer Termination Event by one or more Persons will have any force or effect unless and until the Person requesting the waiver at its own expense has reimbursed the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator for any monies spent by them in connection with such Servicer Termination Event, together with interest thereon from and including the date so spent to but excluding the date of reimbursement and payment to the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator.
 
Upon any such waiver of a Servicer Termination Event, such Servicer Termination Event shall cease to exist and shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose hereunder.  No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Servicer Termination Event or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, for purposes of waiving any Servicer Termination Event pursuant to this Section 7.04, Certificates registered in the name of the Depositor or any Affiliate of the Depositor shall be entitled to the same Voting Rights with respect to the matters described above as they would if registered in the name of any other Person.
 
Section 7.05     Additional Remedies of Trustee Upon Servicer Termination Event.
 
During the continuance of any Servicer Termination Event, so long as such Servicer Termination Event shall not have been remedied, the Trustee, in addition to the rights specified in Section 7.01, shall have the right (exercisable subject to Section 8.01(a)), in its own name and as trustee of an express trust (in the case of any matter affecting a Serviced Loan Combination) on behalf of the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Holder(s), to take all

(c)           No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Trustee, the Tax Administrator or the Certificate Administrator from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct; provided, that:

Section 8.05     Fees and Expenses of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator; Indemnification of and by the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator.
 
(a)           On each Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall withdraw from the Distribution Account, out of general collections on the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties on deposit therein, prior to any distributions to be made therefrom to Certificateholders on such date, and pay to itself all Certificate Administrator Fees, and to the Trustee all Trustee Fees, earned in respect of the Mortgage Loans and any successor REO Mortgage Loans through the end of the then most recently ended calendar month as compensation for all services rendered by the Trustee hereunder.  As to each Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan, the Trustee Fee and the Certificate Administrator Fee shall accrue during each calendar month, commencing with December 2012, at the Trustee Fee Rate or the Certificate Administrator Fee Rate, as the case may be, on a principal amount equal to the Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan or REO
Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, immediately following the Distribution Date in such calendar month (or, in the case of December 2012, on a principal amount equal to the Cut-off Date Principal Balance of the particular Mortgage Loan).  The Trustee Fee and the Certificate Administrator Fee accrued during each calendar month shall be payable in the next succeeding calendar month.  With respect to each Mortgage Loan and REO Mortgage Loan, the Trustee Fee and the Certificate Administrator Fee shall be calculated on the same Interest Accrual Basis as is applicable to the accrual or deemed accrual of interest on such Mortgage Loan or REO Mortgage Loan, as the case may be.  The Trustee Fee (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) and the Certificate Administrator Fee (the latter of which includes the Tax Administrator Fee) shall constitute the sole compensation of the Trustee and the Certificate Administrator
and the Tax Administrator, respectively, for such services to be rendered by it.  The Certificate Administrator shall be responsible for the payment of the Tax Administrator Fee.
 
Notwithstanding the prior paragraph, if and to the extent that any loss, liability, cost or expense that is, pursuant to the prior paragraph, required to be borne by the Trust out of the Distribution Account or a Collection Account, relates to any Mortgage Loan that is part of a Serviced Loan Combination, (i) such loss, liability, cost or expense shall be payable out of amounts on deposit in respect of such Serviced Loan Combination in the Collection Account and any related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account collectively, prior to payment from funds in the Distribution Account or a Collection Account that are unrelated to such Serviced Loan Combination; and (ii) such loss, liability, cost or expense shall be payable out of amounts on deposit in the Collection Account and the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan Custodial Account (withdrawals from those accounts shall be made in accordance with the related
Intercreditor Agreement and pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal balances of the Mortgage Loan and Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan included in the related Serviced Loan Combination).  Insofar as any such loss, liability, cost or expense related to any Serviced Loan Combination is so paid by withdrawal from the Collection Account or Distribution Account and funds are subsequently received and allocable to the related 
 


  


-344-





  


 
Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan(s), then the Master Servicer shall deposit the amount of such loss, liability, cost or expense into the Collection Account from such funds so received and allocable to the related Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan.
 
(b)           The Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator (each in its capacity as such or in its individual capacity) and any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates are entitled to be indemnified and held harmless by the Trust Fund out of the Collection Account and/or the Distribution Account, as and to the extent provided in Section 3.05, for and against any loss, liability, claim or expense (including costs and expenses of litigation, and of investigation, reasonable counsel fees, damages, judgments and amounts paid in settlement) arising out of, or incurred in connection with, this Agreement, the Certificates, the Mortgage Loans (unless, in the case of the Trustee, it incurs any such expense or liability in the capacity of successor to the Master Servicer or the
Special Servicer (as the case may be), in which case such expense or liability will be reimbursable thereto in the same manner as it would be for any other Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as the case may be) or any act or omission of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator relating to the exercise and performance of any of the rights and duties of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator hereunder; provided, that none of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 8.05(b) for (1) allocable overhead, such as costs for office space, office equipment, supplies and related expenses, employee salaries and related expenses and similar internal costs and expenses, (2) any cost or expense that does not constitute an “unanticipated expense” within the meaning
of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii), (3) any expense or liability specifically required to be borne thereby pursuant to the terms hereof or (4) any loss, liability, claim or expense incurred by reason of any breach on the part of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator of any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or any willful misconduct, bad faith, fraud or negligence in the performance of, or negligent disregard of, the Trustee’s, the Certificate Administrator’s or the Tax Administrator’s obligations and duties hereunder.
 
(c)           The Master Servicer and the Special Servicer each shall indemnify the Trust, the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator (each in their respective capacity as such and in their individual capacity) for and hold each of them harmless against any loss, liability, claim or expense that is a result of the Master Servicer’s or the Special Servicer’s, as the case may be, negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement, including the negligent use by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be, of any powers of attorney delivered to it by the Trustee pursuant to the provisions hereof and the Mortgage Loans serviced by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as the case may be; provided, that, if
the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator has been reimbursed for such loss, liability, claim or expense pursuant to Section 8.05(b), then the indemnity in favor of such Person provided for in this Section 8.05(c) with respect to such loss, liability, claim or expense shall be for the benefit of the Trust.  For the purposes of this paragraph, the Master Servicer or Special Servicer will be deemed not to have committed negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement if the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, fails to follow the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents because the Master Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, in its reasonably exercised judgment determines that following the terms of the Mortgage Loan Documents would or

(d)           Each of the Trustee, the Custodian, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator shall indemnify each of the Trust, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer and each other (each in their respective capacity as such and in their individual capacity) for and hold each of them harmless against any loss, liability, claim or expense that is a result of the Trustee’s, the Certificate Administrator’s, the Custodian’s or the Tax Administrator’s, as the case may be, negligent acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement; provided, that if such indemnified person has been reimbursed for such loss, liability, claim or expense pursuant to Section 6.03 or Section 8.05(b), as the case may be, then the indemnity in favor of such Person otherwise provided for
in this Section 8.05(d) with respect to such loss, liability, claim or expense shall be for the benefit of the Trust.
 
(e)           The Certificate Administrator shall indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor, each Mortgage Loan Seller and each Underwriter from and against any claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and expenses and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses incurred by the Depositor, each Mortgage Loan Seller, each Underwriter or any of their respective Affiliates that arise out of or are based upon (i) a breach by the Certificate Administrator, in its capacity as Rule 17g-5 Information Provider, of its obligations under this Agreement or (ii) negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Certificate Administrator, in its capacity as Rule 17g-5 Information Provider, in the performance of such obligations or its negligent disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
 
(f)           This Section 8.05 shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Tax Administrator, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer as regards rights and obligations prior to such termination, resignation or removal.

then the Depositor may (and, if it fails to do so within ten (10) Business Days, the Master Servicer shall as soon as practicable) remove the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as the case may be, and appoint a successor trustee, certificate administrator or tax administrator, as the case may be, by written instrument, in duplicate, which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator or the Tax Administrator, as the case may be, so removed and to the successor trustee, certificate administrator or tax administrator, as the case may be.  A copy of such instrument shall be delivered to the other parties hereto and to the Certificateholders by the Depositor.

(b)           Any single Subordinate Class Certificateholder or group of Subordinate Class Certificateholders, the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, in that order of preference (as set forth more fully below), may at its option elect to purchase all the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property (or, in the case of any REO Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the beneficial interest of the Trust Fund in such REO Property) remaining in the Trust Fund as contemplated by clause (i) of Section 9.01(a) by giving written notice to the other parties hereto (and, in the case of an election by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, to the Holders of the Subordinate Class) no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated date of purchase; provided, that:

Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund in accordance with the preceding sentence, such Sole Certificateholder(s), not later than the Business Day prior to the Distribution Date on which the final distribution on the Certificates is to occur, shall deposit in the Collection Account an amount in immediately available funds equal to all amounts then due and owing to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Tax Administrator and/or the Trustee hereunder (and their respective agents) that may be withdrawn from the Collection Account, pursuant to Section 3.05(a), or that may be withdrawn from the Distribution Account, pursuant to Section 3.05(b), but only to the extent that such amounts are not already on deposit in the Collection Account.  In addition, the Master Servicer shall transfer to the Distribution Account
all amounts required to be transferred by it to such account on the Master Servicer Remittance Date from the Collection Account pursuant to the first paragraph of Section 3.04(b).  Upon confirmation that such final deposits have been made and following the surrender of all the Certificates on the Final Distribution Date, the Trustee shall release or cause to be released to the Sole Certificateholder(s) (or any designee thereof), the Mortgage Files for the remaining Mortgage Loans and shall execute all assignments, endorsements and other instruments furnished to it by the Sole Certificateholder(s) as shall be necessary to effectuate transfer of the remaining Mortgage Loans and REO Properties to the Sole Certificateholder(s) (or any designee thereof).  For federal income tax purposes, such surrender and release shall be treated as a purchase of such Mortgage Loans and REO Properties for an amount of cash
equal to all amounts due in respect thereof after the distribution of amounts remaining in the Distribution Account, and a crediting of such amounts as a final distribution on all remaining REMIC I Regular Interests, REMIC II Regular Interests, Regular Certificates and the Class A-FX Regular Interest.
 
(c)           Notice of any termination shall be given promptly by the Certificate Administrator by letter to Certificateholders and the Swap Counterparty posted to the Certificate Administrator’s Website and mailed (x) if such notice is given in connection with the purchase

Administrator shall give such notice to the other parties hereto at the time such notice is given to Certificateholders.
 
(d)           Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates by the Certificateholders on the Final Distribution Date, the Certificate Administrator shall distribute to each Certificateholder so presenting and surrendering its Certificates such Certificateholder’s Percentage Interest of that portion of the amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account that is allocable to payments on the relevant Class in accordance with Section 4.01.  Any funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of Certificates of any Class on the Final Distribution Date because of the failure of such Holder or Holders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held uninvested in trust and credited to the account or accounts of the appropriate non-tendering Holder or Holders.  If any Certificates as to which notice has been
given pursuant to this Section 9.01 shall not have been surrendered for cancellation within six (6) months after the time specified in such notice, the Certificate Administrator shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to receive the final distribution with respect thereto.  If within one year after the second notice all such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the Certificate Administrator, directly or through an agent, shall take such reasonable steps to contact the remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning the surrender of their Certificates as it shall deem appropriate.  The costs and expenses of holding such funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders following the first anniversary of the delivery of such second notice to the non-tendering Certificateholders
shall be paid out of such funds.  No interest shall accrue or be payable to any former Holder on any amount held in trust hereunder.  If by the second anniversary of the delivery of such second notice, all of the Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, then, subject to applicable escheat laws, the Certificate Administrator shall distribute to the Class R Certificateholders all unclaimed funds and other assets which remain subject hereto.
 
Section 9.02     Additional Termination Requirements.
 
(a)           If any Subordinate Class Certificateholder(s), the Master Servicer, and/or the Special Servicer purchase(s), or the Sole Certificateholder(s) exchange(s) all of the Certificates for, all the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property (or, in the case of any REO Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the beneficial interest of the Trust Fund in such REO Property) remaining in the Trust Fund as provided in Section 9.01, the Trust and each REMIC Pool shall be terminated in accordance with the following additional requirements, unless the purchasing party obtains at its own expense and delivers to the Trustee and the

(ii)          during such 90-day liquidation period and at or prior to the time of making the final payment on the Certificates, the Certificate Administrator shall sell or otherwise transfer all the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund to the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the applicable Subordinate Class Certificateholder(s) or the Sole Certificateholder(s), as the case may be, in exchange for cash and/or Certificates in accordance with Section 9.01; and
 
(iii)          at the time of the final payment on the Certificates, the Certificate Administrator shall distribute or credit, or cause to be distributed or credited, to the Holders of the Certificates in accordance with Section 4.01 all remaining cash on hand (other than cash retained to meet claims), and each REMIC Pool shall terminate at that time.
 
(b)           By their acceptance of Certificates, the Holders of the Certificates hereby authorize the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator to prepare and adopt, on behalf of the Trust, a plan of complete liquidation of each REMIC Pool in the form of the notice of termination provided for in Section 9.01(c) and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, which authorization shall be binding upon all successor Certificateholders.
 
(c)           In the event the Trust Fund is to be terminated while the Swap Contract is still in effect, the Certificate Administrator shall promptly notify the Swap Counterparty in writing of the date on which the Trust Fund is to be terminated and that the notional amount of the Swap Contract will be reduced to zero on such date.  Based on the date of termination, the Certificate Administrator shall calculate the Class A-FL Net Swap Payment, if any, as specified in Section 3.29, and prior to any final distributions to the Holders of the Class A-FL Certificates, pursuant to Section 9.01, shall pay such Class A-FL Net Swap Payment, Recovered Interest Amounts, Yield Maintenance Charges and Prepayment
Premiums, if any, to the Swap Counterparty.  In the event that any fees (including termination fees) are payable to the Swap Counterparty in connection with such termination, such fees will be payable to the Swap Counterparty solely from amounts remaining in the Class A-FL Sub-Account after all distributions to the Class A-FL Certificates are made pursuant to Section 9.01.

(j)           Except as otherwise permitted by Section 3.17(a), none of the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or the Trustee shall enter into any arrangement by which any REMIC Pool will receive a fee or other compensation for services or, to the extent it is within the

a result of a determination by the IRS that is contrary to the first sentence of this paragraph.
 
(i)            The Tax Administrator, in its discretion, will report required WHFIT information using either the cash or accrual method, except to the extent the WHFIT Regulations specifically require a different method.  The Tax Administrator will be under no obligation to determine whether any Certificateholder uses the cash or accrual method.  The Tax Administrator will make available WHFIT information to Certificateholders annually.  In addition, the Tax Administrator will not be responsible or liable for providing subsequently amended, revised or updated information to any Certificateholder, unless requested by the Certificateholder.
 
(j)            The Tax Administrator shall not be liable for failure to meet the reporting requirements of the WHFIT Regulations nor for any penalties thereunder if such failure is due to:  (i) the lack of reasonably necessary information being provided to the Tax Administrator or (ii) incomplete, inaccurate or untimely information being provided to the Tax Administrator.  Each owner of a class of securities representing, in whole or in part, beneficial ownership of an interest in a WHFIT, by acceptance of its interest in such class of securities, will be deemed to have agreed to provide the Tax Administrator with information regarding any sale of such securities, including the price, amount of proceeds and date of sale.  Absent receipt of such information, and unless informed otherwise by the Depositor, the Tax Administrator will assume there is no secondary market trading of WHFIT interests.
 
(k)           To the extent required by the WHFIT Regulations, the Tax Administrator will use reasonable efforts to publish on an appropriate website the CUSIPs for the Certificates

that represent ownership of a WHFIT.  The CUSIPs so published will represent the Rule 144A CUSIPs.  The Tax Administrator will not publish any associated Regulation S CUSIPs.  The Tax Administrator will make reasonable good faith efforts to keep the website accurate and updated to the extent CUSIPs have been received.  Absent the receipt of a CUSIP, the Tax Administrator will use a reasonable identifier number in lieu of a CUSIP.  The Tax Administrator will not be liable for investor reporting delays that result from the receipt of inaccurate or untimely CUSIP information.
 
Section 10.03     The Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer to Cooperate with the Tax Administrator. (a)  The Depositor shall provide or cause to be provided to the Tax Administrator, within ten (10) days after the Closing Date, all information or data that the Tax Administrator reasonably determines to be relevant for tax purposes as to the valuations and Issue Prices of the Certificates, including the price, yield, prepayment assumption and projected cash flow of the Certificates.
 
(b)           Each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall furnish such reports, certifications and information in its possession, and access to such books and records maintained thereby, as may relate to the Certificates or the Trust Fund and as shall be reasonably requested by the Tax Administrator in order to enable it to perform its duties under this Article X.

a representation regarding certain matters from the management of such Reporting Servicer, which includes an assessment from such Reporting Servicer of its compliance with the Relevant Servicing Criteria in all material respects, and (ii) on the basis of an examination conducted by such firm in accordance with standards for attestation engagements issued or adopted by the PCAOB, it is expressing an opinion as to whether such Reporting Servicer’s compliance with the Relevant Servicing Criteria was fairly stated in all material respects, or it cannot express an overall opinion regarding such Reporting Servicer’s assessment of compliance with the Relevant Servicing Criteria.  If an overall opinion cannot be expressed, such registered public accounting firm shall state in such report why it was

Other Securitization that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or Certificate Administrator (or any Other Trustee related to an Other Securitization that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) under this Article XI by the time required after giving effect to any applicable grace period or cure period or (ii) the failure of any Servicing Function Participant or Additional Servicer retained by it (other than a Designated Sub-Servicer) to perform its obligations to the Depositor (or any Other Depositor related to an Other Securitization that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) or Certificate Administrator (or any Other Trustee related to an Other Securitization that includes a Serviced Pari Passu Companion Loan) under this Article XI by the time required after giving effect to any applicable grace period and cure period.
 
The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator and the Trustee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each related Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to indemnify and hold harmless the Certification Parties from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees 
 


  


-389-





  


 
and expenses and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses incurred by such Certification Party arising out of a breach of its obligations to provide any of the annual compliance statements or annual assessment of servicing criteria or attestation reports pursuant to this Agreement, or the applicable Sub-Servicing Agreement or primary servicing agreement, as applicable.
 
If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless any Certification Party, then the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Trust Advisor, each Additional Servicer or other Servicing Function Participant (the “Performing Party”) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans, to contribute to the amount paid or payable to the Certification Party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Certification Party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Certification Party on the one hand and the Performing Party on the other in connection with a breach of the Performing Party’s obligations
pursuant to this Article XI.  The Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Certificate Administrator, the Trust Advisor and the Trustee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each related Servicing Function Participant (other than any party to this Agreement) with which it has entered into a servicing relationship with respect to the Mortgage Loans to agree to the foregoing indemnification and contribution obligations.
 
Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party hereunder, notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof; but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under this Agreement except to the extent that such omission to notify materially prejudices the indemnifying party.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, after the indemnifying party has been notified of the commencement of such action, such indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein (at its own expense) and, to the extent that it may wish, shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof (jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified) with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election to so assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any expenses subsequently incurred in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation.  In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them or (iii) the indemnifying party fails, within a reasonable period of time, to designate counsel that is reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) in any one jurisdiction separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties 
 


  


-390-





  


 
in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.  An indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent.  However, if settled with such consent, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement to the extent that the indemnifying party is otherwise required to do so under this Agreement.  If an indemnifying party assumes the defense of any proceeding, it shall be entitled to settle such proceeding with the consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or, if such settlement (i) provides for an unconditional release of the indemnified party in connection with all matters relating to the proceeding that have been asserted against the indemnified
party in such proceeding by the other parties to such settlement and (ii) does not require an admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the consent of the indemnified party.

reports and certificates will not result in a downgrade, qualification or withdrawal of the then current rating of the Certificates.

This Certificate shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements negotiated, made and to be performed entirely in said State, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the Holder hereof shall be determined in accordance with such laws.

(and, upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) either:  (i) a certificate from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C-2A to the Agreement and a certificate from such Certificateholder’s prospective Transferee substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C-2B to the Agreement; or (ii) an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to the Certificate Administrator to the effect that such prospective Transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer and such Transfer may be made without registration under the Securities Act (which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Tax Administrator, the Custodian or the Certificate Registrar in their respective capacities as such), together with the written certification(s) as to the facts surrounding
such Transfer from the Certificateholder desiring to effect such Transfer and/or such Certificateholder’s prospective Transferee on which such Opinion of Counsel is based.
 
None of the Depositor, the Initial Purchasers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Tax Administrator, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar or the Trust Advisor is obligated to register or qualify the Class R Certificates under the Securities Act or any other securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Agreement to permit the transfer of this Certificate or any interest herein without registration or qualification.  Any Certificateholder or Certificate Owner desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate or any interest herein shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Depositor, the Initial Purchasers, the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Tax Administrator, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar and the Trust Advisor against any liability that may result if the transfer is not
so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws or the provisions described above.
 
Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in this Certificate shall be deemed by its acceptance or acquisition of such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the Agreement and, if any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of this Certificate in violation of the provisions of such Section 5.02(d), to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate Administrator (i) to deliver payments to a Person other than such Person and (ii) to negotiate the terms of any mandatory disposition, to execute all instruments of Transfer and to do all other things necessary in connection with any such disposition.  Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this Certificate must be a Permitted Transferee and shall promptly notify the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator of any change or impending change in its status
as a Permitted Transferee.  In connection with any proposed Transfer of any Ownership Interest in this Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall require delivery to it, and shall not register the Transfer of this Certificate until its receipt of, an affidavit and agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit E-1 to the Agreement (a “Transfer Affidavit and Agreement”) from the proposed Transferee, representing and warranting, among other things, that such Transferee is a Permitted Transferee, that it is not acquiring its Ownership Interest in this Certificate as a nominee, trustee or agent for any Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.  Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement by a proposed Transferee, if a Responsible Officer of either the Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Administrator has actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is not a Permitted Transferee, no Transfer
of an Ownership Interest in this Certificate to such proposed Transferee shall be effected.  [In connection therewith, the Certificate Registrar
 


  


A-2-5





  


 
shall not register the transfer of an Ownership Interest in this Certificate to any entity classified as a partnership under the Code unless at the time of transfer, all of its beneficial owners are, and under the partnership agreements are required to be, United States Securities Persons.]
 
Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this Certificate shall agree (x) to require a Transfer Affidavit and Agreement from any other Person to whom such Person attempts to transfer its Ownership Interest herein and (y) not to transfer its Ownership Interest herein unless it provides to the Certificate Registrar a certificate substantially in the form attached as Exhibit E-2 to the Agreement stating that, among other things, it has no actual knowledge that such other Person is not a Permitted Transferee.  Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in this Certificate, by purchasing such Ownership Interest herein, agrees to give the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator written notice that it is a “pass-through interest holder” within the meaning of temporary Treasury Regulation Section 1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A) immediately upon acquiring such Ownership Interest,
if it is, or is holding such Ownership Interest on behalf of, a “pass-through interest holder.”
 
If a Person is acquiring this Certificate as a fiduciary or agent for one or more accounts, such Person shall be required to deliver to the Certificate Registrar a certification to the effect that, and such other evidence as may be reasonably required by the Certificate Registrar to confirm that, it has (i) sole investment discretion with respect to each such account and (ii) full power to make the acknowledgments, representations, warranties, certifications and/or agreements with respect to each such account described above in this Certificate.
 
The provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the Agreement may be modified, added to or eliminated, provided that there shall have been delivered to the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator the following:  (a) a Rating Agency Confirmation with respect to such modification of, addition to or elimination of such provisions; and (b) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to the Certificate Administrator and the Tax Administrator, to the effect that such modification of, addition to or elimination of such provisions will not cause any REMIC Pool to cease to qualify as a REMIC or be subject to an entity-level tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee, or cause a Person other than the prospective Transferee to be subject to a REMIC-related tax caused by the Transfer of a Class R Certificate to a Person that is not a Permitted
Transferee.
 
A “Permitted Transferee” is any Transferee other than a “Disqualified Organization”, a “Disqualified Non-United States Tax Person” or a “Disqualified Partnership” (each as defined in the Agreement) and other than a foreign permanent establishment or fixed base (each within the meaning of any applicable income tax treaty) of a United States Tax Person or any other Person as to whom the transfer of this Certificate may cause any REMIC Pool to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.
 
As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the offices of the Certificate Registrar, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in the form satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations
 


  


A-2-6





  


 
evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.
 
No service charge will be imposed for any transfer or exchange of this Certificate, but the Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of this Certificate.
 
The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Trust Advisor, the Tax Administrator, the Custodian, the Certificate Registrar and any agent of any such party may treat the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of such parties or such agents shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
 
Subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Trust and the obligations created by the Agreement shall terminate upon payment (or provision for payment) to the Certificateholders of all amounts held by the Certificate Administrator on behalf of the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan or REO Property remaining in the Trust Fund; (ii) the purchase by the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or any single Subordinate Class Certificateholder or group of Subordinate Class Certificateholders, at a price determined as provided in the Agreement, of all the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property (or, in the case of any REO Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the beneficial interest of the Trust Fund in such REO Property) remaining in
the Trust Fund; and (iii) the exchange by the Sole Certificateholder(s) of all the Certificates for all Mortgage Loans and each REO Property (or, in the case of any REO Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the beneficial interest of the Trust Fund in such REO Property) remaining in the Trust Fund with the written consent of the Master Servicer in its sole discretion.  The Agreement permits, but does not require, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer or any single Subordinate Class Certificateholder or group of Subordinate Class Certificateholders to purchase from the Trust Fund all the Mortgage Loans and each REO Property (or, in the case of any REO Property related to any Serviced Loan Combination, the beneficial interest of the Trust Fund in such REO Property) remaining therein.  The exercise of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such right to purchase is subject to the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Pool at the time of purchase being 1.0% or less of the Cut-off Date Pool Balance.
 
The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the parties to the Agreement with the consent of the Holders of Certificates entitled to not less than 66-2/3% of the Voting Rights allocated to all of the Classes materially affected by the amendment and, if adversely affected by the amendment, any third-party beneficiary.  Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate.  The Agreement also permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, including any amendment
 


  


A-2-7





  


 
 necessary to maintain the status of any REMIC Pool as a REMIC, without the consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any purpose.
 
The registered Holder hereof, by its acceptance hereof, agrees that it will look solely to the Trust Fund (to the extent of its rights therein) for distributions hereunder.
 
This Certificate shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to agreements negotiated, made and to be performed entirely in said State, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the Holder hereof shall be determined in accordance with such laws.

The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the parties to the Agreement with the consent of the Holders of Certificates entitled to not less than 66-2/3% of the Voting Rights allocated to all of the Classes materially affected by the amendment and, if adversely affected by the amendment, any third-party beneficiary.  Any such consent by the Holder of this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate.  The Agreement also permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, including any amendment necessary

Schedule A

(To Issuer Letter of Representations)
 
SAMPLE OFFERING DOCUMENT LANGUAGE 
DESCRIBING BOOK-ENTRY-ONLY ISSUANCE
(Prepared by DTC—bracketed material may be applicable only to certain issues)
 
1.           The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (the “Securities”). The Securities will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.]
 
2.           DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry
transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts.  This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations
that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”).   DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+.  The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.
 
3.           Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC’s records.   The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.   Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their
ownership interests in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued.
 
4.           To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized represent ative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may  not be  the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Schedule A
(To Issuer Letter of Representations)
 
5.            Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  [Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided
directly to them.]
 
[6.          Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.]
 
7.           Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
 
8.           Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, Agent, or Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such
other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC,   and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.
 
[9.          A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to [ Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant’s interest in the Securities, on DTC’s records, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent.  The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Direct Participants on DTC’s records and followed by a book-entry credit of tendered Securities to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent’s DTC account.]
 
10.         DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered.
 
11.         Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC.
 
12.         The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

1A “Legally Restricted Security” is a security that is a restricted security, as defined in Rule 144(a)(3). A “Contractually Restricted Security” is a security that upon issuance and continually thereafter can only be sold pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act, Rule 144A, Rule 144, or in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4 of the Securities Act and not involving any public offering; provided, however, that once the security is sold pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144, including Rule 144(b)(l), it will thereby cease to be a “Contractually Restricted Security.” For purposes of this definition, in order for a depositary receipt to be considered a “Legally or Contractually Restricted Security,” the underlying security must also
be a “Legally or Contractually Restricted Security.”

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This letter is delivered to you in connection with the transfer by               (the “Transferor”) to                (the “Transferee”) of the Transferred Certificates.  The Certificates, including the Transferred Certificates, were issued pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 1, 2012 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), among Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Securities, Inc., as Depositor (the “Depositor”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Master Servicer, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as Special Servicer, Wells

3.           The Transferor and any person acting on behalf of the Transferor in this matter reasonably believe that the Transferee is a “qualified institutional buyer” as that term is defined in Rule 144A (“Rule 144A”) under the Securities Act (a “Qualified Institutional Buyer”) purchasing for its own account or for the account of another person that is itself a Qualified Institutional Buyer.  In determining whether the Transferee is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, the Transferor and any person acting on behalf of the Transferor in this matter have relied upon the following method(s) of establishing the Transferee’s ownership and discretionary investments of securities (check one or more):
 




  


____

____



(b)          The most recent publicly available information appearing in documents filed by the Transferee with the Securities and Exchange Commission or another United States federal, state, or local governmental agency or self-regulatory organization, or with a foreign governmental agency or self-regulatory organization, which information is as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of the Transferred Certificates in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or




 




  


____



(c)          The most recent publicly available information appearing in a recognized securities manual, which information is as of a date within 16 months preceding the date of sale of the Transferred Certificates in the case of a U.S. purchaser and within 18 months preceding such date of sale for a foreign purchaser; or




 




  


____



(d)          A certification by the chief financial officer, a person fulfilling an equivalent function, or other executive officer of the Transferee, specifying the amount of securities owned and invested on a discretionary basis by the Transferee as of a specific date on or since the close of the Transferee’s most recent fiscal year, or, in the case of a 




 


  


C-2A-2





  


 



 

 



Transferee that is a member of a “family of investment companies”, as that term is defined in Rule 144A, a certification by an executive officer of the investment adviser specifying the amount of securities owned by the “family of investment companies” as of a specific date on or since the close of the Transferee’s most recent fiscal year.




 
4.           The Transferor and any person acting on behalf of the Transferor understand that in determining the aggregate amount of securities owned and invested on a discretionary basis by an entity for purposes of establishing whether such entity is a Qualified Institutional Buyer:
 
(a)           the following instruments and interests shall be excluded:  securities of issuers that are affiliated with such entity; securities that are part of an unsold allotment to or subscription by such entity, if such entity is a dealer; securities of issuers that are part of such entity’s “family of investment companies”, if such entity is a registered investment company; bank deposit notes and certificates of deposit; loan participations; repurchase agreements; securities owned but subject to a repurchase agreement; and currency, interest rate and commodity swaps;
 
(b)           the aggregate value of the securities shall be the cost of such securities, except where the entity reports its securities holdings in its financial statements on the basis of their market value, and no current information with respect to the cost of those securities has been published, in which case the securities may be valued at market;
 
(c)           securities owned by subsidiaries of the entity that are consolidated with the entity in its financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles may be included if the investments of such subsidiaries are managed under the direction of the entity, except that, unless the entity is a reporting company under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, securities owned by such subsidiaries may not be included if the entity itself is a majority owned subsidiary that would be included in the consolidated financial statements of another enterprise.
 
5.           The Transferor or a person acting on its behalf has taken reasonable steps to ensure that the Transferee is aware that the Transferor is relying on the exemption from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act provided by Rule 144A.
 
6.           The Transferor or a person acting on its behalf has furnished, or caused to be furnished, to the Transferee all information regarding (a) the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (b) the Transferred Certificates and distributions thereon, (c) the nature, performance and servicing of the Mortgage Loans, (d) the Trust and Trust Fund, (e) the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreements and (f) all related matters, that the Transferee has requested.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
This letter is delivered to you in connection with the transfer by _________________ (the “Transferor”) to _________________ (the “Transferee”) of the Excess Servicing Fee Right established under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2012 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), among Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Securities, Inc., as Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Master Servicer, as Certificate Administrator, as Tax Administrator and as Custodian, Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, as Special Servicer, Pentalpha Surveillance LLC, as Trust Advisor, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee.  All capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.  The Transferee hereby certifies, represents and warrants to you, as the Depositor and the applicable Master Servicer, that:
 
1.           The Transferee is acquiring the right to receive Excess Servicing Fees (the “Excess Servicing Fee Right”) for its own account for investment and not with a view to or for sale or transfer in connection with any distribution thereof, in whole or in part, in any manner which would violate the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any applicable state securities laws.
 
2.           The Transferee understands that (a) the Excess Servicing Fee Right has not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or registered or qualified under any applicable state securities laws, (b) none of the Depositor, the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or the Certificate Registrar is obligated so to register or qualify the Excess Servicing Fee Right, and (c) the Excess Servicing Fee Right may not be resold or transferred unless it is (i) registered pursuant to the Securities Act and registered or qualified pursuant to any applicable state 
 


  


F-3B-1

3.           The Transferee understands that it may not sell or otherwise transfer the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any interest therein except in compliance with the provisions of Section 3.11 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, which provisions it has carefully reviewed.
 
4.           Neither the Transferee nor anyone acting on its behalf has (a) offered, pledged, sold, disposed of or otherwise transferred the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security to any person in any manner, (b) solicited any offer to buy or accept a pledge, disposition or other transfer of the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security from any person in any manner, (c) otherwise approached or negotiated with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security with any person in any manner, (d) made any general solicitation with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security by means of general advertising or in any other manner, or (e) taken any other action
with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security, which (in the case of any of the acts described in clauses (a) through (e) above) would constitute a distribution of the Excess Servicing Fee Right under the Securities Act, would render the disposition of the Excess Servicing Fee Right a violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act or any state securities law or would require registration or qualification of the Excess Servicing Fee Right pursuant thereto.  The Transferee will not act, nor has it authorized or will it authorize any person to act, in any manner set forth in the foregoing sentence with respect to the Excess Servicing Fee Right, any interest in the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any other similar security.

7.           The Transferee agrees (i) to keep all information relating to the Trust, the Trust Fund and the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and made available to it, confidential, (ii) not to use or disclose such information in any manner which could result in a violation of any provision of the Securities Act or would require registration of the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any Certificate pursuant to the Securities Act, and (iii) not to disclose such information, and to cause its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents or representatives not to disclose such information, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, to any other Person other than such holder’s auditors, legal counsel and regulators, except to the extent such disclosure is required by law, court order or other legal requirement or to the extent such information is of public knowledge at the time of disclosure by such holder or
has become generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by such holder; provided, however, that such holder may provide all or any part of such information to any other Person who is contemplating an acquisition of the Excess Servicing Fee Right if, and only if, such Person (x) confirms in writing such prospective acquisition and (y) agrees in writing to keep such information confidential, not to use or disclose such information in any manner which could result in a violation of any provision of the Securities Act or would require registration of the Excess Servicing Fee Right or any Certificates pursuant to the Securities Act and not to disclose such information, and to cause its officers, directors, partners, employees, agents or representatives not to disclose such information, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, to any other Person other than such Persons’ auditors, legal counsel and regulators.

2.           Certify that each of the following is true, subject to those exceptions set forth with explanatory notes on Schedule A hereto, which exceptions the Master Servicer has determined, consistent with the Servicing Standard, will have no material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan or the defeasance transaction:

g.


The Agreement executed in connection with the defeasance shall grant control of the pledged Securities Account to the Trustee and require the Securities Intermediary to make the scheduled payments on the Mortgage Loan from the proceeds of the defeasance collateral directly to the Master Servicer’s collection account in the amounts and on the dates specified in the Mortgage Loan Documents or, in a partial defeasance, the portion of such scheduled payments attributed to the allocated loan amount for the real property defeased, increased by any defeasance premium specified in the Mortgage Loan Documents (the “Scheduled Payments”).



 




  


h.

i.


The Master Servicer received opinions from counsel, who were approved by the Master Servicer in accordance with the  Servicing Standard, that (i) the agreements executed by the Borrower and/or the Defeasance Obligor in connection with the defeasance are enforceable against them in accordance with their terms except as such enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor’s rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and (ii) the Trustee will have a perfected, first priority security interest in the defeasance collateral described above.

MASTER AGREEMENT


dated as of 12/19 2012
 
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2012-C10
 
have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a “Transaction”) that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the “Schedule”), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a “Confirmation”) exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions.
 
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows: —






1.


Interpretation



 
(a)           Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.


(b)           Inconsistency. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.


(c)           Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this “Agreement”), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.






2.


Obligations



 
(a)           General Conditions.


(i)       Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.


(ii)      Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.


(iii)     Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b)           Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.






(c)


Netting. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:—



 




  


  (i)


  in the same currency; and



 




  


  (ii)


  in respect of the same Transaction,



 
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party’s obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
 
The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.
 




(d)


Deduction or Withholding for Tax.



 
(i)       Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party (“X”) will:—


(1)       promptly notify the other party (“Y”) of such requirement;


(2)       pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;


(3)       promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and


(4)       if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for:—
 
(A)       the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or
 
(B)       the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

 (ii)


Liability. If: —



 
(1)       X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);



(2)        X does not so deduct or withhold; and

 

(3)         a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X,



then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).


(e)           Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
 




3.


Representations



 
Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement) that:—
 




(a)


Basic Representations.



 
(i)        Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws, in good standing;
 
(ii)       Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance;
 
(iii)      No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets;
 
(iv)      Consents. All governmental and other consents that are required to have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied with; and
 
(v)       Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this Agreement and any Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).

 
ISDA® 1992

 


  


3





  


 
(b)           Absence of Certain Events. No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event
with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.
 
(c)           Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.
 
(d)           Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect.

(f)           Payee Tax Representations. Each representation specified in the Schedule as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.

(a)           Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing authority as the other party reasonably directs:—
 
(i)        any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation;
 

(ii)        any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and

 
(iii)      upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification,


in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.


(b)           Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future.


(c)           Comply with Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

5.


 Events of Default and Termination Events



 
(a)           Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an “Event of Default”) with respect to such party:—


(i)        Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the party;


(ii)       Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the party;
 

(iii)      Credit Support Default.



(1)       Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform any agreement or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed;


(2)       the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of such Credit Support Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or


(3)       the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;


(iv)      Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated;


(v)       Default under Specified Transaction.

or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);


(vi)      Cross Default. If “Cross Default” is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event of default or other similar condition or event (however

described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount under such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable
notice requirement or grace period);


(vii)     Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party: —
 
(1)       is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within
30 days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events
specified in clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or


(viii)    Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer: —


(1)       the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or


(2)       the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement.


(b)           Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii) below or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event
 

ISDA® 1992

Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below:—

 
(i)        Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party): —


(1)       to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or


(2)       to perform, or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction;
 
(ii)       Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional
amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));
 
(iii)      Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the “Burdened Party”) on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring
all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii);


(iv)      Credit Event Upon Merger. If “Credit Event Upon Merger” is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party (“X”), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X
or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or


(v)       Additional Termination Event. If any “Additional Termination Event” is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
 
(c)           Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.

Early Termination



 
(a)           Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the “Defaulting Party”) has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the “Non-defaulting Party”) may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, “Automatic Early Termination” is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early
Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
 




(b)


Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.



 
(i)        Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require.
 
(ii)       Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected
Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.


If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).
 
Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party’s policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.
 
(iii)      Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.



(iv)      Right to Terminate. If: —



(1)      a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or


(2)      an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,


either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then
 

ISDA® 1992

continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.






(c)


 Effect of Designation.



 
(i)       If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.


(ii)      Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e).






(d)


 Calculations.



 
(i)        Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation.


(ii)       Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis
of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed.


(e)           Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the following provisions shall apply based on the parties’ election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either “Market Quotation” or “Loss”, and a payment method, either the “First Method” or the “Second Method”. If the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that “Market Quotation” or the “Second Method”, as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.
 
(i)        Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default: —


(1)       First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.


(2)       First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Party’s Loss in respect of this Agreement.


(3)       Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the
 

ISDA® 1992

Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.


(4)       Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Party’s Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.






  


(ii)


  Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event: —



 
(1)      One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.



(2)       Two Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties: —

 
(A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the party with the higher Settlement Amount (“X”) and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount (“Y”) and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and


(B) if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss (“X”) and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss (“Y”).
 
If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y.


(iii)      Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because “Automatic Early Termination” applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).


(iv)      Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.


Transfer



 
Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that: —


(a)          a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and


(b)          a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).
 
Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section will be void.






8.


Contractual Currency



 
(a)           Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the “Contractual Currency”). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of
this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess.


(b)           Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid
in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. The term “rate of exchange” includes, without limitation, any premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency.


(c)           Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.
 
(d)           Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an actual exchange or purchase been made.

(b)           Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system.
 
(c)           Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii), the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction.

(i) This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.


(ii) The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a Confirmation.


(f)            No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.


(g)           Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.
 




10.


Offices; Multibranch Parties



 
(a)           If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or home office. This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.


(b)           Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior written consent of the other party.


(c)           If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.



11.           Expenses



A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including legal fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document

13.


Governing Law and Jurisdiction



 
(a)           Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule.


(b)           Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this Agreement (“Proceedings”), each party irrevocably:—


(i)        submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and


(ii)       waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.


Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, the Contracting States, as defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of Proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.
 
(c)           Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent (if any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any
 

ISDA® 1992

reason any party’s Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the other party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.



(d)           Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

“Loss” means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).

precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have

been required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would be subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in good faith by the party
obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.

“Relevant Jurisdiction” means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in which the party is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this Agreement and (d) in relation to any payment, from or through which such payment is made.
 
“Scheduled Payment Date” means a date on which a payment or delivery is to be made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction.

(a)           the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and
 
(b)          such party’s Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a commercially reasonable result.

of such Other Currency with the Termination Currency at or about 11:00 a.m. (in the city in which such foreign exchange agent is located) on such date as would be customary for the determination of such a rate for the purchase of such Other Currency for value on the relevant Early Termination Date or that later date. The foreign exchange agent will, if only one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties.

See “Description of the Mortgage Pool—Additional Mortgage Loan Information” in the Prospectus Supplement.


  
  
  
  

  

(1)


For Mortgage Loans that currently require only payments of interest but begin to amortize prior to Stated Maturity Date.


  
  
  
  

  

(2)


The prepayment provisions described in this Mortgage Loan Schedule are a general summary of the provisions of a mortgage loan that restrict the ability of the related borrower to voluntarily prepay the mortgage loan. In each case, some exceptions may apply that are not described in the general summary, such as provisions that permit a voluntary partial prepayment in connection with the release of a portion of a Mortgaged Property, or require the application of tenant holdback reserves to a partial prepayment, in each case notwithstanding any Lock-out Period or Yield Maintenance Charge that may otherwise apply.  In describing Prepayment Provisions, we use the following symbols with the indicated meanings:


  
  
  
  

  
  

●


“D(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which voluntary prepayments of principal are prohibited, but the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property.


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“L(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which voluntary prepayments of principal are prohibited and defeasance is not permitted.


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“O(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which prepayments of principal are permitted without the payment of any Prepayment Premium or Yield Maintenance Charge and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“YM(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“D or @%(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property or during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of a Prepayment Premium (equal to @% of the prepaid amount).


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“D or YM(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property and during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of a Yield Maintenance Charge and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“GRTR of @% or YM(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of the greater of a Yield Maintenance Charge and a Prepayment Premium (equal to @% of the prepaid amount) and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.


  
  
  
  

  
  


●



“D or GRTR of @% or YM(#)” means, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, a specified number of monthly payment periods (which number is denoted by a numeric value #) during which the related borrower is permitted to defease that Mortgage Loan in order to obtain a release of the related Mortgaged Property and during which prepayments of principal are permitted with the payment of the greater of a Yield Maintenance Charge and a Prepayment Premium (equal to @% of the prepaid amount) and the lender is not entitled to require a defeasance in lieu of prepayment.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
