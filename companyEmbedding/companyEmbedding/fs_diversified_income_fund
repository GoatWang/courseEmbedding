Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.

         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.

         A CD ladder, depending on the types and amount of securities within it, may not ensure adequate diversification of your investment portfolio. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, a lack of diversification may result in heightened volatility of your portfolio value. You must perform your own evaluation as to whether a CD ladder and the securities held within it are consistent with your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. To learn more about diversification and its effects on your portfolio, contact a representative.
	
      



         The CD ladder strategies displayed are provided for educational purposes and are not intended to serve as the primary basis for your investment, financial or tax planning decisions.
	
      



         Displayed rates of return, including Annual Percentage Yield (APY), represent stated APY for either individual Certificates of Deposit (CDs), or multiple CDs within model CD ladders, were identified from Fidelity inventory as of the time stated. For current inventory, including available CDs, please view the CDs & Ladders tab.
	
      



         The CDs in the CD Search Results screen are displayed on the basis of them offering the highest yields available given certain selected criteria. The criteria entered are at the sole discretion of the user, including the maturities of the strategy selected and yield-based inventory filtering, and any information obtained should not be considered an offer to buy or sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any securities.

         Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are debt instruments offered by commercial banks, thrifts and brokerages to raise funds for their business activities. Minimum investment amount is typically one CD or multiple CDs for a ladder strategy. All brokered CDs displayed are FDIC-insured as indicated by the Attribute: FDIC. The FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per institution per category of account, or up to $250,000 in qualifying retirement accounts. Note that FDIC insurance only covers the principal amount of the CD and any accrued interest. In some instances, CD's may be purchased on the secondary market at a price which reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance.

         1. The secondary market may be limited. The pre-maturity sale price of CDs may be less than its original purchase price, particularly if interest rates are higher at the time of sale. There may be certain features or provisions of the CD that may also influence its market price. If you want to buy or sell a CD, Fidelity Brokered Services LLC ("FBS") may charge you a fee. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the BondDesk platform, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         2. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Your ability to sell a CD on the secondary market is subject to market conditions. If your CD has a step rate, the interest rate of your CD may be higher or lower than prevailing market rates. The initial rate on a step rate CD is not the yield to maturity. If your CD has a call provision, which many step rate CDs do, please be aware the decision to call the CD is at the issuer’s sole discretion. Also, if the issuer calls the CD, you may be confronted with a less favorable interest rate at which to reinvest your funds. Fidelity makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution.
	
      



         3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the account holder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
      



         4. Fidelity makes new issue CDs available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC and National Financial Services LLC receive compensation for participating in the offering as a selling group member or underwriter.
	
      



         5. Other concessions apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

         The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Please see the ratings tab for more information about methodology. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

Rates are for U.S. dollar–denominated bonds; additional fees and minimums apply for non-dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply; see Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may affect the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.




         If you want to buy or sell a CD on the secondary market, Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS") will charge you a concession. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the Tradeweb Markets, TMC Bonds, and Knight Capital Group platforms, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.

         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
      



         ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Overview






Fund Overview
Higher income and growth potential from multiple global bond sectors
Investing across credit and emerging market bond sectors, PIMCO Diversified Income Fund can serve as a risk-managed, income-oriented complement to traditional core bond holdings.
Why Invest In This Fund
Enhanced income potential
The fund can take advantage of a global opportunity set, focusing on bond sectors that may provide an incremental yield advantage over developed market government bonds. These sectors include primarily investment grade corporate, high yield and emerging market bonds, as well as other credit sectors appearing to offer relative value.
A dynamic, flexible approach
The fund’s management team has the flexibility to adjust the fund’s sector weightings in response to changing market and economic conditions. This dynamic approach can allow the fund to both be defensive and take advantage of compelling income opportunities across regions and credit qualities.
Strong risk-adjusted returns
Sector allocations are guided by PIMCO’s forward-looking global outlook, favoring what we believe are the most attractive return opportunities while limiting exposure to sectors offering less compelling relative value or more downside risk. Over time, our diversified approach has resulted in attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Our Expertise
PIMCO has managed credit portfolios for more than 40 years, supported by 50-plus credit analysts based in nine different global offices. This broad investment platform enables us to uncover the best relative value opportunities globally.

The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Credit ex Emerging Markets (USD Hedged) provides a broad-based measure of the global developed markets investment-grade fixed income markets. The BofA Merrill Lynch BB-B Rated Developed Markets High Yield Constrained Index (USD Hedged) tracks the performance of below investment grade bonds of corporate issuers domiciled in developed market countries rated BB1 through B3, based on an average of Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Qualifying bonds are capitalization-weighted provided the total allocation to an individual issuer (defined by Bloomberg tickers) does not exceed 2%. Issuers that exceed the limit are reduced to 2% and the face value of each of their bonds is adjusted on a pro-rata basis. Similarly, the face value of bonds of all other issuers that fall below the 2% cap are increased on a pro-rata basis. The index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month. The JPMorgan EMBI Global (USD Hedged) tracks total returns for U.S. dollar-denominated debt instruments issued by emerging market sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities, Brady bonds, loans, Eurobonds and local market instruments.  It is not possible to invest in an unmanaged index.

Performance quoted represents past performance and is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
5The Sharpe Ratio measures the risk-adjusted performance. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the rate of return for a portfolio and the result is divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
6The information ratio is defined as the portfolio's excess return per unit of risk, or tracking error. For example, an information ratio of 1 means that a portfolio manager generates 100 basis points, or one percent of excess return for every 100 basis points of risk taken.
7Tracking error, a measure of risk, is defined as the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return vs. the benchmark expressed in percent.
8May include nominal and inflation-protected Treasuries, Treasury futures and options, agencies, FDIC-guaranteed and government-guaranteed corporate securities, and interest rate swaps.
9Short duration emerging markets instruments includes an emerging market security or other instrument economically tied to an emerging market country by country of risk with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or if unrated, determined to be similar quality by PIMCO. Emerging Markets includes the value of short duration emerging markets instruments previously reported in another category.
10May include municipals, convertibles, preferreds, and yankee bonds.
11Net Other Short Duration Instruments includes securities and other instruments (except instruments tied to emerging markets by country of risk) with an effective duration less than one year and rated investment grade or higher or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality, commingled liquidity funds, uninvested cash, interest receivables, net unsettled trades, broker money, short duration derivatives (for example Eurodollar futures) and derivatives offsets. With respect to certain categories of short duration securities, the Adviser reserves the discretion to require a minimum credit rating higher than investment grade for inclusion in this category. Derivatives Offsets includes offsets associated with investments in futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such offsets may be taken at the notional value of the derivative position which in certain instances may exceed the actual amount owed on such positions.

             Portfolio information in the charts is based on the fund's net assets. These percentages may differ from those used for the fund's compliance calculations, including the fund's prospectus, regulatory, and other investment limitations and policies, which may be based on total assets of the fund or other measurements, may include or exclude various categories of investments from those covered in the portfolio allocation categories shown in this report, and may be based on different classifications and measurements of the fund’s investments and other criteria.

             Duration is a measure of a portfolio’s price sensitivity expressed in years. Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.

Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:

 
Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed.The strategy may invest all of its assets in high-yield, lower-rated, securities which involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets.  Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not ensure against loss.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.
