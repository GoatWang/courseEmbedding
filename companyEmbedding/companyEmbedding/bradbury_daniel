Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1853 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: New York: Mason Bros. 360 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 453642876

Bradbery then chose Shelton and remained on his team. At the Battle rounds, Bradbery faced Caroline Glaser where they sang the song "Put Your Records On", Bradbery was chosen over Glaser, in the process advanced to the Knockout rounds. During the Knockouts, Bradbery sang "Jesus Take The Wheel" against Taylor Beckham in which Blake selected her to remain in the competition, sending home Beckham. During the Top 16 show, she sang "Maybe It Was Memphis" and was voted through by America into the next week. The following week, the country singer sang a rendition of Carrie Underwood's song "Wasted." During the Top 10 playoffs, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Heads Carolina, Tails California", which became the first song of the season, and only song of that round, to reach the iTunes top 10 charts.[5]
During the Top 8, Bradbery sang a soulful rendition of "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)." In the Top 6, she sang Pam Tillis' "Shake the Sugar Tree" chosen by coach Blake Shelton. That week, she also sang a powerhouse rendition of Sara Evans' "A Little Bit Stronger," ending the song with a high note through the final "stronger" and "yeah" run. During the Top 5, Bradbery sang "Please Remember Me" and "Who I Am" which reached 6 and 4 spots respectively on the iTunes top 10 charts. During "Who I Am," she walked out through the audience to sing beside her proud mom, dad, and stepmom.[5] At the finals, Bradbery sang the song "Timber, I'm Falling In Love" along with her coach Blake Shelton, she also re-sang the song "Maybe It Was Memphis" which would this time reach the iTunes top 10 charts and sang the song "Born to Fly" then she was announced as the winner of season four of The Voice.[5] She had the most peak positions and most singles to reach the top 10 on iTunes during the season.

The Voice[edit]
Main article: The Voice (U.S. season 4)
At the blind auditions on March 25, 2013, Bradbery performed Taylor Swift's "Mean", prompting Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Usher to turn their chairs. Bradbery then chose Shelton and remained on his team. At the Battle rounds, Bradbery faced Caroline Glaser where they sang the song "Put Your Records On", Bradbery was chosen over Glaser, in the process advanced to the Knockout rounds. During the Knockouts, Bradbery sang "Jesus Take The Wheel" against Taylor Beckham in which Blake selected her to remain in the competition, sending home Beckham. During the Top 16 show, she sang "Maybe It Was Memphis" and was voted through by America into the next week. The following week, the country singer sang a rendition of Carrie Underwood's song "Wasted." During the Top 10 playoffs, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Heads Carolina, Tails California", which became the first song of the season, and only song of that round, to reach the iTunes top 10 charts.[5]
During the Top 8, Bradbery sang a soulful rendition of "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)." In the Top 6, she sang Pam Tillis' "Shake the Sugar Tree" chosen by coach Blake Shelton. That week, she also sang a powerhouse rendition of Sara Evans' "A Little Bit Stronger," ending the song with a high note through the final "stronger" and "yeah" run. During the Top 5, Bradbery sang "Please Remember Me" and "Who I Am" which reached 6 and 4 spots respectively on the iTunes top 10 charts. During "Who I Am," she walked out through the audience to sing beside her proud mom, dad, and stepmom.[5] At the finals, Bradbery sang the song "Timber, I'm Falling In Love" along with her coach Blake Shelton, she also re-sang the song "Maybe It Was Memphis" which would this time reach the iTunes top 10 charts and sang the song "Born to Fly" then she was announced as the winner of season four of The Voice.[5] She had the most peak positions and most singles to reach the top 10 on iTunes during the season. Overall, she had more iTunes downloads than any other contestant in the show's history. At age 17, Bradbery was the youngest winner of The Voice.[6]

During the Knockouts, Bradbery sang "Jesus Take The Wheel" against Taylor Beckham in which Blake selected her to remain in the competition, sending home Beckham. During the Top 16 show, she sang "Maybe It Was Memphis" and was voted through by America into the next week. The following week, the country singer sang a rendition of Carrie Underwood's song "Wasted." During the Top 10 playoffs, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Heads Carolina, Tails California", which became the first song of the season, and only song of that round, to reach the iTunes top 10 charts.[5]

That week, she also sang a powerhouse rendition of Sara Evans' "A Little Bit Stronger," ending the song with a high note through the final "stronger" and "yeah" run. During the Top 5, Bradbery sang "Please Remember Me" and "Who I Am" which reached 6 and 4 spots respectively on the iTunes top 10 charts. During "Who I Am," she walked out through the audience to sing beside her proud mom, dad, and stepmom.[5] At the finals, Bradbery sang the song "Timber, I'm Falling In Love" along with her coach Blake Shelton, she also re-sang the song "Maybe It Was Memphis" which would this time reach the iTunes top 10 charts and sang the song "Born to Fly" then she was announced as the winner of season four of The Voice.[5] She had the most peak positions and most singles to reach the top 10 on iTunes during the season.

During the Knockouts, Bradbery sang "Jesus Take The Wheel" against Taylor Beckham in which Blake selected her to remain in the competition, sending home Beckham. During the Top 16 show, she sang "Maybe It Was Memphis" and was voted through by America into the next week. The following week, the country singer sang a rendition of Carrie Underwood's song "Wasted." During the Top 10 playoffs, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Heads Carolina, Tails California", which became the first song of the season, and only song of that round, to reach the iTunes top 10 charts.[5]
During the Top 8, Bradbery sang a soulful rendition of "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)." In the Top 6, she sang Pam Tillis' "Shake the Sugar Tree" chosen by coach Blake Shelton. That week, she also sang a powerhouse rendition of Sara Evans' "A Little Bit Stronger," ending the song with a high note through the final "stronger" and "yeah" run. During the Top 5, Bradbery sang "Please Remember Me" and "Who I Am" which reached 6 and 4 spots respectively on the iTunes top 10 charts. During "Who I Am," she walked out through the audience to sing beside her proud mom, dad, and stepmom.[5] At the finals, Bradbery sang the song "Timber, I'm Falling In Love" along with her coach Blake Shelton, she also re-sang the song "Maybe It Was Memphis" which would this time reach the iTunes top 10 charts and sang the song "Born to Fly" then she was announced as the winner of season four of The Voice.[5] She had the most peak positions and most singles to reach the top 10 on iTunes during the season.

Main article: The Voice (U.S. season 4)
At the blind auditions on March 25, 2013, Bradbery performed Taylor Swift's "Mean", prompting Adam Levine, Blake Shelton, and Usher to turn their chairs. Bradbery then chose Shelton and remained on his team. At the Battle rounds, Bradbery faced Caroline Glaser where they sang the song "Put Your Records On", Bradbery was chosen over Glaser, in the process advanced to the Knockout rounds. During the Knockouts, Bradbery sang "Jesus Take The Wheel" against Taylor Beckham in which Blake selected her to remain in the competition, sending home Beckham. During the Top 16 show, she sang "Maybe It Was Memphis" and was voted through by America into the next week. The following week, the country singer sang a rendition of Carrie Underwood's song "Wasted." During the Top 10 playoffs, Bradbery sang a rendition of "Heads Carolina, Tails California", which became the first song of the season, and only song of that round, to reach the iTunes top 10 charts.[5]
During the Top 8, Bradbery sang a soulful rendition of "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Ol' Days)." In the Top 6, she sang Pam Tillis' "Shake the Sugar Tree" chosen by coach Blake Shelton. That week, she also sang a powerhouse rendition of Sara Evans' "A Little Bit Stronger," ending the song with a high note through the final "stronger" and "yeah" run. During the Top 5, Bradbery sang "Please Remember Me" and "Who I Am" which reached 6 and 4 spots respectively on the iTunes top 10 charts. During "Who I Am," she walked out through the audience to sing beside her proud mom, dad, and stepmom.[5] At the finals, Bradbery sang the song "Timber, I'm Falling In Love" along with her coach Blake Shelton, she also re-sang the song "Maybe It Was Memphis" which would this time reach the iTunes top 10 charts and sang the song "Born to Fly" then she was announced as the winner of season four of The Voice.[5] She had the most peak positions and most singles to reach the top 10 on iTunes during the season. Overall, she had more iTunes downloads than any other contestant in the show's history. At age 17, Bradbery was the youngest winner of The Voice.[6]

more about Dan





The reason why I’m so committed to helping fellow business owners with these strategies is because in 2012 I was in a near fatal cycling accident. During an ironman race I hit a tree at full-speed head-first and suffered temporary brain damage. Even after my coma that lasted about a week, I wasn’t capable of running my own business for months; but because I had already put into place the strategies I now share with others, my company was able to manage itself and continue to thrive… that’s when it hit me that every business owner needs to have these systems in place.
If you speak with my clients they will tell you they walk away feeling I was the best return on investment they’ve ever made. because they feel more enthused and clear about the direction of their business than they have in years.
