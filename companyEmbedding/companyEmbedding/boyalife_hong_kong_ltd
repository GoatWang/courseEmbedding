A distribution agreement is a contract between a product manufacturer and a distributor who will sell and/or distribute a product. The agreement may outline the price per item the distributor pays for each item and the quantity per item, plus information regarding the distribution fee the manufacturer may pay.  Distribution agreements usually include details regarding territories and specific geographic areas in which the distributor may sell the product.These contracts are formed to protect both interests of the parties, and create a foundation for the business relationship. The manufacturer may demand a certain quota must be met, and if so, the quota information will be included in the contract. Other information that may be present within the contract can include the beginning end and dates of the distribution, options for renewal, warranties and release from claims.There may be language concerning subcontractors, if the distributor anticipates a need to hire additional help. The distributor may be involved in marketing, and if so, the contract will contain clauses regarding marketing rights. To protect their intellectual copyright and market value, the manufacturer may require confidentiality and non compete clauses in the contract. A distribution agreement may also include the rights to termination if either party fails to meet their contractual obligations.
