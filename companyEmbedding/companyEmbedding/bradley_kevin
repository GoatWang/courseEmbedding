But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in CA, I'd be happy to help.Learn More 5 Tips for Insurance Shopping OnlineThe choices you make when selecting insurance coverages, limits and deductibles can affect what you'll pay for a policy. Learn about what to expect when you're shopping for car insurance online.Learn More Comparing Renters Insurance QuotesWhen comparing renters insurance quotes from different insurers, it's important to take more than price into consideration. Understanding what the policy covers and making sure it fits your needs may help give you the peace of mind that comes from knowing you have certain protections in place while you're living in a rented home or apartment.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater. Start here for some helpful information on selecting or changing your beneficiary.Learn More Small Business Insurance NeedsYou know the ins and outs of your small business and what it takes to keep things running. But do you know how to help protect the business you've worked so hard to build? From merchandise to machinery to a home-based operation, there are a lot of coverage options available to choose from. This quick rundown of things you'll want to consider when insuring your small business is a great place to start. I know the effort a small business takes, and I'm here to help you protect your life's work.Learn More Is a Wedding Covered by Event Insurance?Considerable investments of time and money can go into planning a wedding.

You've invested your time in it, you've made sure it's in perfect working order and you took classes and bought the right gear so you could enjoy it safely. It only make sense that you put the same effort into safeguarding your bike, and you, with insurance. Whether it's collision coverage or a custom paint job, it's important to make sure you have the protection that fits your bike. Here's a breakdown of coverages to help you decide what is right for you.Learn More Motorhome Insurance BasicsIf you own a motorhome or are thinking about purchasing one, here are some things you may want to consider when it comes to protecting your home on wheels.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect. Take a look at this overview of condominium insurance, and then let's make sure you have the coverage you need.Learn More What's Umbrella Insurance?You have insurance to help protect your home and car, but what happens in situations where your standard insurance coverage is not enough? That's when a personal umbrella insurance policy (PUP) could help. If you're found legally responsible for damages resulting from an accident or if you're sued, a PUP may help prevent you from paying out of pocket for costs that exceed the limits of your homeowners or auto insurance. A PUP from Allstate may help cover attorney costs and lost wages, even if you're out of the country. If you're interested in increasing your protection, I'd be happy to talk to you about umbrella coverage today.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it.

Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Fortuna.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you.

        Synthesis and Enzymology of 2'-Deoxy-7-deazaisoguanosine Triphosphate and Its Complement: A Second Generation Pair in an Artificially Expanded Genetic Information System        
    Karalkar NB, Leal NA, Kim MS, Bradley KM, Benner SA    
ACS Synthetic Biology
                , American Chemical Society        (2016)    doi: 10.1021/acssynbio.5b00276 
<Abstract>


    As with natural nucleic acids, pairing between artificial nucleotides can be influenced by tautomerism, with different placements of protons on the heterocyclic nucleobase changing patterns of hydrogen bonding that determine replication fidelity. For example, the major tautomer of isoguanine presents a hydrogen bonding donor-donor-acceptor pattern complementary to the acceptor-acceptor-donor pattern of 5-methylisocytosine. However, in its minor tautomer, isoguanine presents a hydrogen bond donor-acceptor-donor pattern complementary to thymine. Calculations, crystallography, and physical organic experiments suggest that this tautomeric ambiguity might be "fixed" by replacing the N-7 nitrogen of isoguanine by a CH unit. To test this hypothesis, we prepared the triphosphate of 2'-deoxy-7-deazaiso-guanosine and used it in PCR to estimate an effective tautomeric ratio "seen" by Taq DNA polymerase. With 7-deazaisoguanine, fidelity-per-round was ~92%. The analogous PCR with isoguanine gave a lower fidelity-per-round of ~86%. These results confirm the hypothesis with polymerases, and deepen our understanding of the role of minor groove hydrogen bonding and proton tautomerism in both natural and expanded genetic "alphabets", major targets in synthetic biology.

<Abstract>


    Laboratory in vitro evolution (LIVE) might deliver
DNA aptamers that bind proteins expressed on the surface of
cells. In this work, we used cell engineering to place glypican 3
(GPC3), a possible marker for liver cancer theranostics, on the
surface of a liver cell line. Libraries were then built from a sixletter
genetic alphabet containing the standard nucleobases and
two added nucleobases (2-amino-8H-imidazo[1,2-a]-
[1,3,5]triazin-4-one and 6-amino-5-nitropyridin-2-one),
Watson-Crick complements from an artificially expanded
genetic information system (AEGIS). With counterselection
against non-engineered cells, eight AEGIS-containing aptamers
were recovered. Five bound selectively to GPC3-overexpressing
cells. This selectionâ€“counterselection scheme had
acceptable statistics, notwithstanding the possibility that cells
engineered to overexpress GPC3 might also express different
off-target proteins. This is the first example of such a combination.  





        Standard and AEGIS nicking molecular beacons detect amplicons from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

<Abstract>


    This paper combines two advances to detect MERS-CoV, the causative agent of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, that have emerged over the past few years from the new field of "synthetic biology". Both are based on an older concept, where molecular beacons are used as the downstream detection of viral RNA in biological mixtures followed by reverse transcription PCR amplification. The first advance exploits the artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS). AEGIS adds nucleotides to the four found in standard DNA and RNA (xNA); AEGIS nucleotides pair orthogonally to the A:T and G:C pairs. Placing AEGIS components in the stems of molecular beacons is shown to lower noise by preventing unwanted stem invasion by adventitious natural xNA. This should improve the signal-to-noise ratio of molecular beacons operating in complex biological mixtures. The second advance introduces a nicking enzyme that allows a single target molecule to activate more than one beacon, allowing "signal amplification". Combining these technologies in primers with components of a self-avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS), we detect 50 copies of MERS-CoV RNA in a multiplexed respiratory virus panel by generating fluorescence signal visible to human eye and/or camera.  





        A norovirus detection architecture based on isothermal amplification and expanded genetic systems

<Abstract>


    Noroviruses are the major cause of global viral gastroenteritis with short incubation times and small inoculums required for infection. This creates a need for a rapid molecular test for norovirus for early diagnosis, in the hope of preventing the spread of the disease. Non-chemists generally use off-the shelf reagents and natural DNA to create such tests, suffering from background noise that comes from adventitious DNA and RNA (collectively xNA) that is abundant in real biological samples, especially feces, a common location for norovirus. Here, we create an assay that combines artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS, which adds nucleotides to the four in standard xNA, pairing orthogonally to A:T and G:C) with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to amplify norovirus RNA at constant temperatures, without the power or instrument requirements of PCR cycling. This assay was then validated using feces contaminated with murine norovirus (MNV). Treating stool samples with ammonia extracts the MNV RNA, which is then amplified in an AEGIS-RT-LAMP where AEGIS segments are incorporated both into an internal LAMP primer and into a molecular beacon stem, the second lowering background signaling noise. This is coupled with RNase H nicking during sample amplification, allowing detection of as few as 10 copies of noroviral RNA in a stool sample, generating a fluorescent signal visible to human eye, all in a closed reaction vessel.

<Abstract>


    Reported here is a laboratory in vitro evolution (LIVE)
experiment based on an artificially expanded genetic
information system (AEGIS). This experiment delivers
the first example of an AEGIS aptamer that binds
to an isolated protein target, the first whose structural
contact with its target has been outlined and
the first to inhibit biologically important activities of
its target, the protective antigen from Bacillus anthracis.
We show how rational design based on secondary
structure predictions can also direct the use
of AEGIS to improve the stability and binding of the
aptamer to its target. The final aptamer has a dissociation
constant of ~35 nM. These results illustrate
the value of AEGIS-LIVE for those seeking to
obtain receptors and ligands without the complexities
of medicinal chemistry, and also challenge the
biophysical community to develop new tools to analyze
the spectroscopic signatures of new DNA folds
that will emerge in synthetic genetic systems replacing
standard DNA and RNA as platforms for LIVE.

<Abstract>


    Axiomatically, the density of information
stored in DNA, with just four nucleotides (GACT), is
higher than in a binary code, but less than it might be if
synthetic biologists succeed in adding independently
replicating nucleotides to genetic systems. Such addition
could also add additional functional groups, not found in
natural DNA but useful for molecular performance. Here,
we consider two new nucleotides (Z and P, 6-amino-5-
nitro-3-(1'-B-D-2'-deoxyribo-furanosyl)-2(1H)-pyridone
and 2-amino-8-(1'-B-D-2'-deoxyribofuranosyl)-imidazo-
[1,2-a]-1,3,5-triazin-4(8H)-one). These are designed to
pair via strict Watson?Crick geometry. These were added
to a laboratory in vitro evolution (LIVE) experiment; the
GACTZP library was challenged to deliver molecules that
bind selectively to liver cancer cells, but not to
untransformed liver cells. Unlike in classical in vitro
selection systems, low levels of mutation allow this system
to evolve to create binding molecules not necessarily
present in the original library. Over a dozen binding
species were recovered. The best had Z and/or P in their
sequences. Several had multiple, nearby, and adjacent Zs
and Ps. Only the weaker binders contained no Z or P at all.
This suggests that this system explored much of the
sequence space available to this genetic system and that
GACTZP libraries are richer reservoirs of functionality
than standard libraries.  





        Detecting respiratory viral RNA using expanded genetic alphabets and
self-avoiding DNA

<Abstract>


    Nucleic acid (NA)-targeted tests detect and quantify viral DNA and RNA (collectively xNA) to support
epidemiological surveillance and, in individual patients, to guide therapy. They commonly use polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR. Although these all have rapid turnaround,
they are expensive to run. Multiplexing would allow their cost to be spread over multiple targets, but
often only with lower sensitivity and accuracy, noise, false positives, and false negatives; these arise by
interactions between the multiple nucleic acid primers and probes in a multiplexed kit. Here we offer a
multiplexed assay for a panel of respiratory viruses that mitigates these problems by combining several
nucleic acid analogs from the emerging field of synthetic biology: (i) self-avoiding molecular recognition
systems (SAMRSs), which facilitate multiplexing, and (ii) artificially expanded genetic information systems
(AEGISs), which enable low-noise PCR. These are supplemented by "transliteration" technology,
which converts standard nucleotides in a target to AEGIS nucleotides in a product, improving hybridization. The combination supports a multiplexed Luminex-based respiratory panel that potentially differentiates influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, detecting as few as 10
MERS virions in a 20-ml sample.  





        High-throughput multiplexed xMAP Luminex array panel for
detection of twenty two medically important mosquito-borne

<Abstract>


    Mosquito-borne arboviruses are emerging world-wide as important human and animal pathogens. This
makes assays for their accurate and rapid identification essential for public health, epidemiological, ecological
studies. Over the past decade, many mono- and multiplexed assays targeting arboviruses nucleic
acids have been reported. None has become established for the routine identification of multiple viruses
in a "single tube" setting. With increasing multiplexing, the detection of viral RNAs is complicated by
noise, false positives and negatives. In this study, an assay was developed that avoids these problems
by combining two new kinds of nucleic acids emerging from the field of synthetic biology. The first is a
"self-avoiding molecular recognition system" (SAMRS), which enables high levels of multiplexing. The
second is an "artificially expanded genetic information system" (AEGIS), which enables clean PCR amplification
in nested PCR formats. A conversion technology was used to place AEGIS component into amplicon,
improving their efficiency of hybridization on Luminex beads. When Luminex "liquid microarrays" are
exploited for downstream detection, this combination supports single-tube PCR amplification assays that
can identify 22 mosquito-borne RNA viruses from the genera Flavivirus, Alphavirus, Orthobunyavirus. The
assay differentiates between closely-related viruses, as dengue, West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and the
California serological group. The performance and the sensitivity of the assay were evaluated with dengue
viruses and infected mosquitoes; as few as 6-10 dengue virions can be detected in a single mosquito.  





        Helicase Dependent Isothermal Amplification of DNA and RNA using Self-Avoiding Molecular Recognition Systems

<Abstract>


    Assays that target DNA or RNA (xNA) are highly sensitive, as small amounts of xNA can be amplified by PCR. Unfortunately, PCR is inconvenient in low resource environments, requiring equipment and power that may not be available in these environments. However, isothermal procedures that avoid thermal cycling are often confounded by primer dimers, off-target priming, and other artifacts. Here, we show how a "self avoiding molecular recognition system" (SAMRS) eliminates these artifacts to give clean amplicons in a helicase-dependent isothermal amplification (SAMRS-HDA). We also show that incorporating SAMRS into the 3'-ends of primers facilitates the design and screening of primers for HDA assays. Finally, we show that SAMRS-HDA can be twofold multiplexed, something difficult to achieve with HDA using standard primers. This shows that SAMRS-HDA is a more versatile approach than standard HDA with a broader applicability for xNA-targeted diagnostics and research.  





OligArch: A software tool to allow artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS) to guide the autonomous self-assembly of long DNA constructs from multiple DNA single strands

Beilstein J. Org. Chem.
                , Beilstein Institute        (2014)    10, 1826-1833, doi:10.3762/bjoc.10.192 
<Abstract>


    Synthetic biologists wishing to self-assemble large DNA (L-DNA) constructs from small DNA fragments made by automated synthesis need fragments that hybridize predictably. Such predictability is difficult to obtain with nucleotides built from just the four standard nucleotides. Natural DNA's peculiar combination of strong and weak G:C and A:T pairs, the context-dependence of the strengths of those pairs, unimolecular strand folding that competes with desired interstrand hybridization, and non-Watson–Crick interactions available to standard DNA, all contribute to this unpredictability. In principle, adding extra nucleotides to the genetic alphabet can improve the predictability and reliability of autonomous DNA self-assembly, simply by increasing the information density of oligonucleotide sequences. These extra nucleotides are now available as parts of artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS), and tools are now available to generate entirely standard DNA from AEGIS DNA during PCR amplification. Here, we describe the OligArch (for "oligonucleotide architecting") software, an application that permits synthetic biologists to engineer optimally self-assembling DNA constructs from both six- and eight-letter AEGIS alphabets. This software has been used to design oligonucleotides that self-assemble to form complete genes from 20 or more single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides. OligArch is therefore a key element of a scalable and integrated infrastructure for the rapid and designed engineering of biology.

Illinois Poet Laureate - Kevin Stein

Welcome to Bradley University's Illinois Poet Laureate website. Here you'll find a broad array of poetry and poetry-related topics for your enjoyment. This site showcases Illinois poets of all ages, offering you selected text, audio, and video samplings of their fine works. You'll also learn about my various statewide laureate activities and see how those activities impact Bradley students as well as the larger Illinois community.
Over the years, Bradley has become a focal point for the study and promotion of Illinois poetry. Our students study the work of Illinois poets in the classroom, listen to Illinois poets read from their work within our Visiting Writers Series, and share their knowledge of Illinois poetry by working with area high school students. Illinois poetry is at the center of a lively dialogue here at Bradley. For instance, my own labors co-editing (with the late G. E. Murray) the Illinois Voices poetry anthology were greatly aided by Bradley students' input during several courses devoted to the subject.
Take a look at the Illinois Featured Poet page, the gallery of poetry recitations and performances, and the splendid gathering of Illinois Youth Poetry offered on the site. Also, don't miss the audio anthology Bread & Steel featuring twenty-four distinguished Illinois poets reciting their works and learn how my Poetry Now! project funds purchases of Illinois poetry by many of our state's public and school libraries. 
And, yes, you'll find a selection of my poetry and interviews here as well - including text, video, and audio presentations.
You're invited to return often to this site, as new work is added throughout the year. For a bevy of additional Illinois poetry offerings, please visit as well my state Poet Laureate's website at www.poetlaureate.il.gov.
Sincerely,
Kevin Stein Illinois Poet Laureate and Caterpillar Professor of English
