Bad News for World Acceptance Corp.: The State-by-State Loophole Business is Now Going Out of Business - Citron Research






















































 
 







 Bad News for World Acceptance Corp.: The State-by-State Loophole Business is Now Going Out of Business  Archived Reports, Citron Reports In May, Citron research introduced readers to the curious case of World Acceptance Corp.  (NASADAQ:WRLD) a sub-prime lender doing business in approximately 900 locations mostly located in the South.  Citron has been quiet as of late because 1.  markets have turned indiscriminately positive 2. We were waiting to assess the prospects for regulation of sub-prime lenders.
Neither a bank nor a payday lender, World has built its entire business on loopholes — and therefore its operating region is limited to just 11 states where its been able to curry the favor of state legislatures to open the loopholes in state usury laws so it can make sub-sub-sub-prime loans at super-high rates.  Any form of federal law, which has never existed, would supercede the many loopholes enabling WRLD to operate in their niche states.
We’re sure World’s shareholders have been sitting on the edge of their seats as lobbying organizations such as World’s own NILA (www.nilaonline.org) , along with an army of banking industry lobbyists, are toiling night and day in DC seeking ways to torpedo the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA).  And with good reason:  uniform Federal regulation by the CFPA would threaten World’s entire business model.  Refer to last week’s statement from the CFPA’s architect, Elizabeth Warren, the chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel overseeing the US banking bailout. http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=4454
“But there is an even bigger change in the wind: regulating the non-banks. Democrats and Republicans alike agree that the proliferation of unregulated, non-bank lenders contributed significantly to the financial crisis by feeding millions of dangerous financial products into the economic system. Non-bank institutions were active participants in the race to the bottom among lenders.
From sub-prime mortgage loans to small dollar loans, they showed how to wring high fees and staggering interest rates out of consumer lending. Their fine-print contracts, and new tricks and traps, transformed the market.”
A Turn of Events
Before today, the question was “Will there or won’t there be a CFPA? ”
Enter the Fed.  As of today, the only remaining question is not whether World will come under uniform Federal regulation, but only the inevitable:  how soon, and by whom? 


http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/15/AR2009091503311.html?hpid=sec-business 



“Lenders that are neither banks nor owned by holding companies remain beyond the reach of federal oversight. The Obama administration has proposed a single oversight framework for all lenders as part of its financial reform package.”
Everyone now realizes the need for uniform Federal regulation of consumer lending, and it has become inevitable.  The Fed, which has resisted the new CFPA initiative because of the potential overlap of its jurisdiction, doesn’t need new legislation to fire up its own operations — it’s given notice that it’s the new sheriff in town, effective today.  That step aligns all the parties — Congress, the Obama Administration and the Fed — in their intent : to protect the sub-prime consumer from predatory lending practices.
Citron notes that while a federal interest rate cap would put World completely out of business, it doesn’t expect this outcome in the near term.  And it won’t take a fixed interest rate cap to seriously impair World’s business.  A more likely outcome is prohibition of the most abusive practices of “flipping” and “packing” — which is more than enough to devastate World’s cash flow and viability.
So the question for World becomes:  who’s jurisdiction do you want, the Fed or the CFPA?  Either way, expect a set of regulations that eliminate the egregious differences between how states treat “cycle-of-debt” lending practices.  Citron believes that with its narrow business model (its entire business is one product:  a portfolio of low-dollar, paper-based, high-interest, frequently flipped consumer installment loans) it is now the single most vulnerable financial company in America to regulation which could derail its entire business, regardless of whether a CFPA is ever voted into law as a standalone agency…..but that is not where the story ends.
Something in the Books Smells Real Funky
As consumer credit has hit a 26 year low WRLD’s receivables book might lie in the graveyard with other non-collateralized sub-prime lenders.  Interest rates for World’s customers, who typically are not credit-worthy enough to qualify for conventional bank loans or might not even have a bank account, start at over 80% APR. However, by actively marketing the nefarious practice of “flipping”, (eg re-writing existing loans every time the customer is at risk of missing a payment), and “packing” (selling “credit insurance” of dubious value bundled as an extra fee with the loan) World jacks its effective yield — the take on its portfolio of loans outstanding — to over 100%, as reported in filings.
World claims it has sailed through the hurricane of the current financial crisis without even getting wet.  Its loan losses, a figure the company can pretty much set to whatever it wants in the short term, have barely moved from pre-crisis levels. On the last conference call, analyst after analyst inquired how this could be. Management’s answer was essentially that “Our customers are unique. They are more affected by the price of gas than credit distress, because essentially our customer is always economically distressed.”
It is the opinion of Citron Research that World’s story is reaching the breaking point. As detailed in the linked story below, credit quality is still in serious decline, and the states most impacted are World’s breadbasket. In fact World’s operations are so concentrated in this region, that four of the five most distressed states represent 45% of their US locations. 
http://moneyfeatures.blogs.money.cnn.com/2009/07/15/consumer-credit-crisis-no-sign-of-decline/
Unemployment, which sits at record levels, is hitting financially marginal consumers hardest.  While the rate of job losses has begun to slow, unemployment is still rising, and job creation – the real relief — has not even begun to surface. With unemployment closely correlated to credit distress, somehow investors are asked to believe World’s bottom-tier credit customers are immune to unemployment and underemployment, as well as gas prices that have doubled off their lows.
On their last conference call, World was asked repeatedly by analysts how in the face of these adverse conditions, it justifies lowered loan loss reserves. When asked about the increase in loans, and obviously reluctant to discuss its reliance on loan -flipping, management cited less competition from HFC and CitiFinance.
Citron has observed a pattern that small companies under scrutiny of short-sellers find “creative” and “unique” ways to make their numbers….temporarily.  In the case of World, we’re getting into the realm of the ridiculous.
We know that HFC exited the bottom-end consumer finance business in March of 2009 after confessing to a book of mounting losses, and CitiFinance put its book of bottom-end consumer finance business in its “bad bank”.  Yet World asks investors to believe its nearly $500 million book of uncollateralized and unsecured loans, at rates double to triple Citi’s or HFC’s, remains fully collectable.
Remember, World isn’t a bank – it won’t be receiving any government financial support – and investors won’t be receiving any warning notices from regulators about its financial vulnerabilities either.
It is the opinion of Citron Research that by serially flipping and re-writing loans 45 days delinquent, (a “service” which World discloses it “actively markets to its customers”) the company masks the true low quality of its receivables. Further, by its own admission, it also rewrote over $40 million in loans from its own “delinquent” status (beyond 45 days overdue).
Even states that aren’t actively rewriting laws to curb the abusive practices of WRLD and other installment lenders are actively establishing alternatives to extend credit to WRLD’s type of customer. (Note that World has more than twice as many locations in Texas than any other state.)
http://cityhallblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2009/08/bank-on-dallas-plan-would-targ.html
World Acceptance’s Dirty Little Secret.   We expect nothing less….

On the conference call, management stated, “if you look at individual branches, you see a wide disparity between the best and the worst”. Now Citron offers an explanation.  WRLD operates in the gray area of “non-payday” lending to the US military.  Just two years ago, the 2007 Military Authorization Act made it illegal to issue payday loans, car title loans, and tax refund anticipation loans with rates exceeding 36% to members of the US military or their families.
http://www.usmilitary.com/1502/military-financial-protection/
It is obvious that WRLD has sidestepped the spirit of the law by marketing and transacting installment loans at 80% + APR to military personnel (terms over 91 days get around the law) .
Here’s the face of World’s military lending in Killeen Texas:
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=World+Finance,&sll=31.128502,-97.735587&sspn=0.033393,0.035577&ie=UTF8&radius=1.05&rq=1&ll=31.121109,-97.727551&spn=0.015063,0.035577&z=15&layer=c&cbll=31.121097,-97.727553&panoid=-o-r4QTqd3R2N9defPavLg&cbp=11,102.66,,1,-6.38
Here is another one — one of their offices in Fort Campbell, Tenn.
http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=World+Finance,&sll=36.602161,-87.425508&sspn=0.050645,0.076561&ie=UTF8&radius=2.13&rq=1&layer=c&cbll=36.601904,-87.423191&panoid=2PcUodzGhf6R9DxkLpkEug&ll=36.601886,-87.423191&spn=0.025288,0.097075&z=14&cbp=11,224.75,,1,5
Consider the little town of Killeen Texas, home to Fort Hood, one of the largest Army bases in the US. WRLD has four offices located either within or bordering that small town.  Citron has confirmed the terms of these loans to our soldiers in Killeen.  If a soldier borrows only $675, he/she ends up paying an APR of over 100% and that is only on the unlikely chance that the borrower pays the loan off at maturity … rates will be higher if the loan is flipped, like nearly all of WRLD’s loans are (an average of 3 times each).
According to article 70 of the Warner Act, the military law applies to both service members and their dependents. It stipulates that the APR of a covered extension of credit cannot exceed 36% APR, and it mandates disclosures and terms mirroring the Truth in Lending Act. It also includes a provision against any state or federal preemption, unless those laws provide even greater protections.
Other provisions include the following prohibitions: (All of which WRLD participates in)

Lenders may not roll over, renew, refinance or consolidate credit unless the new transaction results in more favorable terms to the borrower.
Borrowers cannot be required or allowed to waive the right to legal recourse.
In the case of dispute, lenders cannot require the borrower to submit to arbitration or impose onerous legal notice provisions.

World finds military lending profitable because they can easily get their collection hooks into a soldier’s pay – by putting the loan on “allotment” (the military’s direct deposit system), or calling the soldier’s chain of command — a commonly used collection tactic.
It is Citron’s opinion that WRLD has intentionally grown its business of usury-rate lending to members of the US military. As soon as this loophole is closed, so go those “best offices”.  
Conclusion
Citron still believes that WRLD has got one foot on a banana peel and the other in the corporate graveyard, in which are buried every other sub-prime lender that thought they were one step ahead of the market.  We believe that management is facing too many potential landmines, including a new regulatory scheme intent on leveling the consumer debt field across all states.  If just one of those landmines blows, the true liabilities of its inflated portfolio of unsecured, uncollateralized receivables will be exposed.
World’s business window is narrowing in both time and geography.  While it waits for Federal regulation, it can’t meaningfully expand its eleven-state operations to any new states if it loses one or two.  It offers only one type of transaction — a paper-based installment loan — and has no presence in any form of electronic commerce, no debit cards, no ATM’s, etc.  As a source of growth, its Mexico initiative is obviously failing to generate profits or growth.  Citron believes its military lending business is at heightened risk of being shut down at any time, regardless of the Fed or CFPA.
As economic distress falls disproportionately on those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, Citron Research believes an increasing percentage of the loans on World’s books are in fact delinquent and noncollectable, masked by a corporate policy of serially flipping them whenever the borrower can’t pay.  Adding the inevitable federal regulation to close state-by-state loopholes, Citron concludes World’s options are dimming, and its entire business model is at severe risk.

	World Acceptance Corp. (WRLD) Will Be the CFPB’s Final Victim

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in very real danger of being dismantled by President-elect Donald Trump and Congress within the first 100 days of his presidency. As it is, a federal court found its structure unconstitutional. The CFPB is challenging the ruling, but if it stands, director Richard Cordray is likely to be bounced, at a minimum.
But before either he or his bureau is executed, you can bet he will add one last crowning achievement to his legacy: the wholesale destruction of an installment lender.
Getting to Know World Acceptance Corp. (WRLD)
World Acceptance Corp. (NASDAQ:WRLD) has been under investigation by the CFPB since March 2014, and on Aug. 7, 2015, it received a “NORA Letter” that indicates the CFPB intends to take legal action against the company.
Based on my extensive knowledge of World Acceptance Corp., I believe there are two main areas the CFPB is going to address, and they are cornerstones of WRLD and how it operates.
World Acceptance Corp. is an installment lender. Its average loan is $1,190 for 13 months with an average interest rate of 100% APR. However, it uses an obscure rule to calculate interest, called the “Rule of 78.” It charges 12/78ths of the interest due in the first month, 11/78ths the second month, and so on.
I believe the CFPB hates that 69.4% of World Acceptance Corp. loans are generated through refinancings of previous loans, for the same reason it hates the “debt treadmill” of payday loans. Because of the interest rate structure, WRLD is incentivized to refinance these loans early, because it collects more than 40% of total interest due in just the first three months of a loan.
Get a consumer to refinance early, roll them into a new loan, then start collecting heavily front-loaded interest on the refinanced loan.
Just as the CFPB issued rules designed to kill payday lending, which includes severe restrictions on rollovers, I believe the CFPB will issue similar rules designed to prevent World Acceptance Corp. from engaging in refinancing of any loans unless WRLD adheres to similar impossible-to-meet standards.
The other revenue scheme for World Acceptance Corp. has been to entice consumers into purchasing credit insurance for their loans, which is also financed. I direct you to Citron Research’s excellent analysis of the insurance product. The CFPB hates credit insurance, and the Citron report is accurate — the CFPB hit Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF) and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) with nine-figure fines for add-on products like credit insurance.
These two areas make up all of WRLD stock revenues, and I believe the CFPB will attack both of them in the very near future.
What Does This Mean for WRLD?
What might punitive action look like? I think it will be bad enough to force WRLD stock into liquidation.
I think the CFPB will kill the refinancing model that is the cornerstone of the company’s entire business. With that gone, insurance revenue goes away, too.
Yes, I really do think Cordray will do this. World Acceptance has received tremendous amounts of bad press, and what greater political swan song could the CFPB have than wiping out a bad player?
Here’s the liquidation scenario:

World Acceptance Corp. Will Be The Next Victim Of The Serial Lender Killer Known As The CFPB - World Acceptance Corporation (NASDAQ:WRLD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»World Acceptance Corp. Will Be The Next Victim Of The Serial Lender Killer Known As The CFPBSep. 9.15 | About: World Acceptance (WRLD) Overbet For Value Long/short equity, Deep Value, tech, long-term horizonSummaryWorld Acceptance's lenders are willing to forego profit potential because the odds of CFPB action against World Acceptance are high.Fines and restitution along with unfavorable rule changes to the installment loan industry are likely to cripple World Acceptance's prospects.The CFPB can do whatever it wants, and it wants to kill World Acceptance Corp.I have been following the World Acceptance (NASDAQ: WRLD) story for a few years. I have been long puts for the last few months. For the first few years of following this company, I had formed a generally positive view of the company's prospects. If I were to enter a position, I imagined I would be buying stock or calls. By any standard metric (P/E, EV/EBITDA, Price/FCF, etc.), the stock looked cheap. From FY2010 to FY2014, revenue, net profit and operating cash flow consistently ticked up. At the low valuations it received during that five year run, it looked too good to be true - and it was.
Whitney Tilson posted an interesting article making the short case for World Acceptance in September 2013. I thought his conclusion that CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) action is likely seemed to not be backed by a substantial amount of evidence. Tilson is far from the first to make a short case against World Acceptance focused on what some would call the company's unsavory business practices. Citron Research posted a scathing article about the company in 2009 that was similar in tone to Tilson's 2013 article. I considered most of the alleged violations against World Acceptance as merely potentially ethically questionable at worst and possibly nothing at all.
In March 2014, World Acceptance received a CID from the CFPB. I still did not think that this meant the potential demise of World Acceptance could happen anytime soon. Even if World Acceptance's business practices (absurdly high interest rates, selling useless insurance products, deceptive marketing practices, etc.) are in fact illegal (and I don't think they are), government agencies that could levy an enormous fine against the company or force the company to change some of its profitable practices are slow to act. After all, government agencies are not exactly known to be quick and efficient. I would expect the CFPB to be even slower and less efficient than a typical government agency given the makeup of its employee base.

Everything changed in late June of 2015. World Acceptance filed an 8-K that outlined a change in its debt covenants. Banks rarely take actions that lower its potential profitability. It goes against a bank's basic instincts to do so unless it has very good reason to believe financial distress is in the borrower's near future. There was a great article posted on Seeking Alpha in early July discussing an appropriate valuation of World Acceptance under various scenarios. The two basic scenarios are:

The CFPB unleashes its wrath on the company. The CFPB issues huge fines, demands restitution and changes rules in a manner that the business shuts down as there is very little hope of generating any future profits.
The change in the debt covenants (along with potential CFPB action) will bring a slow death to the company as its capital base deteriorates. The article then presents a potential value of the company in this scenario.

The basic valuation approach is estimating a probability that each scenario plays out and estimating the price per share under each scenario. The estimated fair value of World Acceptance is: P(Scenario 1) * E(Price per Share in Scenario 1) + P(Scenario 2) * E(Price per Share in Scenario 2). That's simple enough. I now believe P(Scenario 1) is now much greater than 50% and E(Price per Share in Scenario 1) is very close to 0. I initiated a bearish position on World Acceptance shortly after the change in debt covenants was presented in an 8-K filing, and the stock has fallen quite a bit since then. I believe that the stock is nowhere near its bottom in the mid-30s.
The stated goal of the CFPB is to protect consumers against the financial sector. This agency is the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, widely regarded as one of America's most anti-bank legislators. Throughout her career in Congress, she has consistently taken a position against any company resembling a bank.
Warren's appointment to lead the CFPB by President Obama was blocked by Congress. However, a close ally to Warren, Richard Cordray was eventually appointed as director of the CFPB in January 2012. In the capacity of director of the CFPB, Cordray seems to have the authority to serve as judge, jury and executioner in cases against companies involved with payday loans and installment loans. At this point, you might be asking what law World Acceptance has violated. I am asking that same question.

The interest rates and fees that World Acceptance charge are within the confines of state laws. Using the Rule of 78 to calculate interest is legal as long as the term of the loans is not more than five years. Selling insurance at a price significantly higher than what the product's fair market value is not illegal. Perhaps there are isolated incidents of predatory and illegal activity within World Acceptance, but I do not see evidence of significant clear misdeeds across the firm. Of course, what is considered predatory, deceptive and unfair is quite subjective.
The CFPB seems to be an exception to a system of government that was founded on the principle of checks and balances. The CFPB interprets laws quite liberally, and unsurprisingly, that interpretation seems to always go against lenders. The PHH Corporation is challenging the constitutionality of the CFPB. At least two other similar cases against the CFPB ended in decisions that sided with the anti-bank bureau. I believe it is highly likely that Cordray will lay down his interpretation of the law on World Acceptance. The CFPB will likely use some combination of fines, restitution to "victims" and rule changes that dictate how World Acceptance may operate. This is not a parking fine or a speeding ticket. The penalty will likely be big enough to send the equity value of World Acceptance to zero.
The question is no longer whether the CFPB will crush World Acceptance. The relevant question is when the CFPB will give its final ruling that serves as a death blow to World Acceptance. Given the possible change in the political environment in 2017 (when a new President takes over), I believe CFPB action will occur before then. This action will likely happen in late 2015. It is now a race between the CFPB and SEC to take down World Acceptance. However, I don't think the SEC investigation will materially impact World Acceptance as the CFPB is likely to kill World Acceptance on its own.
Almost 17 months passed between the day the CFPB issued a CID and the day it issued a NORA (Notice and Opportunity to Respond and Advise) letter to World Acceptance. Under normal circumstances, World Acceptance would have replied to the NORA letter within 2 weeks of receipt of it. That reply should have been sent out no later than August 21, 2015. Another 2 weeks have passed and the waiting game continues for the CFPB to act. It is almost inconceivable that World Acceptance could make an argument that could persuade the CFPB to believe its 17 month fact finding mission that resulted in the NORA letter missed important details that could dramatically sway the opinion of the CFPB.

The biggest concern I have for the short case for World Acceptance is the uncertainty in how long it will take before the CFPB acts. Government agencies tend to be inefficient, the CFPB probably more so than others, and that inefficiency is my biggest concern to the short thesis against World Acceptance as the possibility of the CFPB taking far longer than I expect to act is not immaterial. World Acceptance will likely not get fair treatment from the CFPB, and no one cares enough to intervene. For World Acceptance, the fate of its stock is likely a crash to zero.

            Learn about ConsumerAffairs for Brands!Consumer Complaints and ReviewsDr R of Oklahoma City, OK on May 30, 2017Satisfaction RatingReading some of these complaints make me wonder. First, the young lady that has a Protective Order against her ex, and he takes his girlfriend in with the young lady's car title, obtaining a loan and getting a lien against her car title. There were so many laws broke here, #1 is the ex's disregard for the court order thereby violating the injunction. #2 the ex's girlfriend committing fraud, identity theft and a number more. #3, the company only gave the young lady a lien release (to heck with this the company needed to go to DMV and undo what they done at their cost, not the young lady's cost). Finally, you have violations under the "Truth In Lending Laws" which are both state and federal violations. The company and its employee(s) are liable both criminally and civilly for what was done.Now, as for me being a customer, I am not totally happy, they are not as truthful about things as they should be. They only report to the credit bureaus every so often, they DO NOT report the correct balances which makes it look like you are not paying every month. Then when you question about their reporting (or lack thereof) they do a song and dance to cloud the fact they don't do what they say they will do for your credit score. But so far they are ok. I will agree that their interest rates are extremely high, but they are a high-risk lender.Helpful?YesNo!@#$ of Charlotte, NC on July 31, 2016Satisfaction RatingThey send out pre-approvals like toilet paper. I received several and responded when in need of some quick cash. Once they get your social security number they are slow and apathetic about responding. The poop face dude in Pineville told me he'd be calling within a couple hours. Never called. MAYBE HE DIED. Only this death would absolve his sin.Helpful?YesNoKatie of Midwest City, OK on Sept. 30, 2015Satisfaction RatingI got my loan Dec 2013 so I could give my kids a good Christmas. Well, I lost my Nov 2014 and couldn't make the payments for 3 months. When I finally got a job, they still serviced me court papers and I had to take time out of training to sit in a court room just so they could write that we had an agreement. So I lost time and training and was let go from that job. Now I have a new job but I broke my hand on the job and can't work a full 40 hour work week, so what I do make goes to bill and house payment. But they don't care, they say they will work with you but yet when it boils down to it they won't work with you.The manager and assistance manager are snobby and they make threats to turn it over to the courts when I know my brother and sister-in-law are behind on their loan from a different branch for over a year now and they still haven't turned them into the courts. But they sure as heck are quick to call family friends and my job that I don't work at anymore. Very quick to call people that I told to go to them for loans asking them about my personal business and when they won't tell them anything they get snobby with them. I told them already once I get caught up on bills and my rent payments 'cause my landlord is very nice and letting me make small payments to keep myself afloat. But they do not work with you and wish I knew who to contact that's over these woman. The other lady is very nice and understands situation so when I do call I try to make sure it's her I'm talking to. 'Cause the other two need to go to people skills classes cause they treat you with disrespect.Helpful?YesNoMichelle of Kansas City, MO on Sept. 12, 2015Satisfaction RatingSomehow my ex used the title for my car as collateral for a loan he took out in his name only. I was not in the state of Oklahoma when he did this, as I had moved to MO and had a VPO taken out against him. He took some girl into the loan office and the employee didn't check her ID, accepted my car title - luckily, this girl didn't sign anything. This is absolutely asinine, and I cannot believe that the employee handled this the way she did. I cannot fathom not checking an ID or not having someone sign something they're using as collateral for a loan like this.I didn't know until I received a new title for my car forwarded to my new address by a friend, and I opened it to see "lien holder World Acceptance Corp". The regional manager for Oklahoma handled this very well, and I commend him for that. He realized the implications of this and agreed to send me a lien release for my car. That is the only reason I am not reporting this atrocity to the attorney general of Oklahoma. If there were ever a company singled out for completely terrible business practices, this would be it. I do not recommend doing business with them, their interest rates are murder. And clearly, they are willing to break laws to make a dime. If my car had been taken by the company, it would have been theft on multiple levels, and fraud. I probably never would have gotten it back, or been slapped with fees and charges for the tow truck, and whatever else costs they would associate with it being possessed.My ex very likely would have defaulted on this loan, and if they had done any kind of credit check they would have known this. He is currently having his wages garnished for defaulting on a loan to Maverick Finance Co. Which at the time he took the loan out with World, he had been sent a "Right to cure" from Maverick and they had already reported to the credit bureaus that he defaulted after making one payment. Add in the CapitalOne Visa that was $183 over the limit in fees with a $300 limit, the Discover card with $231 in overage fees on a $1,000 limit, a First Premier bank Gold card that was about $150 in fees on a $700 limit and about to be turned over to collections because he never even made one single payment, and a Credit One card that was in collections at this time because again, he never made a payment after maxing out the $600 limit. Add in a payday loan from Check n Go and one from Advance America - I am SHOCKED this employee even allowed him to take out a loan here at World Acceptance. He clearly could not afford to pay his bills and credits he had been granted already. So approving him for an installment loan here was a grievous abuse of her power to trap him in a loan he cannot and likely will not pay.I want to say the district manager's name is Roger? He did handle this graciously, but I have to say I did not like that he was trying to get me to admit to coming into the office when I was not in the state and have a VPO against the man who did this. "It doesn't really matter if you did come in because you didn't sign anything." I wasn't there. This was fraud. However, he called me back after I had called the head office for this company and was told I probably wouldn't hear back until Monday, which I understood as I called right before 5pm. He called me I'd say about 20 minutes later and handled the situation, for which I am extremely grateful. But I would not recommend ever using this company as they are currently about to likely be shut down because they use "loophole laws" to charge 80% and more interest fees and prey on desperate people.Helpful?YesNoChance of Graniteville, SC on Aug. 27, 2015Satisfaction RatingThe interest rates aren't posted, they harass you at home and work even after you told them you can't pay them because you get paid biweekly and that your father recently died; and you had to take over his debt load. They are crooks, point blank.Helpful?YesNo

I was approved for a 1998 Chevrolet Tahoe. Once the Tahoe was paid off for the next few years I acquired several loans from Acceptance. From the time I bought the Tahoe up until about 2014 there will not be four months that I was not paying on a loan at Acceptance. For several years while dealing with ** I would get calls and be approved for a separate personal loan during Christmas along with an already on going loan. I kept them all paid. Once ** left I got refused the first Christmas loan. I was told that they were under new management and things were changing.In 2014 I went up and applied for a loan on a Toyota Camry. I told it should not be a problem. At this time my daughter had start working at Acceptance. She said that "they are not going to give you this money." I said "I always get my loans here." She said they just be turning people but I knew my record was good. ** called and said new management would not approve. That day I paid off $1100 dollars to close account at Acceptance and got the money for the car somewhere else so I would not have two bills. I have never to this day received any kind of advertisement, letter or anything from this company since. I think that is bad business.Helpful?YesNoTammy of Piedmont, AL on March 3, 2015Satisfaction RatingI've done business with this company before, I believe it was 2012 or 2013 in Rainbow City. Ms ** and Ms ** were the managers. Anyway it was a very good to had done business with. That the reason I decided to try it again. One mind told me to go back to Rainbow City, but I said that Jacksonville is closer. Actually its right across the street where I work. I needed to purchase a radiator for my car. Little did I know they was gonna cut the hours tremendously. I started getting slack on my payments. My phone was ringing off the hook, for awhile I ignored it. Ms ** called my job, sent a agent out to my house. The lady was real nice and very understanding. I called Ms ** had tried to explain about hours and that I was gonna pay, but please do not call my job. She went to say "you got this loan", and she couldn't hold it. She need to know when I’ll be in. I told her I didn't know. Anyway, let say she was happy with my answer. I eventually found another job. It was 45 minutes away, but I took the job. I needed this job, I endure some things but I stuck in. I wasn't late anymore. I paid the loan off, but then I gets papers to go to court. I being sued for $72. I couldn't believe it. This left a very bad taste in mouth. I did all I could to pay this loan, borrow from my friend, whom I still owe. Had a conversation with Ms **, the other manager. The bottom line is $72 and $111.30, I don’t know how I gonna pay this. But somehow, that Ms ** told that lie in court, that I said, "I’m not gonna pay you and you should just take me to court." Oh well! THIS IS THE END.Helpful?YesNoDaniel of Sapulpa, OK on Jan. 26, 2015Satisfaction RatingI referred a customer to you guys whom successfully acquired a loan back in December. I didn't get my referral check yet so I called. Christy said she mailed it around the 1st of January. I advised I haven't received it and asked what she could do. Her response was "I can't do anything it's already been issued". I said, "Can't you cancel the other one and I could just pick it up to avoid this from happening again?" She says "you'll have to pay the check cancellation fee". I refer someone, I don't receive the referral check. What's the point? And I have to pay for the blunder? How is that fair?Helpful?YesNoJoseph of Birmingham, AL on Dec. 16, 2014Satisfaction RatingWorld Acceptance came to my house harassing me at 6:00 PM at night. I thought it was a burglar. She made very threatening remarks towards me. She said if she has to come back, it would be trouble. I was shocked. She handed me a letter in my hand. I don't think I should be harassed like that. Her name is Veronica.I would like for you to deal with this and respond immediately about what action I can take about being threatened. I'm not even 30 days late. My bill is due on the 28th of December, she came to my house on December 15, 2014. I asked what the late charge was for. She stated there is no grace period. In the four years that I have had this loan, I have never been 30 days late - not once. That is why I am so shocked that I am being harassed. I would like for you to deal with this and respond immediately about what action I can take about being threatened and harassed by World Acceptance Corporation.Helpful?YesNoEdwina of Miami, , OK on July 22, 2011I explained to the lady I don’t always get mail at my address. She was very hateful from the time I sat down until the time I left. I had an Oklahoma license, and that has always worked on loans before. She could be a little nicer.Helpful?YesNoJudy of Cayce, SC on July 13, 2011I have had an account with this branch for close to a year now.  I am not always on time, but I've never been outside of the month with my payment until now.  My payment is due on the 24th of the month.  My account is due for the month of June.  Due to extensive/expensive car repairs, I am late with making this payment.  To date, I have received telephone messages daily both on my cell phone and at my job.  I haven't received the first letter at home.  I haven't had the first World employee knock on my door at home.  This afternoon, a gentleman shows up at my office.  He asks the receptionist if I am in.  I sit perhaps 10 feet away from her.  I spoke up and told the gentleman that I was who he was looking for.  He walked over to my desk and proceeded to tell me who he was, who he was with, why he was there and that his manager wanted me to call her while he was here to let her know when I'd be paying.  I sit at a large desk in an open space with my co-workers all within 10 to 12 feet of me.  I maintained my composure as best I could, told him to take one of my cards off my desk as "proof" to her that he had been here and to tell her I'd see her Friday of this week.  With only being 3 weeks past due and my pay day coming up this Friday, the payment will be made at that time.  I could understand this type of desperate action against me if my account were 2 months or more past due, but we are talking 3 weeks or less here!  Working the same hours as this branch's office hours prevents me from calling them back to let them know these things.  Perhaps an answering service or answering machine might prevent a lot of issues in the future.I am outraged that I have been subjected to this type of invasion on my privacy and can only guess at the repercussions should the company's owner find out that this has happened.  If I lose my job over this, I surely won't be able to pay on my loan at all.  I strongly urge this company to review the practices of this branch in order to divert any possible future legal issues over their choice of methods to collect debts.  While I am not at the point where I am considering getting an attorney involved over this violation of my rights under the FDCPA, I could reconsider that if this type of harassment does not cease immediately!In closing, let me say that I have been in the collections field myself for almost 30 years and I find this lack of common courtesy deplorable in this branch manager.  Perhaps this company should re-think having someone in charge that is obviously so arrogant, young and inexperienced.  These types of "collection practices" could get their company in a legal mess!Helpful?YesNoRhonda of Gaston , sc on Jan. 28, 2011First off, I do not deny that I have had late payments, for I have.  But every time, I do take a call from this company and it's 99% of the time that Liz, calling this woman, yells at me or threatens to serve me at my job so I will be fired.  She has been asked verbally over 5 times to please not call my job.  I also put it in writing in November of 2010 to not call my job due to the fact that I'm not allowed to take calls.  I have received write ups due to her calls.  She still to this day continues to call my job.  This has resulted in 4 write ups and a 2 week-suspension without pay.  And still she says that she will not and does not have to stop calling my job.  I am now catching my loan up.  But to be honest, this is the worst loan company I have dealt with in my entire life.  And I will tell everyone I know to never use them.  This is no way to treat any person.Helpful?YesNoGary of Rock Hill, SC on Aug. 24, 2010I had a loan back in 2007 that was paid off. I have my Equifax credit report and its showing that I am late. This loan was taken care of (paid in full) 2/13/2007. I do have document showing where it was paid off. I have contacted Equifax six times disputing this, they will not remove it because World Acceptance is stating that the reporting history is correct. I have a letter that was sent to me by a Judson K. C. who do not even know how to read a credit report. I am at odds with this company. I have explain to them, if an account has been closed since 2/2007 how can you still report to them as account is being late? I am ready to take the necessary action against them. If you need me to fax over my credit report, document showing the loan was close and my credit report, I can. I really need this matter cleared up.

        	Top
        	CostWhen you take out a loan, chances are you’re thinking more about the cost of the item you’ll purchase with the loan money than about the cost of the loan itself. If you don’t consider the loan cost, that item could end up costing much more than you expect. To ensure that you get the best deal on a loan, make sure you understand all fees associated with it and how interest will accumulate.Interest rate: The interest rate is the money a lender charges you when you borrow money and is a percentage of the total amount borrowed. Your credit score will influence the interest rate a lender charges, because they will charge people deemed higher risk a higher rate. If your loan doesn’t have pre-payment penalties or precomputed interest, you’ll save money on interest by paying your loan off early.
                                    APR: The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is often confused with the interest rate; however, the APR actually accounts for the total cost of the loan, including any one-time fees. When comparing loan offers, look at the APR to get the best price comparison.
                                    Origination fee: The origination, or processing, fee, is a one-time charge that covers the cost of processing a loan. This fee is typically included in the overall loan amount, so you aren’t required to pay it up front.
                                    Pre-payment penalties: Some lenders charge a fee if you pay off your loan early. These fees help the lender make up the money they lose in interest, but they also prevent people from getting out of debt early when they’re able to.
                                    Precomputed interest: Loans with a precomputed interest rate use the original amount instead of the outstanding balance to determine the amount of interest a consumer will pay each billing cycle. This method means your payments may get smaller as time passes. However, if you pay the loan off early, you won’t save any money on interest.
                                    Late payment fees: Most lenders will charge a fee if you pay your bill late. Avoid that fee by setting up autopay from your bank account or just put a reminder on your calendar to keep you on track.
                                    Payment processing fees: Some lenders charge a fee to pay your bill in a certain way. For example, some lenders may charge a small fee if you pay your bill by phone or using a check instead of setting up automatic electronic withdrawals. Make sure you understand these fees and choose a lender that allows you to make your payment in the way you want for free.
                                    TrustworthinessWhen working with a lender, you should choose someone you feel comfortable with and who is trustworthy. In general, if you’re taking out a mortgage or auto loan from a well-established bank or credit union, you can feel confident in the lender’s credibility. If you’re working with an online loan company or new business, make sure to fully research the company to avoid being scammed. Scams may be most likely to occur with unsecured, personal loans.Hold loans vs. flip loans: Determine whether the lender you’re working with will hold the loan after you close or if they’ll flip, or sell, it to another party. While lenders who flip loans aren’t more or less trustworthy than those who don’t, you’ll have to simply accept that the company they sell your loan to will be trustworthy and offer good customer service.
                                    Customer service: Consider how easy it is to get in touch with your lender now to determine if they’ll be easy to reach later if you have any problems. Also consider how patient they are in answering your questions. They should be willing to address all your concerns and explain anything you’re confused about.
                                    Registered: Lenders must be registered to do business with the appropriate authority, usually the department of banking or consumer credit, in every state in which they do business. You can find a list of state licensing authorities on the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System & Registry website.
                                    Mortgage broker vs. loan officerWhen taking out a loan, you’ll have the choice to work with either a mortgage broker or a loan officer. There are perks to each one, so it is important to know the difference.Loan officer: Loan officers work for the bank or lender, so getting a loan through them may be faster than working with a mortgage broker. These individuals are primarily accountable to their employer, so they may not always make recommendations that are best for you.
                                    Mortgage broker: Mortgage brokers are a kind of middle-man between those seeking loans and multiple lenders. If you’re worried that your credit may make it difficult to get a loan, consider working with a broker because they can help you decide which lender is most likely to approve you. These individuals may also be able to help you find a better interest rate because they’ll be comparing multiple lenders.
                                    Other considerationsThere are a variety of other factors to consider when borrowing money. If at any point during the process you’re confused, make sure to discuss the matter with your lender.Expertise: Look for a loan company that specializes in the type of loans you’re considering. If you’re working with a big bank, ask whether they have loan officers who specialize in certain types of loans.
                                    Credit report: All consumers are entitled to get one free report from each credit reporting company every year. If you’re considering taking out a loan, request one of your credit reports as far in advance as possible to make sure no inaccurate information appears on it. Many credit cards show you your credit score for free; knowing your credit score may help you decide whether to work with a loan officer or mortgage broker.
                                    Down payment: If you’re taking out a mortgage or car loan, consider how much of a down payment you’re able to make. The larger your down payment, the less money you’ll need to borrow. Saving a little longer to have a larger down payment could save you a significant amount of interest later.
                                    Special programs: Many homebuyers qualify for special program loans, like FHA or VA loans, for example. Research these options to determine whether you qualify for any special programs before taking out a loan.
                                    Private mortgage insurance: Individuals who qualify for a mortgage but do not have a down payment that accounts for 20 percent of the home’s value may be required to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI), which will allow the lender to recover money if the borrower defaults on the loan. This insurance does not offer any protection to borrowers. PMI is usually between .5 and 1 percent of the total amount of the loan.
                                    What are different types of loans?
        	Top
        	Secured loansSecured loans rely on an asset (such as a car, a home or a boat) that will be used as collateral for the loan.Unsecured loansUnsecured loans are more difficult to qualify for and have higher interest rates because an asset for collateral is not required. These are sometimes called personal loans.Variable rateVariable rate loans have an interest rate that changes based on market rates. Consumers payments will vary based on changing interest rates. They may end up paying more or less in interest based on the overall economic situation.Fixed rateFixed rate loans have an interest rate that remains the same for the entire life of the loan. The payments for these will remain the same, regardless of whether the market interest rate goes up or down.Home loansHome loans, or mortgages, are available to help people finance their homes. Conventional mortgages usually require the borrower to have a down payment for 20 percent of the purchase price.Car loansAuto loans are available for both new and used cars, and consumers can obtain car loans from banks and credit unions as well as most auto dealers.Business loansThose wishing to open a business or expand their current business can take out loans to finance their ventures.FHA loansMany private lenders work with the Federal Housing Authority to offer FHA mortgages. These loans require a much smaller down payment than conventional loans.Veterans Affairs loansArmed service veterans, current service members and their spouses may qualify for a Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgage. These home loans have a very low down payment, and borrowers aren’t required to purchase mortgage insurance.Who should take out a loan?
        	Top
        	House huntersIndividuals who rent should consider taking out a loan to purchase their own home if they have a stable income. Mortgage payments are often lower than rent, and owning their property allows them to build equity.Home ownersHomeowners who want to remodel or improve their house and those who want to lower their interest rate should consider refinancing their home.Small business ownersSmall business owners who want to expand their business should consider a small business loan.Credit card holdersAnyone carrying an outstanding balance on a high interest credit card should consider whether they could save money on interest by taking out an unsecured personal loan.DisclaimerInformation in this guide is general in nature and is intended for informational purposes only; it is not legal, health, investment or tax advice.
