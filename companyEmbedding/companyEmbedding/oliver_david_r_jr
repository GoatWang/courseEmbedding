			David R. Oliver, Jr., age 75, is currently an independent consultant. He served as a strategic advisor, mergers and acquisitions, for European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company North America (EADS NA), a European aerospace corporation, from January 2012 until July 2013. From January 2008 until December 2011, Mr. Oliver served as executive vice president and chief operating officer for EADS NA. Mr. Oliver also served as chief executive officer of the defense division of EADS NA for most of the four years preceding January 2008 except when he was running the EADS portion of the capture effort for the Air Force Tanker program. Before joining EADS NA, Mr. Oliver was stationed in Baghdad as Director of Management and Budget for the Coalition Forces. Prior to that, he served as the United States' Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology. Mr. Oliver also previously held management positions at both Westinghouse Electric and Northrop Grumman. In the Navy, he commanded diesel and nuclear submarines as well as two submarine groups during the Cold War. His last Navy appointment was as Principal Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition. Rear Admiral (retired) Oliver's military decorations include the Defense and Navy Distinguished Service Medals as well as six awards of the Legion of Merit. We believe Mr. Oliver's qualifications to sit on our Board include his extensive leadership, management and budgeting experience gained while serving as a senior officer in the United States Navy and at EADS, NA, and his valuable corporate governance experience gained while serving as a director for other public and private companies. Mr. Oliver has been a director of our company since September 2006.

Rear Admiral David "Dave" R. Oliver, Jr. (Ret.) was the executive vice president of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS) for North America. Currently he is an independent consultant. Since September 21, 2006 he has been the director of the American Superconductor Corporation.[1]

Oliver graduated from the United States Naval Academy. He received a Master of Arts in Political Science and International Affairs (Middle East) from American University.[2]

NavyEdit
While in the Navy, Oliver commanded diesel and nuclear submarines, as well as two submarines groups in the Cold War, one in Japan and one in San Diego. His final appointment in the Navy was Principal Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition. His Military decorations include Defense and Navy Distinguished Service Medals and six awards of the Legion of Merit.[2][3]
Oliver retired in 1995.

CareerEdit
David R. Oliver, Jr. held management positions at Westinghouse Electric and Northrop Grumman.
For both the Clinton and Bush Administrations, Oliver served as the Principal Deputy under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.[2]
He was stationed in Baghdad, Iraq as Director of Management and Budget for the Coalition Forces.[3][4]
Between 2004-2008 Oliver was the Chief Executive Officer of the Defense Division of EADS North America. During this time he ran the EADS portion of the capture effort for the Air Force Tanker Program.
From January 2008 through December 2011 Oliver held the title of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of EADS.[3] In this position, he oversaw marketing, business development activities, and managed the operational activities of the EADS North America holding company.[4]
Oliver continued to grow with the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company for the North American division. He also served as a strategic advisor, mergers and acquisitions, from January 2012 to July 2013.[3]
Oliver is also a published author. He wrote an instruction primer for political appointees titled Making it in Washington. He also penned a management book, Lead On, and his wife's biography, Wide Blue Ribbon.[2] His latest book is on leadership, featuring examples from the naval career of Hyman G. Rickover.  It was published in Nov. 2014 by the United States Naval Institute Press.[5][6]
