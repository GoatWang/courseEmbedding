After the expiration of such sixty-day cure period, you or Snap may commence an arbitration proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to by you and Snap in writing, the arbitration of any Claim under these Terms shall be referred to JAMS under its rules and procedures, be decided before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry, and will follow substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this section will be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the FAA.

Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator’s award; and any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction.
