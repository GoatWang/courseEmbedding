Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Board of Trustees of  State Street
Navigator Securities Lending Prime Portfolio  We have examined managements assertion, included in the accompanying Management Statement
Regarding Compliance with Certain Provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, that State Street Navigator Securities Lending Prime Portfolio (the Fund) complied with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of Rule
17f-2 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Act) as of November 30, 2011. Management is responsible for the Funds compliance with those requirements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements
assertion about the Funds compliance based on our examination.  Our examination was conducted in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Funds compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. Included among our procedures were the following tests performed as of November 30, 2011, and with respect to agreement of security purchases and sales, for the period from September 30, 2011 (the date of our last examination),
through November 30, 2011:   


 

 
 For securities which were held by the Fund at November 30, 2011, we read the reconciliations of the State Street Bank and Trust Company
(Custodian) investment securities to the positions held for the Custodians account at an omnibus level at the Depository Trust Company. We also independently confirmed each of these securities held by the Depository Trust Company
in book entry form at an omnibus level;   


 

 
 Confirmation of all domestic and foreign time deposits at November 30, 2011 with counterparty brokers and banks; 
 


 

 
 Agreed the Custodians Eurodollar certificates of deposit positions in aggregate at November 30, 2011 to the position held in an omnibus account
and independently confirmed the positions in the omnibus account with the Funds sub-custodian, Deutsche Bank, London Branch;   


 

 
 Reconciliation of all such securities to the books and records of the Fund and the Custodian; 
 


 

 
 Confirmation of all repurchase agreements with brokers/banks and agreement of underlying collateral with Custodian records; and
  


 

 
 Agreement of 25 security purchases and 25 security sales or maturities since our last report from the books and records of the Fund to subsequent
security settlement through review of cash activity.  We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion. Our examination does not provide a legal determination on the Funds compliance with specified requirements.  In our opinion,
managements assertion that State Street Navigator Securities Lending Prime Portfolio complied with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of Rule 17f-2 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as of November 30, 2011 with respect
to securities reflected in the investment account of the Fund is fairly stated, in all material respects.  This report is intended solely for
the information and use of management and the Board of Trustees of State Street Navigator Securities Lending Prime Portfolio and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these
specified parties.  /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  May 7, 2012 


Management Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain Provisions of the Investment
Company Act of 1940  The undersigned, President and Treasurer of State Street Navigator Securities Lending Prime Portfolio (the
Fund), a series of State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust, as members of management of the Fund, are responsible for complying with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of Rule 17f-2, Custody of Investments by
Registered Management Investment Companies, under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). We are also responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over compliance with those
requirements. We have performed, or caused to be performed, an evaluation of the Funds compliance with the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of Rule 17f-2 as of November 30, 2011, and from September 30, 2011 through
November 30, 2011.  Based on this evaluation, we assert that, to the best of our knowledge, the Fund was in compliance with the
requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of Rule 17f-2 under the 1940 Act as of November 30, 2011, and from September 30, 2011 through November 30, 2011, with respect to securities and similar investments of the Fund.
 State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust  /s/ Jim Ross  President  5/7/2012  State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust

Press Release - Statement from State Street Regarding Market Misunderstandings 









 


 


 



Press Releases





 

Statement from State Street Regarding Market Misunderstandings 18/09/2008 
 Boston, September 18, 2008 – In response to questions received today from media and other sources, State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) confirms that, as previously disclosed, it does not believe consolidation of its conduits is required. State Street confirms that even if it had to consolidate its conduits, it would remain well capitalized with ample sources of liquidity. The company raised $2.8 billion in equity capital in early June 2008 and does not currently have any plans to raise additional equity. 
 The net asset value (NAV) of State Street Global Advisors’ money market funds has never declined below $1, including in its Short Term Investment Fund (STIF), Government Short Term Investment Fund (GSTIF) and the Navigator Securities Lending Trust, a registered fund that is used in connection with collateral management for State Street securities lending program. These funds do not have any unsecured exposure to AIG, Lehman, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley. 
 State Street for its own account does not hold any equity positions in unaffiliated financial institutions. The company is often reported to be an owner of many issuers because of its position as a large custodian and a large index fund manager. 
 State Street Corporation (NYSE: STT) is the world's leading provider of financial services to institutional investors, including investment servicing, investment management and investment research and trading. With $15.3 trillion in assets under custody and $1.9 trillion in assets under management at June 30, 2008, State Street operates in 26 countries and more than 100 geographic markets worldwide. For more information, visit State Street’s web site at www.statestreet.com. 
 
 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This news announcement contains forward-looking statements as defined by United States securities laws, including statements about State Street’s goals and expectations, the financial outlook and business environment. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, are inherently uncertain, are based on current assumptions that are difficult to predict and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing State Street's expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to the date of this release. Important factors that may affect future results and outcomes include: 

   the level and volatility of interest rates, particularly in the U.S., Europe and the Asia/Pacific region; the performance and volatility of securities, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; and economic conditions and monetary and other governmental actions designed to address those conditions; 
   the liquidity of the U.S. and International securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities, including asset-backed commercial paper; and the liquidity requirements of State Street’s customers; 
   State Street's ability to attract non-interest bearing deposits and other low-cost funds; and 
   State Street's ability to manage systemic risks and control operating risks. 

  Other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in State Street's 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its subsequent SEC filings, including, in particular, its Current Report on Form 8-K dated June 2, 2008. State Street encourages investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on Risk Factors, and its subsequent SEC filings for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof, September 18, 2008, and State Street does not undertake efforts to revise those forward-looking statements to reflect events after this date.
