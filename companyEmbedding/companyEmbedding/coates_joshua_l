Josh Coates





 
 



Josh Coates began his career in distributed systems research at the University of California, Berkeley and Microsoft's Bay Area Research Center.  Josh specialized in high performance and parallel disk and network I/O.  In 1998 Josh graduated with a degree in Computer Science and began working at Inktomi Corporation developing network caching software.

In 1999 Josh founded Scale Eight, which developed scalable storage software technologies. Scale Eight’s customers included Microsoft, Viacom and Fujitsu.

 








Scale Eight closed operations in early 2003 and sold its intellectual property to Intel Corporation. Josh then moved on to the non-profit Internet Archive. Josh directed engineering and operations and was tasked to build out their Petabyte data center in San Francisco.

In 2004, Josh relocated his family to Highland, Utah. The following year he founded Berkeley Data Systems (Mozy.com.)  Within two years Mozy had acquired over 300,000 customers, including over 8,000 business contracts.  In October of 2007 Mozy was sold to EMC for $76 million and is now run as a wholly owned subsidiary of EMC. 

In 2007 Josh began volunteering as an adjunct instructor in the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young University. He officially left EMC/Mozy/Decho in January of 2009.

Josh is now the CEO of Instructure, a software company focused on education.

Josh Coates





 
 



Josh Coates began his career in distributed systems research at the University of California, Berkeley and Microsoft's Bay Area Research Center.  Josh specialized in high performance and parallel disk and network I/O.  In 1998 Josh graduated with a degree in Computer Science and began working at Inktomi Corporation developing network caching software.

In 1999 Josh founded Scale Eight, which developed scalable storage software technologies. Scale Eight’s customers included Microsoft, Viacom and Fujitsu.

 








Scale Eight closed operations in early 2003 and sold its intellectual property to Intel Corporation. Josh then moved on to the non-profit Internet Archive. Josh directed engineering and operations and was tasked to build out their Petabyte data center in San Francisco.

In 2004, Josh relocated his family to Highland, Utah. The following year he founded Berkeley Data Systems (Mozy.com.)  Within two years Mozy had acquired over 300,000 customers, including over 8,000 business contracts.  In October of 2007 Mozy was sold to EMC for $76 million and is now run as a wholly owned subsidiary of EMC. 

In 2007 Josh began volunteering as an adjunct instructor in the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young University. He officially left EMC/Mozy/Decho in January of 2009.

Josh is now the CEO of Instructure, a software company focused on education.
