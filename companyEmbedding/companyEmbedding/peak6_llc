The PEAK6 Difference
Located in the historic Chicago Board of Trade Building, PEAK6 is redefining what it means to be an investment firm. We’re driven to see solutions others don’t—and capitalize on opportunities others miss. We operate with a focused, entrepreneurial drive and push ourselves to think differently.
This ambitious, visionary approach has helped us become the diverse range of successful businesses we are today, which include investments and businesses across a range of industries.
The foundation of our business, PEAK6 Capital Management, LLC is a proprietary trading business with a 20-year track record of success that provides significant liquidity throughout U.S. financial markets.

Acquired in 2012, Apex Clearing Corporation is a leading provider of clearing and execution solutions to the financial services industry.

From sports teams to consumer goods to innovative online properties, PEAK6 Investments looks for opportunities where we can successfully provide operational help or capital investment to bring ideas to life.

Founded on a great idea
PEAK6 Investments, L.P. was created from the same ambitious, entrepreneurial culture that thrives in the firm today. Co-founders Matt Hulsizer and Jenny Just started their careers at O’Connor and Associates — a Chicago-based options trading firm with a particular specialty, and emphasis, on financial derivatives. In 1992, the firm was acquired by Swiss Bank Corporation. After the acquisition, Swiss Bank decided to head in a new direction.
Entrepreneurs at heart, Matt and Jenny wanted to bring a different vision to life and decided to launch their own firm. And in 1997, PEAK6 Investments was launched. PEAK6 Investments became one of the first firms to develop sophisticated, proprietary technology, which more efficiently manages risk in the options market. This disciplined focus on risk management and technology has helped us achieve significant success in managing risk and making markets. From this singular focus, the firm continued to innovate, growing PEAK6 into a diverse group of thriving, successful businesses that now span many areas of the financial services sector.
2006 
In 2006, PEAK6 launched two new businesses, looking to reach an entirely different set of investors. PEAK6 launched OptionsHouse — an online, consumer retail brokerage that delivered an exceptional combination of value and technology for active options traders. PEAK6 also launched PEAK6 Advisors, LLC — an SEC-registered investment adviser.
2012 
Then, in 2012, PEAK6 expanded its operational expertise into the clearing business with an investment into Apex Clearing Corporation. By combining decades of experience in clearing and execution with PEAK6’s innovative approach to risk management and sophisticated technology solutions, Apex established itself as a leading provider of clearing and execution solutions to the financial services industry.
2014 
After building OptionsHouse into a thriving online brokerage, PEAK6 sold OptionsHouse to General Atlantic, a well-established global growth investor. Also this year, after growing PEAK6 Advisors’ assets under management to over $2 billion, PEAK6 sold its stake in Advisors to Joe Scoby, former CEO of PEAK6 Advisors.
Today 
Today, PEAK6 remains anything but your typical investment firm. Every day, our culture motivates us to seek out, and invest in, good ideas that have the potential of becoming great businesses. We’re always looking for ways to deliver untapped, exceptional value to the market.
Why the name “PEAK6”?
Not surprisingly, the story behind the PEAK6 name began in the mountains. Matt was in Breckenridge, Colorado and inspiration struck. He recalled someone once telling him it takes 6 peaks to make a mountain range. He was drawn to this notion of peaks and how they can stand alone and/or work together to form something even more powerful. This perfectly represented the vision for the new firm. And with that, the PEAK6 name took hold. Interestingly, the peak that Matt used as inspiration for our name so many years ago opened to the public in 2013. They named it Peak6. And no — we had nothing to do with it. It’s just fate working its magic.

 Website

 peak6.com



PEAK6 Investments is a financial services firm located in Chicago that includes market making, risk management, a hedge fund and proprietary trading operations.[1][2]
Its subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is a major options market maker and proprietary trading firm, which the firm says is one of the largest options trading operations in the U.S.[3]  The company provides online stock and options brokerage through its OptionsHouse, LLC subsidiary.
PEAK6 also launched options news and information service The Options News Network, or ONN.tv in September 2008.[4]
In May of 2012 Peak6 joined with Penson Worldwide Inc. to create a new entity within Penson called Apex Clearing Corp. Apex intends on acquiring the securities accounts previously held by Penson's broker-dealer arm, Penson Financial Services. In June 2012, Penson announced it was selling it's Chicago-based futures division to Knight Capital Group. [5]
The firm also has a simulated trading facility called WeSeed LLC (or www.WeSeed.com), which provides beginner traders with a platform to learn how to trade stocks. 
PEAK6 also has interests in financial technology firms Stockgroup and ELX Electronic Liquidity Exchange and invests in and runs hedge funds.[6]  Its subsidiary PEAK6 Capital Management is an options market maker and proprietary trading firm.   
In September of 2014 the company said it would spin out its $2.3 billion hedge-fund business, Peak6 Advisors, which would change its name to Achievement Asset Management and focus on growth by trading European credit and stocks out of a new London office. The renamed business will continue to be led by CEO Joseph Scoby, who will buy out the roughly 50% stake in the hedge-fund business that Peak6 Investments owns.[7]

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
