Name and Web domain changes 
Please note that effective May 11, 2017 Entrée Gold Inc. has changed its name to “Entrée Resources Ltd”. 

Click here to visit the Entrée Resources Ltd. website or copy www.entreeresourcesltd.com into your browser.

Entrée Resources Ltd. is a Canadian mineral exploration company with a unique carried joint venture interest on a significant portion of one of the world’s largest copper-gold projects – the Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia.  The Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi Joint Venture Property includes the Hugo North Extension and Heruga copper-gold deposits, as well as a large underexplored, highly prospective land package. Rio Tinto is managing the construction of Lift 1 of the Hugo North underground block cave on both the Oyu Tolgoi mining license and the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi Joint Venture Property. Lift 1 underground development is fully financed ($4.3 billion drawn down) and is currently in progress, with more than 2,000 workers on site. Entrée has a 30% carried interest in all mineralization identified above 560 metres elevation, and a 20% carried interest in all mineralization extracted below 560 metres elevation from the Entrée/Oyu Tolgoi Joint Venture Property. Sandstorm Gold Ltd., Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. are major shareholders, holding approximately 14%, 10% and 8% of issued and outstanding Entrée Common Shares, respectively.

Entrée has also spun out its US based assets into a new separately listed company called “Mason Resources Corp.”

Mason Resources Corp. is a well-funded Canadian copper exploration and development company focused in the U.S.A.  The Company’s key asset is its 100% owned Ann Mason Project – an extensive, prospective land package located in the Yerington District of Nevada. The Ann Mason Project hosts two copper-molybdenum porphyry deposits, Ann Mason and Blue Hill, as well as numerous earlier-stage or untested priority targets.  The Ann Mason deposit is currently at a PEA level and is among the largest undeveloped copper porphyry resources in Canada/U.S.A. The excellent infrastructure, year-round access, strong community support and clear permitting process are all factors that contribute to making Yerington, Nevada one of the best mining jurisdictions in the world. Mason also holds a 100% interest in the Lordsburg property, an exciting earlier-stage copper-gold porphyry project, located within an historic mining district in New Mexico.
Mason’s strong financial position and high-quality asset portfolio provide it with a solid foundation and flexibility for growth, by advancing development of Ann Mason towards Pre-Feasibility, introducing one or more strategic development partners, exploring high priority targets or considering strategic acquisitions.

Hugo North Extension and Heruga
Entrée Gold Inc.

PHOTOS
INFO




The Hugo North Extension is a rich copper-gold porphyry deposit and Heruga is a copper-gold-molybdenum porphyry deposit. Both projects are located in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia, approximately 570 kilometers south of the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and 80 kilometers north of the border with China. The Hugo North Extension and Heruga are part of the Oyu Tolgoi mining complex and are managed by Oyu Tolgoi LLC, a subsidiary of Turquoise Hill Resources and the Government of Mongolia, and its project manager Rio Tinto PLC. Entrée retains a 20% interest in the resource deposits of the Hugo North Extension and Heruga.
Entrée recently announced that an Oyu Tolgoi underground mine development and financing plan had been signed by the Government of Mongolia, Entrée's joint venture partner, Oyu Tolgoi LLC, Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. and Rio Tinto. The plan provides a path forward to the eventual restart of underground development, including Lift 1 of the Hugo North Extension. Recently, Entrée’s joint venture partner, announced that it had signed a $4.4 billion finance facility for underground mine development at the Oyu Tolgoi project. The facility is being provided by a syndicate of international financial institutions and export credit agencies representing the governments of Canada, the United States and Australia, along with 15 commercial banks.
Terms
Sandstorm has agreed to purchase an amount equal to 5.62% and 4.26% of the gold and silver by-products produced from the Hugo North Extension and Heruga deposits, respectively and an amount equal to 0.42% of the copper produced. Sandstorm will make ongoing payments equal to US$220 per ounce of gold, US$5 per ounce of silver and US$0.50 per pound of copper (subject to inflationary adjustments) until approximately 8.6 million ounces of gold, 40.3 million ounces of silver and 9.1 billion pounds of copper have been produced from the joint venture property. Thereafter, the purchase price will increase to US$500 per ounce of gold, US$10 per ounce of silver and US$1.10 per pound of copper (subject to inflationary adjustments). Sandstorm made an upfront cash deposit of US$40 million to acquire the stream in February 2013.

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company.

Entree Gold: A Sleeping Copper Giant - Entree Gold Inc (NYSEMKT:EGI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Entree Gold: A Sleeping Copper GiantAug.10.11 | About: Entree Gold (EGI) Robert Kientz This is the second in a 10-part metals miner series. Entrée Gold (NYSEMKT:EGI) is a copper and gold exploration company with assets and interests in Mongolia, Nevada, Australia, and Peru. The company currently holds 811 million tons of indicated and inferred copper, ranking it #8 among companies with copper in the ground. In addition, the company holds interests in Yerington Mine, the #1 copper mining district in the US, which had previously produced 1.8 billion pounds of copper from 1918-82. The company’s Lookout Hill property in Mongolia surrounds Ivanhoe Mines’ (IVN) Oyu Tolgoi project, a part of which is subject to a joint venture with Ivanhoe Mines.
[Click to enlarge]

Entrée has recorded 2.25 million ounces of gold, probable and inferred, in the various properties. Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) holds 13% of Entrée gold stock while Ivanhoe holds 11%. Management and directors hold 11% as well. Entrée’s treasury is currently $15 million, giving it about one and a half years of cash at current burn rates. Entrée has issued 124 million shares and currently trades at $2.04 per share.
With world markets expected to be half a million tons short of copper demand this year and facing additional demand increases from China and India, Entrée is positioned to become a major player in the copper market. Production is first expected in the Hugo North property in 2016, with production from Heruga expected to follow between 2019-22. 
Therefore, this is a long term stock play that may not pay off for several years. But given the large amount of in-ground copper with additional unexplored assets, Entrée should be considered a sleeping giant in the copper miner category.

Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Why Invest in Gold?


For thousands of years, in good times and bad, gold has offered holders a solid, long-term and tangible way to hold and protect wealth.  Unlike paper investments (like stocks, bonds and currencies) that can and have become worthless overnight, gold has true intrinsic value . . . and, hence, will always be valuable.  What’s more, in recent years, gold has also been utilized as a short-term trading product, offering traders opportunity to profit as gold prices fluctuate, sometimes dramatically, on world markets.


Gold Products Available


Monex offers gold bullion in three convenient forms: The 10 ounce gold bullion bar of at least .995 fine purity (the standard industry unit) . . . the 32.15 troy ounce gold “kilobar” (a one kilogram bar of fine gold bullion of at least .999 purity) . . . and the exclusive Monex-certified 10 ounce gold bullion ingot composed of pure .9999 (or “four-nines”) fine gold bullion, among the purest gold bullion bars available to investors today.  Pure, 24 karat gold bullion coins available from Monex include the one ounce American Buffalo . . . the one ounce, quarter ounce and tenth ounce Canadian Maple Leaf . . . special limited-issue one ounce, 99.999% (“five-nines”) pure gold coins from the Royal Canadian Mint . . . and the one ounce, quarter ounce and tenth ounce Vienna Philharmonic.  Monex also offers 22 karat gold bullion coins (which generally contain copper as a hardener) and these include the American Eagle gold coins which contain exactly one ounce, quarter ounce or tenth ounce of pure gold . . . and the South African Krugerrand which contains exactly one ounce of pure gold.

Monex Pricing Advantage


It is easy to confirm that Monex offers some of the best prices available on precious metals products by simply comparing our prices with those of other dealers. But what really sets Monex apart from others is that we also feature transparent pricing. We show you, right here on this website, our bid and ask prices. Our “spread” – the difference between our “ask” and “bid” prices – tends to be far less than many other dealers. Not only that, but we also offer lower Atlas Preferred Prices on purchases made with the Monex Atlas Account on a number of our bullion and coin products.

Why Invest in Gold Bars?


Throughout time, from the Greek and Roman ages to more modern times, civilizations flourished with sound money. Gold bars have proven to be a time-tested answer for societies desiring to store wealth. The alternative, fiat currency, has resulted in the demise of prosperous civilizations since Roman times. The word “fiat” means by government edict. It is simply impossible for a government to magically proclaim sound money and reliable purchasing power of wealth with paper currency. This fact prompts Americans to consider investing in gold bars.


Gold Bars Available


Gold bullion is available from Monex in three convenient forms: The 10 ounce gold bullion bar of at least .995 fine purity is the standard industry unit.  It is traditionally used for trading and storage, and can also be taken for personal delivery. Each gold bar is hallmarked by a leading refiner to certify weight and purity.  Also available is the 32.15 troy ounce gold “kilobar,” a one kilogram bar of fine gold bullion of at least .999 purity. Manufacturers of these bars certify the weight and purity of the bullion content by imprinting their stamp or hallmark on each bar. And finally, for those who want the finest investment-grade gold bullion bars available, we proudly offer the exclusive Monex-certified 10 ounce gold bullion ingot composed of pure .9999 (or “four-nines”) fine gold bullion is among the purest gold bullion bars available to investors today.
