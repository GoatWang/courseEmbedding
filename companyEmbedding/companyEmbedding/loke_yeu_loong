        Probing benefits of bird’s nest
       
    
by kelly tey















Tan (seated, left) and Dr Adeeba (right) signing the MOU, witnessed by Universiti Malaya medical faculty deputy dean Prof Dr Mohd Rais Mustafa, Swiftlet Eco Park Group group executive chairman Datuk Seri Dr Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan, Dr Quaza, Swiflet Eco Park Group group managing director Loke Yeu Loong and board of directors member Choy Cheng Chong.























UNIVERSITI Malaya (UM) is working with Royal Bird’s Nest Sdn Bhd to study the medicinal values of bird’s nest.
Following the signing of a memorandum of agreement, UM will be conducting research focusing on the benefits of bird’s nest in three areas — Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, inflammation and asthma.
Universiti Malaya medical faculty dean Prof Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman said the university was pleased to enter the partnership with the company in order to study the medicinal values of the product.
“The world moves toward scientific evidence. 
“There will always be sceptics, but with this collaboration, we could unlock the properties of bird’s nest with scientifically-proven results,” she said.
Dr Adeeba said, recent findings had also shown bird’s nest’s potential in treating osteoarthritis while further studies are being carried out in relation to cancer. 
Through the agreement, the university will get an unlimited supply of bird’s nest from Royal Bird’s Nest for research purposes.
According to Royal Bird’s Nest chief executive officer Tan Chee Hong, there was a need to move beyond the Chinese market, both locally and abroad.


Hexacells (front) is a stem cell oral spray with bird’s nest extract.

 
“It is a challenge to share this with the rest of the world, and what the professor said is right; in order to reach out, we need medical and scientific proof,” he said.
Tan said Malaysia was the only country carrying out such research at the moment. 
By mid-June, Royal Bird’s Nest, which is a subsidiary of Swiftlet Eco Park Group of Companies, is looking to sign on with QMIS Finance Securities Ltd based in the US.
“They will act as our consultants for the company to go into an initial public offering (IPO) listing in the US later this year,” said Tan.
He said they would tap on this platform to showcase bird’s nest, both raw and in products, to the world as well as to attract investors.
Royal Bird’s Nest also offers various bird’s nest-based products including functional food products, skincare, confectionery and beverages. 
During the signing ceremony, Department of Veterinary Services (DVS) deputy director-general Datuk Dr Quaza Nizamuddin said the government would continue to fund the industry’s research for economic growth.

“Since 2011, the government has provided RM8.2mil towards edible bird’s nest research and will continue to fund RM2mil every year over the next five to six years,” he said.
Dr Quaza said there was a targeted export volume of 200 tonnes of raw bird’s nest this year compared to 145 tonnes last year.
He said that as of April, the country was still within the expected export target rate.
In line with the signing ceremony, the company held a soft launch for its latest product, Hexacellz, a stem cell oral spray product.

Bird Nests Made with Saliva: One of the Worlds Most Expensive Foods - NDTV Food

NDTVBusinessHindiMoviesCricketHealthFoodTechAutoAppsPrimeArtWeddingsSEARCHHomeFood & DrinksBird Nests Made With Saliva: One Of The World's Most Expensive FoodsBird Nests Made with Saliva: One of the World's Most Expensive FoodsReuters    |                       Updated: February 25, 2015 10:18 ISTTweeterfacebookGoogle Plus RedditTwo styles of cleaned bird's nest, Yan Zhan (L) and Su Zhan (R) await repacking at a processing plant in Kuala Lumpur, February 17, 2015. REUTERS/Olivia Harris	Prized in China for its alleged health benefits for hundreds of years, nests made from swiftlets' saliva are being mixed into coffee and cereal as the Southeast Asian producers of the delicacy seek to broaden its appeal, and their profit margins.	The nests are among the world's most expensive foods, selling for up to $2,500 a kg and the swiftlets that weave them are indigenous to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. China consumes almost 90 percent of all bird's nests, traditionally eaten in soup, creating an industry that last year recorded $5 billion in sales and which executives expect to double by 2020.	Companies such as Malaysia's Swiftlet Eco Park, one of the country's largest developers of swiftlet houses, want bigger gains by expanding their product line and market beyond China, where importers can often dictate the price.	"Ask anybody in the industry where is your market and they'll say China and Hong Kong. Everybody is going there," said Group Managing Director Loke Yeu Loong. "We are looking at new markets, but if I sell raw bird's nest to Europe or India, they don't even know how to cook it."	Swiftlet Eco makes coffee, skin care, puddings and candies with bird's nest. Loke declined to give specific sales figures but said the profit margin on some of these products was 10 times more than the raw nests.	The company is also spending big on marketing bird's nest as a health food in the Middle East, Europe and the United States and plans to raise about $30 million through an initial public offering and New York listing in the third quarter of this year.	Southeast Asian swiftlets' nests are particularly popular in the Lunar New Year festivities, which began in China last week, and are believed to be rich in nutrients that can help digestion, raise libido and improve the immune system. Malaysia is the world's largest producer of raw nests after Indonesia.	Lee Kong Heng, president of the Malaysian Federation of Bird's Nest Traders Association, says marketing bird's nest as a supplement would attract younger, wealthier and more health-conscious consumers worldwide.	Vietnam's largest birds' nest producer Yen Viet Joint Stock Co. is also keen to play up the benefits of the delicacy. The company makes cereals and porridge and is investing into scientific research in a bid to increase global sales, said Chief Executive Dang Pham Minh Loan.	Malaysian bird's nest producers are well placed to market to the majority Muslim Middle Eastbecause the nests are halal, or a food permissible under Islam, Swiftlet Eco Park's Loke said. With more research, he hopes birds nest will become a global phenomenon.

Bird spit coffee? Asia firms seek global appetite for China delicacy

Prized in China for its alleged health benefits for hundreds of years, nests made from swiftlets' saliva are being mixed into coffee and cereal as the Southeast Asian producers of the delicacy seek to broaden its appeal, and their profit margins. 
  The nests are among the world's most expensive foods, selling for up to $2,500 a kg and the swiftlets that weave them are indigenous to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
  China consumes almost 90 percent of all bird's nests, traditionally eaten in soup, creating an industry that last year recorded $5 billion in sales and which executives expect to double by 2020. 

  Companies such as Malaysia's Swiftlet Eco Park, one of the country's largest developers of swiftlet houses, want bigger gains by expanding their product line and market beyond China, where importers can often dictate the price.

            Cramer: These food companies now irrelevant   
			                        Friday, 13 Feb 2015 |  6:25  PM ET |  05:40 




  "Ask anybody in the industry where is your market and they'll say China and Hong Kong. Everybody is going there," said Group Managing Director Loke Yeu Loong. "We are looking at new markets, but if I sell raw bird's nest to Europe or India, they don't even know how to cook it." 
  Swiftlet Eco makes coffee, skin care, puddings and candies with bird's nest. Loke declined to give specific sales figures but said the profit margin on some of these products was 10 times more than the raw nests. 
  The company is also spending big on marketing bird's nest as a health food in the Middle East, Europe and the United States and plans to raise about $30 million through an initial public offering and New York listing in the third quarter of this year.

  Southeast Asian swiftlets' nests are particularly popular in the Lunar New Year festivities, which began in China last week, and are believed to be rich in nutrients that can help digestion, raise libido and improve the immune system. 
  Malaysia is the world's largest producer of raw nests after Indonesia. 
  Lee Kong Heng, president of the Malaysian Federation of Bird's Nest Traders Association, says marketing bird's nest as a supplement would attract younger, wealthier and more health-conscious consumers worldwide. 
  Vietnam's largest birds' nest producer Yen Viet Joint Stock Co. is also keen to play up the benefits of the delicacy. The company makes cereals and porridge and is investing into scientific research in a bid to increase global sales, said Chief Executive Dang Pham Minh Loan. 
  Malaysian bird's nest producers are well placed to market to the majority Muslim Middle East because the nests are halal, or a food permissible under Islam, Swiftlet Eco Park's Loke said. 
  With more research, he hopes birds nest will become a global phenomenon. "We can conduct research and prove the benefit of consuming bird's nest scientifically," he said.
