NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C:
    


      --$286,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$315,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$150,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$377,500,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$121,570,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,520,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,350,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The pool is consistent with recent deals, the 
      highest weighted average (WA) FICO score seen to date at 736, and the 
      highest percentage of new vehicles seen to date at 89.8%. The pool is 
      geographically diverse and has WA seasoning of 7.8 months, and 54.5% of 
      the loans have terms of 61 months or more.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes totals 5.54%, consisting of 5.00% subordination and a 
      0.54% non-declining reserve, all consistent with recent transactions.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      Ford Credit's portfolio and 2012 - 2015 securitizations are currently at 
      low levels, supported by the stable U.S. economy and healthy used 
      vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year. 
      Fitch's initial base case cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption is 1.50%.
    

      Stable Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term Issuer Default 
      Rating (IDR) for Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford Credit, and 
      Ford Credit, is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as an originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and 
      loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer for this 
      series.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the 
      notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all 
      classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. 
      Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. 
      However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating 
      categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on its analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by

      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch

      titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

ACCOUNT CONTROL AGREEMENT, dated as
of October 1, 2016 (this “ Agreement ”),
among FORD CREDIT AUTO OWNER TRUST 2016-C, a Delaware statutory
trust, as grantor (the “ Grantor ”), THE BANK OF
NEW YORK MELLON, a New York banking corporation, as Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders (in this capacity, the
“ Secured Party ”), and THE BANK OF NEW YORK
MELLON, a New York banking corporation, in its capacity as both a
“securities intermediary” as defined in
Section 8-102 of the UCC and a “bank” as defined
in Section 9-102 of the UCC (in these capacities, the “
Financial Institution ”).
 
BACKGROUND
 

The Grantor is engaging in a
securitization transaction in which it will issue the Notes under
an Indenture and the Secured Party will hold funds in bank accounts
for the benefit of the Noteholders.
 

The parties are entering into this
Agreement to perfect the security interest in the bank
accounts.
 

The parties agree as
follows:
 
ARTICLE I
USAGE AND DEFINITIONS
 

Section 1.1.
                                
Usage and Definitions
.  Capitalized terms used but
not defined in this Agreement are defined in Appendix A to the Sale
and Servicing Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2016, among
Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C, as Issuer, Ford Credit Auto
Receivables Two LLC, as Depositor, and Ford Motor Credit Company
LLC, as Servicer.  Appendix A also contains usage
rules that apply to this Agreement.  Appendix A is
incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  References to
the “ UCC ” mean the Uniform Commercial Code as
in effect in the State of New York.
 
ARTICLE II
ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS
 

Section 2.1.
                                
Description of
Accounts .  The
Financial Institution has established the following accounts (each,
a “ Collateral Account ”):
 

“Collection Account —
The Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as secured party
for Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C” with account number
1817608400; and
 

“Reserve Account — The
Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as secured party for
Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C” with account number
1817708400.
 

Section 2.2.
                                
Account Changes
.  Neither the Financial
Institution nor the Grantor will change the name or account number
of a Collateral Account without the consent of the Secured
Party.  The Financial Institution will promptly notify the
Servicer of any changes.  This
 





 
Agreement will apply to each successor account
to a Collateral Account, which will also be a Collateral
Account.
 

Section 2.3.
                                
Account Types
.  The Financial Institution
agrees that each Collateral Account is, and will be maintained as,
either a “securities account” (as defined in
Section 8-501 of the UCC) or a “deposit account”
(as defined in Section 9-102(a)(29) of the UCC).
 

Section 2.4.
                                
Securities Accounts
.   If a Collateral
Account is a securities account, the Financial Institution agrees
that:
 

(a)                                 
Financial Assets
.  It will promptly credit each
item of property (whether cash, investment property, security,
instrument or other financial asset) delivered to the Financial
Institution under the Indenture to the Collateral Account and treat
each item of property as a “financial asset” (within
the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC);
and
 

(b)                                 
Registration and
Indorsement .  It
will ensure that all financial assets (other than cash) credited to
the Collateral Account are registered in the name of the Financial
Institution, indorsed to the Financial Institution or in blank or
credited to another securities account maintained in the name of
the Financial Institution and that no financial asset credited to
the Collateral Account is registered in the name of the Grantor,
payable to the order of the Grantor or specially indorsed to the
Grantor unless it has been indorsed to the Financial Institution or
in blank.
 
ARTICLE III
SECURED PARTY CONTROL
 

Section 3.1.
                                
Control of Collateral
Accounts .  To
establish “control” of the Collateral Accounts by the
Secured Party under Sections 9-104 and 9-106 of the UCC, the
Financial Institution agrees to comply with any order or
instruction from the Secured Party directing the deposit,
withdrawal, transfer or redemption of the cash or other financial
assets credited to a Collateral Account (a “ Secured Party
Order ”) without the need for consent by the Grantor or
any other Person.
 

Section 3.2.
                                
Investment
Instructions .  If
(a) the Financial Institution has not received a Secured Party
Order for the investment of funds in a Collateral Account by 11:00
a.m. New York time (or another time agreed to by the Financial
Institution) on the Business Day before a Payment Date or
(b) the Financial Institution receives notice from the
Indenture Trustee that a Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Financial Institution will invest and
reinvest funds in the Collateral Account according to the last
investment instruction received, if any.  If no prior
investment instructions have been received or if the instructed
investments are no longer available or permitted, the Indenture
Trustee will notify the Servicer and request new investment
instructions, and the funds will remain uninvested until new
investment instructions are received.
 

Section 3.3.
                                
Conflicting Orders or
Instructions .  If
the Financial Institution receives conflicting orders or
instructions from the Secured Party and the Grantor or any other
Person, the Financial Institution will follow the orders or
instructions of the Secured Party and not the Grantor or such other
Person.

ARTICLE IV
SUBORDINATION OF LIEN; WAIVER OF SET-OFF
 

Section 4.1.
                                
Subordination
.  If the Financial Institution
has a security interest in a Collateral Account, the Financial
Institution agrees that the security interest will be subordinate
to the security interest of the Secured Party.
 

Section 4.2.
                                
Set-off and Recoupment
.  The cash, investment
property, security, instrument or other financial assets credited
to a Collateral Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off,
recoupment, banker’s lien, or other right in favor of a
Person other than the Secured Party.  However, the Financial
Institution may set off (a) the customary fees and expenses
for the routine maintenance and operation of the Collateral Account
due to the Financial Institution, (b) the face amount of
checks credited to the Collateral Account but subsequently returned
unpaid due to uncollected or insufficient funds and
(c) advances made to settle an investment of funds in the
Collateral Account.
 
ARTICLE V
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

Representations and Warranties .  The Financial Institution represents and
warrants to the Grantor and the Secured Party as

Enforceability
.  This Agreement is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Financial
Institution.
 

(b)                                 
No Agreements with
Grantor .  There are
no agreements between the Financial Institution and the Grantor
relating to a Collateral Account other than this Agreement, the
Indenture and the other Transaction Documents.
 

(c)                                  
No Other Agreements
.  The Financial Institution

in which it has

Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-CHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.10-3.32 (-0.13%)Dow 3021,830.31+33.76 (+0.15%)Nasdaq6,374.68-7.51 (-0.12%)Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-CBusiness WireOctober 25, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C:--$286,700,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';--$315,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$150,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$377,500,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$121,570,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$39,520,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$26,350,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERSStable Credit Quality: The pool is consistent with recent deals, the highest weighted average (WA) FICO score seen to date at 736, and the highest percentage of new vehicles seen to date at 89.8%. The pool is geographically diverse and has WA seasoning of 7.8 months, and 54.5% of the loans have terms of 61 months or more.Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes totals 5.54%, consisting of 5.00% subordination and a 0.54% non-declining reserve, all consistent with recent transactions.Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on Ford Credit's portfolio and 2012 - 2015 securitizations are currently at low levels, supported by the stable U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year. Fitch's initial base case cumulative net loss (CNL) assumption is 1.50%.Stable Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford Credit, and Ford Credit, is 'BBB'/Stable Outlook.Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates adequate abilities as an originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio and securitization delinquency and loss performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer for this series.Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 2016-C to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. Under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario the notes would be unlikely to experience any downgrade. However, the notes could experience downgrades of up to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or re-computing certain information with respect to 125 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on its analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMSA description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under "Related Research" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled "Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions," dated May 31, 2016.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Read MoreCriteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchFord Credit Auto Owner Trust 2016-C -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889027Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013708ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1013708&flm_nm=15e_1013708_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1013708Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
