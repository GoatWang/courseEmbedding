Audubon Adventures has been greeted enthusiastically by school administrators, teachers, and especially by the kids, who can take home four issues of an environmental newspaper, and in their classroom see videos and interact with other schoolchildren across the country via the Internet. The current Audubon Adventures resource kit includes a complete teaching resource for teachers and youth leaders working with school children ages 8 to 11, with 32 copies of four different newsletters, and spotlights various nature themes, The all-new kit spotlights various nature themes, including Wings and Things: Bats, Bees, Backyard Nesting Birds, Bills & Beaks, Feathers and Feet. Washington Crossing Audubon Society is the local chapter of the National Audubon Society in Central New Jersey, with over 1500 members, and is a non-profit 501(c)3 volunteer environmental group funded by membership contributions and outside donations. WCAS actively seeks to expand environmental education to people of all ages in Central New Jersey, which range from holding monthly program meetings and field trips open to the public, to symposia for local organizations and corporations.

Cytosolic Phospholipase A 2 Shows Burst Kinetics Consistent with the Slow, Reversible Formation of a Dead-End Complex

            Guenther, Matthew G.; Witmer, Mark R.; Burke, James R.
        

            Cytosolic phospholipase A 2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn -2 ester of arachidonate-containing phospholipids. In the present research, a “burst” of arachidonate which precedes a somewhat slower, linear rate ( v ) of product formation was observed and characterized using covesicles of 1,2-dimyristoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphomethanol (DMPM) containing <10 mol% 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrate. The magnitude of the burst (π) was enzyme dependent, in both the presence and absence of glycerol. Upon subsequent addition of enzyme after the primary burst was complete, a second burst of arachidonate production was observed. This is consistent with the effect resulting from an enzyme effect and not from changes in the substrate. The use of 1,2-dioleoyl- sn -glycero-3-phosphomethanol as the carrier phospholipid instead of DMPM greatly reduced the rate of hydrolysis without a large effect on the π/ v ratio, consistent with the burst not being the result of limitations in the lateral diffusion rate of phospholipids within the covesicles. When the assay is performed in the presence of glycerol, the burst phenomenon was also observed with the monoarachidonoyl glycerol transacylase product which shows that the effect occurs through a common mechanism. The burst and subsequent linear rate of hydrolysis are highly temperature dependent, with a pronounced increase in the π/ v ratio as the temperature is increased from 35 to 45°C. A mechanism in which a slow equilibrium between an active and less active (inactive) state of substrate-bound enzyme is proposed. This may provide a means by which the enzyme is switched off after a few hundred turnovers in order to prevent unabated phospholipid hydrolysis in cells which may be deleterious to membrane integrity.

The arachidonate product can serve as the sub-strate for the lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases toproduce eicosanoids (for a review, see Ref. 4). The en-zyme is normally located in the cytosol, but translo-cates to the membrane in response to submicromolarconcentrations of calcium (5, 6). Moreover, it has beenproposed that agonist-induced phosphorylation ofcPLA2(at Ser-505, among others) is involved in theactivation of the enzyme in vivo (7–9).There is considerable evidence that cPLA2acts as aserine esterase such that an acyl enzyme intermediateis formed between arachidonate and an active siteserine residue. Site-directed mutagenesis has beenused to identify serine-228 as the putative active sitenucleophile (10, 11). Other evidence for this mecha-nism is that the enzyme also catalyzes, to a smallextent, a transacylase reaction which is most simplyexplained by invoking an acyl enzyme intermediate(12, 13). Additionally, the arachidonoyltriﬂuoromethylketone, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme,shows kinetic and NMR spectroscopic characteristics1To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be ad-dressed at Bristol–Myers Squibb, P.O.

Welcome to Witmer Products
































Witmer Products,
                Inc. had its origin decades ago when founder and current
                president Robert N. Witmer demonstrated an early tendency to fabricate
                various useful items for applications in homes, agriculture, and
                at several non-profit community centers where he was employed
                for thirty-five years. His first commercial venture was launched
                in June of 1994 at a family outing on the east coast when he realized
                the need for a durable, non-rusting polymer auger to fasten beach
                umbrellas into the sand. His Sport Anchor version was subsequently
                designed, placed on the U.S. market in 1995, and managed by wife
                Waunita Witmer. As sales grew, the enterprise
          was incorporated in March of 2000. 

    A second product was developed in 2001 as Robert noted the tendency for daily
    newspapers to become damp in the familiar plastic holders which line the
    rural countryside. A clear, flexible vinyl flap and clip was designed to
    seal out
    the weather elements and reduce the need for the carrier to insert each newspaper
    in a protective plastic bag. This item is currently being distributed through
    a national newspaper supply company. 

    A third product was initially designed for the extended Witmer family, who are
    long-time users of natural peanut butter. Robert particularly worked closely
    with the patriarch of the family, Daniel A. Witmer, grandfather of twenty-eight,
    to refine a useful device to mix the separated oils that naturally occur in non-hydrogenated
    peanut butter. As a tribute to his love of mechanical innovations, hard work,
    and involvement in this project, the consumer item was named “Grandpa Witmer’s” Old
    Fashioned Peanut Butter Mixer, and is sold through the R.N.Witmer Company.

    It is the desire of the Witmer Companies to continue providing innovative,
    affordable consumer items that help to address common problems with simple
    solutions. We sincerely hope you will be pleased with our products and services.
