SANTA ANA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Carrington 
      Holding Company, LLC (Carrington) has appointed real estate industry 
      leader, Steve Ozonian, as its Chief Real Estate Officer. In his new 
      role, Ozonian will serve as a member of Carrington’s executive 
      leadership team and will lead the portfolio of Carrington’s real estate 
      affiliates, including Atlantic 
      & Pacific Real Estate, LLC, Carrington 
      Property Services, LLC, White 
      Van Real Estate Services, L.P., Atlantic & Pacific Escrow, Inc., and 
      Atlantic & Pacific Settlement Services, LLC.
    


      “Steve brings an impressive track record of success and a singular focus 
      on the future of the real estate industry,” said Bruce Rose, Founder and 
      Chief Executive Officer, Carrington 
      Holding Company. “We are very pleased to have him lead the growth of 
      this business for Carrington.”
    

      Ozonian adds significant industry experience to Carrington’s real estate 
      portfolio. Previously, Ozonian led the growth and development of several 
      major real estate companies and operations. As a Senior Executive at 
      Chicago Title & Trust, he headed the real estate services segment which 
      acquired and sold thousands of homes a year. As an Executive Vice 
      President with Coldwell Banker, Ozonian helped build the business into a 
      national company by creating a major relocation company and growing it 
      to more than 70,000 sales associates and managing a vast portfolio of 
      REO and corporate homes. With Prudential Real Estate Services, Ozonian, 
      as Chairman and CEO, expanded annual sales volume to more than $200 
      billion. Ozonian also served as CEO of REALTOR.com, creating the world’s 
      most successful real estate search portal, and served Bank of America as 
      its National Homeownership Executive.
    

      This record of success will enable Ozonian to play a key role in the 
      expansion of Carrington’s

Tree.com, parent company of online mortgage giant LendingTree.com, has appointed Steve Ozonian as the first CEO of its Real Estate.com division, the company announced today.
RealEstate.com operates a national property search site and RealEstate.com, Realtors, a company-owned brokerage business with more than 800 sales agents.
Ozonian’s appointment is effective immediately. He had been executive chairman of Global Mobility Solutions, a relocation support company, since 2005. 
A 25-year real estate industry veteran, Ozonian has also held positions as a senior executive   at RE/MAX International Inc., chairman and CEO of Prudential Real Estate Services, CEO of    Realtor.com, national homeownership executive of Bank of America, and CEO and board chairman at Help-U-Sell Real Estate. He has been a member of Tree.com’s board of directors since 2008.
"Steve has been a tremendous asset to us as a Tree.com board  member and I’m thrilled he’ll be leading our RealEstate.com business,"  said Doug Lebda, chairman and CEO of Tree.com, in a statement. 
"His diverse experience in  all key components of the homeownership process, both online and offline, make  him a natural fit to lead the company. His vision for providing brokers and  agents with a more economically sustainable real estate model will  revolutionize the industry and provide consumers with a superior homebuying  and selling experience."Win and close more buyers with an exclusive mortgage productPartner with a brokerage that packages buyer rebates with discounted loans READ MORE
With Ozonian’s appointment, the company also announced a change in RealEstate.com’s business model. The company will create its first franchising opportunity — a trademark license company that will allow agents and brokers to license the Real Estate.com brand. The new model will allow them to "take advantage of lower costs and greater  flexibility than found in a traditional franchise arrangement," the announcement said.
The company also plans to include resources from Tree.com and LendingTree.com on the RealEstate.com site, including tips and tools like payment calculators and ways to connect with direct lenders to make the homebuying experience more seamless for consumers, according to a spokesperson. The company has not yet decided how it will implement that change. 
"The powerful combination of Tree.com, LendingTree and RealEstate.com  offers a unique and valuable proposition for both consumers and real estate  professionals," Ozonian said in a statement. "This new model positions RealEstate.com  as an industry trailblazer, providing more flexibility for brokers given  current economic conditions while simultaneously offering a more integrated  approach for homebuyers and sellers in today’s market."
