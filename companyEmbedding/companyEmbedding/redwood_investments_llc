Michael Wood :: Redwood Investments LLC
Michael M. Wood is Chairman of Redwood Investments LLC, a Washington, DC investment company concentrating in media, real estate, and alternative energy (www.redwoodinvestments.net). In recent years the firm has made multiple  investments in these target categories. Wood serves on the Board of Directors of KB Home (press release).
From 2006-2009 Wood was US Ambassador to Sweden where he made cooperation between the U.S. and Sweden in alternative energy technology his top priority. During his three year term he traveled to all 21 län (counties) looking for alternative energy companies that could benefit from cooperation with American venture capital and research institutions. The US Embassy’s list of the best of these Swedish companies contained 52 firms and the resulting volume of activity between Swedish firms and US interests was $150-200MM. 
In recognition for this work, on May 4, 2009 the King of Sweden bestowed on Wood the insignia of Commander Grand Cross, Order of the Polar Star, a medal given by Sweden’s Royal Family to people of foreign birth who make significant contributions to Sweden. 
Prior to becoming ambassador, Wood was co-founder and CEO of Hanley Wood LLC, the leading media company in the construction industry and one of the ten largest business-to-business media companies in the U.S.
Wood and private equity sponsor Veronis Suhler Stevenson sold Hanley Wood to JPMorgan Partners (now CCMP Capital) on August 1, 2005 and at that time he left the company and its board to become ambassador. 
In addition to his investing activities at Redwood, Wood is on the Board of Trustees for The American-Scandinavian Foundation in New York and the Board of Directors of Capital Partners for Education in Washington, DC.
Wood grew up in Flint, Michigan and graduated from Yale in 1969. On June 13, 2009 he received an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters, from Kettering University in Flint for his work as ambassador. 
Wood enjoys biking and golf. He and his wife Judy have two grown children, Mike and Kim, and 8 grandchildren. The family lives in Washington, DC and Rehoboth, Delaware.

We look for businesses with the following characteristics:


Understandable, durable business model with a proven earnings track record

Important Disclosures: 

Mutual Funds involve risk including the possible loss of principal. Redwood's Mutual Funds or an Underlying Fund may use leverage, such as borrowing money to purchase securities or the use of derivatives, will indirectly cause additional expenses and magnify gains or losses. Derivative instruments involve risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. There is a risk that issuers and counterparties will not make payments on securities and other investments, resulting in losses.

Investments in foreign securities could subject the Redwood Mutual Funds to greater risks including, currency fluctuation, economic conditions, and different governmental and accounting standards. In addition to the risks generally associated with investing in securities of foreign companies, countries with emerging markets also may have relatively unstable governments, social and legal systems that do not protect shareholders, economies based on only a few industries, and securities markets that trade a small number of issues.  Adverse changes in currency exchange rates may erode or reverse any potential gains from Redwood Mutual Funds' investments. Non-diversification risk may result in Redwood Mutual Funds being more vulnerable to events affecting a single issuer.

If a Fund invests in other investment companies, including ETFs, they will bear additional expenses based on its pro rata share of the other investment companyâs or ETFâs operating expenses, including the potential duplication of management fees. The risk of owning an ETF generally reflects the risks of owning the underlying investments the ETF holds. Redwood Mutual Funds may use model-based strategies that, while historically effective, may not be successful on an ongoing basis or could contain unknown errors. In addition, the data used in models may be inaccurate.

The Redwood Managed Volatility Portfolio is an Investment vehicle for variable annuity contracts and may be subject to fees or expenses that are typically charged by these contracts. Please review the insurance contract prospectus for further description of these fees and expenses. This product is available as a sub-account investment to a variable life insurance policy only and is not offered directly to the general public.


Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Redwood Mutual Funds. This and other important information about the Redwood Mutual Funds are contained in the prospectuses, which can be obtained by calling 1-855-RED-FUND (733-3863). The prospectuses should be read carefully before investing. The Redwood Mutual Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, Member 
FINRA/
SIPC. Redwood Investment Management, 
LLC is not affiliated with Northern Lights Distributors, LLC. 5200-NLD-03/22/2017.
