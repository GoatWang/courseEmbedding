Meet Ms. Bell Hello parents, students, & curious visitors!  My name is Ms. Jana Brumbelow Bell, and I have the distinct pleasure of serving students at Calhoun Middle School as a special education teacher.   This is my seventeenth year in public education, all of which I am proud to say have been with Calhoun Middle School.  I graduated from Shorter University with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology.  After being afforded the opportunity to integrate my background with the field of education I completed an add-on degree certification in Special Education from the University of Georgia.  I also hold a Master's in Special Education from Grand Canyon University.  I have a special interest and have received specialized training with Autism Spectrum Disorders too.  I am a proud mother of two children, one of which is a student in Calhoun City Schools and one who is a graduate. As a matter of fact, I myself am a product of our legendary school system!  I love reading, technology, & spending time with my family.  I am passionate about education & the children I teach.  For those with children whom I will have the privilege to teach I thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with your child.  I am excited about the coming school year, and  I encourage you to contact me at your convenience to discuss your child's education. Class Introduction I am excited to be teaching in our self-contained classroom this year and look forward to helping and watching my students grow and succeed.  Together we will focus on academics that align with Georgia’s academic standards along with functional skills and community-based instruction.  We will integrate academics with pertinent life-skills to help our students grow, succeed, & attain a greater level of independence. Looking forward to a GREAT year!Ms. Bell   Education Bachelor of Arts in PsychologyShorter UniversityAdd-on Certification Degree in Special EducationUniversity of GeorgiaMasters of Education in Special EducationGrand Canyon UniversityValid Georgia Certificate in Special Education (P-12) as a Highly Qualified Educator in the Special Education Fields of Language Arts, Math, Science, & Social Studies, Grades P-5 & 4-8.  **OUR MISSION AT CALHOUN CITY SCHOOLS IS TO INSPIRE ALL STUDENTS TO BECOME LIFE-LONG LEARNERS IN THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE**

 RANDOLPH, MN                                            





                        I'm not sure how to even start this. Usually people don't write their own story for these but I think I will be the best one to do it with all honesty.I'm 34 years old,  mother of my 10 year old Gracie Ann , and i want to live,  Live like no other! I have been fighting stage 3 breast cancer for 30 months, I'm now stage 4 terminal with little time left.  Nothing I mean nothing has went right from the start!Diagnosis,  lab errors, mastectomy,  chemo, radiation, lymphedema diagnosis, then surgery which I was burned on accident 2nd-3rd degree three half dollar sizes burns on my arm. I spent my whole summer doing wound care on my already disabled arm which kept me the whole summer from doing what I should of been doing. So from going from all of that to finally healing and getting to go back to work after 30 months. I worked a total of 6 days before my reconstruction. Days later after reconstruction I couldn't walk or hold my bladder! My oncologist ordered a PET Scan a week right before Thanksgiving. What we saw was unbelieveable! So bad she wanted to admit me that night. I'm like hell no I'm going home to my family. The cancer has spread to most of my organs and bones. I'm still shocked I'm alive by just hearing statistic and time given to live, it's all so scary. Then 3 weeks later my breast leaking and getting infected and them having to cut it off again! Literally cut it off! And leave 1! I wanted both removed, my last freaking wish and they would only take 1. So my reasoning for the go fund me  is to get me  out of bed to live the rest of my days traveling to see friends and family. I would also  love a wedding reception. And a honneymoon.  (Pay bills, funeral costs, gas, medical supplies) and all that other stuff nobody wants to think about when they are dying. I never expected the end of my life to be like this. I have always been a hard worker and managed my money well. Been a good, honest,loving person. U just never think something so horrible could happen to oursrlves. I also want to talk about Gracie. If we don't get on our  road trip across the country spreading our love and smiles to everyone, I want the donations to go to a college fund for her. I could go on and on about the things I'm going to miss out on, it's all so devisting.  I'm really bad at asking for things, but this time I need your help, and I know if you don't ask you don't recieve. Any little bit helps.Thanks Everyone,Love,Jana and Gracie507313089628453 Rochester BlvdRandolph MN 55065

We said goodbye to our baby April 2nd.  Jana came to us on November 29th, 1980 as the fourth of our kids and sister to Pete (Nichole), Craig (Krista) and Brant (Mayra).  
Jana has always been in charge of nearly everything.  Those that were really close came to know her as "boss".  She was smart enough to get away with it.  Most of the teachers at Randolph needed a sabbatical after pushing Jana to graduate.  
Jana loved and reinvented all forms of fun. She had fun, smiled every day and encouraged everyone around her to do the same.  She was a social creature and loved all of her many local jobs, clientele and employers.
Jana loved to eat good food and realized early the difference between food and good food.  This developed into a passion for cooking.
Jana left behind Nick Okeson.  Lover, friend, companion and husband.
Gracie Vidal.  Her beautiful, artistic, 11 year old prankster daughter.
Jana touched many people and changed many lives across the country as she traveled with her family near the end. 
Jana would want you to be with us at her celebration of life as a survivor.
This Saturday April 16th.  3:00 to 8:00 PM.  MILL STREET TAVERN  Cannon Falls, MN.
Be there or be square.  Bring your smiley face and be ready to share a story.
Mom and Dad

She knew that she was formed by God's hands, dreamed up in His heart and placed in this world for a purpose.

At 3:45am today, Saturday, April 2, 2016, Jana Leigh Bell left this world with the same strength, courage and grace that she lived for the past 35 years.  God truly had a special purpose for Jana.  Right up until the end she continued to touch and inspire everyone around her with her honesty, her openness, her unrelenting passion for life and her love for her family and friends.  If Jana touched or inspired you, as I'm sure she did, take something you learned from her and carry it forward in your life.  Just imagine a world full of goodness.....because of Jana Leigh Bell!  We love you Jana and look forward to the day when we are all together again.

(Jana wrote this post earlier this week and asked that I share it once she was gone)
Now this one's for Gracie my 11 year old daughter. We never went out and spent any money on frivolous things we bought a RV and traveled the country side making the best memories to ever be told. We ate like kings and queens for the last year well besides me being absolutely sick but I still was able to cook and eat most of the time. 

long story short, I was 3 diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in September 2012, wow that's almost 4 years ago!  Surgery, more surgery, chemo, radiation more radiation, lymphedema, botched surgery, infections to be told my cancer has spread to my whole body, to pain pump to 4 blood patches on my spine, chemo, to port, to Belly Asities now to the end. I did it all and my daughter stayed strong the whole time. Nothing went right, only the people that wanted to help!

My parents will be taking over Gracie Ann. But I really wanted to do something for my daughter. I need all your help! I want her to be able to go to college her first year with paid expenses. Can you help make this happen? She's a great kid and is going to make this world a better place.

Hugs to all and thank you for your help. 

I'm a mother of a daughter that's smart and strong, she had a great future ahead  of herself. I pray this account keeps going and she can continue to flourish in school without her mom.  I promice her a Disney trip that hasn't been taken, I don't know if I'll ever make it but maybe someone else could. 

I love you all!  Jana

***A Celebration of Life will be held in a couple weeks.  Information will be posted once the details are finalized.

Hey Everyone, I have been struggling with bladder infection I'm not sure how many more updates I'll be doing. My bladders not fully dumping and the fluid in by belly area has to be drained 2 to 3 time's a day. I had a port put in my stomach so my mom can do it at home vs going to hospital in Rochester. Its crazy we get about 1,000 ml at a time! She's a pro now. We are on day 4. My livers shot and I'm not sure what's going on with my kidneys but 1 falls apart they all start falling apart. I'm not peeing much 93 lbs, yikes I about died seeing that number scary!  
I couldn't of done it without my Dad, Mom and Chris, I would of died without them in the past few months. Also all the people that brought food, never thought id be ok to except food as i love cooking. And everyone's love and support!  
I have been off the all medication for weeks now! so my heads clear, I feel more coherent, alive, myself and not all steroided out, shaking, waiting for them to exit my body. Its great to have my head back even if my body doesnt survive. So even if it's for a short period I think I have done pretty darn good. We have called hospice in, really it's up to the big man and me. Days, weeks months. But I can tell you this shits getting hard, and tiring.
Today I'm up and walking!!! No stairs and up for a few minutes at a time, I'm super exhausted after walking. My main thing now is to gain muscle, it was eaten up by the infections. Oh and get rid of this nausea! 

Besides that, were all doing good, well I can only account for my myself, the rest will tell you thenselves. It's starting to warm up and the sun is shining. I take it day by day, home is where the heart is <3
I have been spending all my time with Gracie, she's been such a great help. Girls just want to have fun! 
Love you all,
JanaLeigh Bell
I love a good kiss

Praying for you and your family to be comforted by the angels and held in peace. I instantly felt connected to you when I started reading your posts and since have been closely following your journey having my own friends who in the past year have been taken by cancer. I pray for you and your family. Your journey and what you have been through and your attitude through it all has been truly amazing. You are an amazing person and I am sure you and your family already knows this but I just want you to know that I know this too as do so many other people out here following your journey! Bless you and your family and thank you!

You are such an inspiration!!! I have been following your story from the beginning, but have never reached out to say how much you have touched my heart.  No matter how bad things get, or how much pain I know you must be in, you keep smiling. Your spirit shines through it all and you bless everyone - even those of us who have never had the privilege of meeting you - with your words, pictures and endless love for your family, friends and life!

I've been following your posts and want you to know I'm thinking about you.  You provide such a great perspective and help me remember to take nothing for granted.  This will be a very tough time with radiation but remember that you are in many people's thoughts. You're truly an inspiration and a helpful reminder of what's truly important in this life.  Hugs.

I met Jana and her family when they came in the Early Bird for dinner last night. What a up beat friendly woman. Then she shared her story and my heart broke a little. Read and share Jana's story about her trip across the country, making lifetime memories for them all and ticking off some of Jana's bucket list.

I think we believe for the impossible and that's when our faith takes place, I believe God made everything for a reason and I am sure he also created medicines for everything. There are some people doing treatments with Baking Soda and the leafs of this fruit called soursop ( where to be found in South-America and maybe central America). My grandpa has cancer but he changed his diet to vegan and since the cancer has reduced dramatically.  I hope this info could help. You still have time to turn this page into a miracle.  Blessings

Everyone! I mean everyone you are all so amazing. Yesterday was my last chemo round and of course sick today. But I had a old friend Matt send me 4 water park of America passes and I needed to use them asap. So Gracie, 2 new friends Ava and Rachelle and I went this evening. The moment I got up at 3 showered and was gone by 5 all my sickness had left, of course comes and goes but the excitement of  it all made me forget about all the pain and nausea. Good thing for friends, water parks, non alcoholic drinks and little girls. God bless all of you, u truly have made my life so much more full!
