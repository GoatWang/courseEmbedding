Palm Beach State College President Ava L. Parker leads Palm Beach County’s largest
                  higher education institution with a strategic approach emphasizing innovation, student

                  community college. Growing with the county, the College now offers more than 130 programs
                  of study, including bachelor’s and associate degrees, professional certificates and

                  Governors of the State University System and served on the University of Central Florida’s
                  Board of Trustees. She was a partner in the Jacksonville law firm of Lawrence & Parker,

Ava L. Parker selected to serve as Palm Beach State College's fifth presidentPrivacy Policy





After a six-month national search, the Palm Beach State College District Board of Trustees has unanimously chosen Ava L. Parker as the college's fifth president, making her the first woman to hold the position.Parker is expected to start by July 1 and will succeed Dennis Gallon, who is retiring June 30 after 18 years as president."The quality of the programs and the commitment of the academic and administrative teams are apparent in the success of this institution," Parker said in a news release. "We will do great things together."A third-generation Floridian, Parker earned her Juris Doctor degree and a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism from the University of Florida. She joined Florida Polytechnic University in 2012 and currently serves as the university's executive vice president and chief operating officer.Parker also served on the Board of Governors of the State University System for 10 years, and she is a partner with the Jacksonville-based law firm Lawrence & Parker.Carolyn L. Williams, trustee and co-chair of the Presidential Search Committee, said interest in the position was intense, with 161 applications received from throughout the United States and abroad. The 15-member committee narrowed the pool to four finalists, including Parker.
