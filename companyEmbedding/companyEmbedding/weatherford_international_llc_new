	Why Weatherford



	We may be a large company, but we empower our team to create fresh ideas that challenge convention and break the status quo. Our employees are the key to driving our growth and success. Everywhere we operate, they are inspired to develop new and efficient ways of raising the bar to meet the needs of an evolving industry and solve our clients’ toughest challenges.

	Our entrepreneurial spirit is evident in how we approach challenges and how we share resources with co-workers. While everyone at Weatherford is empowered to innovate and create new solutions, by collaborating with their colleagues across groups and across borders, these ideas are made stronger and brought to reality sooner.

Here are a few ways you can become engaged in our dynamic culture: 









Field Engineers and Technicians – We look for individuals with backgrounds in science, technology, and engineering to support our key field and technical roles. You receive focused training relative to products, services, and solutions that will support continued career growth and personal development as you work side-by-side with fellow employees and our clients. We also offer rotational career paths that foster technical, business, and leadership skills and provide soft skills training to further develop your strengths.







					 



Experienced Professionals –We enhance the skillsets of our people and value the experience, knowledge, and different perspectives you bring to our business. We want to take that to the next level.
					 If you have experience in one or more of our many product lines, or in the oil and gas industry in general, and would like to be part of our team, your skill set could be a good match for our continued growth.







					 



Research and Development Engineers and Scientists – Do you enjoy solving complex challenges? The top-notch technical personnel in our R&D facilities around the world are responsible for sustaining our leading technology portfolio and developing new ways of doing things to continue developing the advanced and highly reliable equipment that our field teams run.







					 



Functional and Support Positions – Every role in Weatherford plays a key part in our continued success. We are looking for hard working, flexible people within the fields of Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Legal, Finance, Information Technology, Marketing, and Human Resources that have a strong focus on collaborative teamwork and will enjoy supporting something much larger than what they can see at hand. At Weatherford, you will find many opportunities for growth and advancement.




				  



				 

				 




	No experience in the oilfield? Just graduated?

	Weatherford offers the individuals with diverse backgrounds the opportunity to transfer and develop their skillsets into a successful career in the oil and gas industry. 

Below are a few of our focused global initiatives. 







.



University Graduates and NextGen – As a university graduate, you will be given the knowledge, tools and mentorship needed to create a successful career through a variety of talent development programs, including formal training to develop and enhance technical and non-technical, individual and business acumen skill sets.  For example, graduate engineers may qualify for our NextGen program, a global rotational leadership development program designed to accelerate technical and soft-skill development to prepare them for future leadership positions. No matter the program, you will be challenged to expand upon what you learned at university and contribute to our forward thinking team as we challenge convention in all areas of our industry. 









Building a Globally Diverse Workforce – We understand the value of diverse perspectives and put an emphasis on nationalization and representation across the globe. We strategically hire in key markets, including Saudi Arabia, to build a workforce that is well positioned to meet the needs of an ever-evolving industry.









Military Veterans – As a military veteran, you have experience, skills, and leadership abilities that fit in perfectly with a multitude of roles – including operational, technical, or management positions. We need individuals that embrace team work, safety, and dedication to the mission. Weatherford wants to assist you in your transition to the energy industry, and help you make this next career move a success.

Weatherford International Press Release
WEATHERFORD AND CURTRAN SIGN LONG-TERM CONTRACT FOR NEW LITEWIRE™  NANOTECHNOLOGY 
Weatherford Gains Exclusivity of Nanotube Wire and Cable Products in the Oil and Gas Industry
HOUSTON – April 08, 2014 – Weatherford International Ltd. today announced that it has entered into an agreement with CurTran LLC to use, sell, and distribute LiteWire, the first commercial scale production of a carbon nanotube technology in wire and cable form. 
“With LiteWire products, we gain exclusivity to a revolutionary technology that will greatly add value to our business,” said Dharmesh Mehta, chief operating officer for Weatherford. “The use of LiteWire products allows us to provide safer, faster, and more economic solutions for our customers.”
In addition to using LiteWire in its global operations, Weatherford will be the exclusive distributor of this product in the oil and gas industry. 
“Weatherford is an ideal first customer for LiteWire because the oil and gas industry is the most demanding arena for any cable product,” said Gary Rome, chief executive officer and president of CurTran. “It is a long-term contract with a forecasted average value of more than $350 million per year.”
 
CurTran manufactures LiteWire, carbon nanotube conductors in wire form that are now becoming available to the commercial market for the first time. LiteWire can be utilized anywhere a metallic conductor is used, and in places where metals cannot go.  
“There hasn’t been any real innovation to replace copper wire in the last hundred years until now,” added Rome. “LiteWire is a sustainable, lighter and stronger technology that combines the electrical and mechanical aspects of wire and cable into one product.”

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
