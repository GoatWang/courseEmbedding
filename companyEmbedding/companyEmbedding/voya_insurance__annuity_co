Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

You should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges, and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. The prospectuses for the variable annuity and underlying investment options contain this and other information. You may obtain free prospectuses by calling your financial professional or 800-366-0066. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing.
Variable annuities are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (Des Moines, IA) and distributed by Directed Services LLC. Both are members of the Voya® family of companies.
A variable annuity is a long-term investment designed for retirement planning. It is a contract between you and an insurance company, under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you. Additionally, variable annuities offer the opportunity to allocate premiums among fixed and variable investment options that have the potential to grow income tax-deferred, until an income stream begins. These payments, called annuity income, will begin either immediately or at a future date and a part of which may be the return of your premium or principal. This income is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.
Variable annuities are subject to investment risk, are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. In addition, there is no guarantee that any variable investment option will meet its stated objective.
IRAs and other qualified plans already provide tax deferral like that provided by an annuity. Additional features and benefits such as contract guarantees, death benefits and the ability to receive a lifetime income are contained within the annuity for a cost. Please be sure the features and costs of the annuity are right for you when considering the purchase of the annuity. Neither the company nor its agents or representatives can provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor about your specific circumstances. The contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity products.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of  Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its polices.   





1Withdrawals may be subject to Federal/State income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% Federal penalty tax.

 Product Fact Sheet








Benefits



Easy Access+

Payments Can Be Sent to a Third Party
Payments can be automatically sent to single or multiple third parties, and used to pay certain expenses. Payments are still considered taxable.

Direct Deposit
Payments can be sent as a direct deposit to your client’s checking or savings accounts.


Protection Options+

Protection for Your Survivors
With the exception of the Life Payment Plan payout option, which ceases payments upon death, all other payout options allow for a beneficiary to receive any remaining benefits due.

Guaranteed Income
Unless the Increasing Payment Plan or Joint Life option is selected, the amount and frequency of the payments will never change.


Payout Options+


Voya SPIA offers a wide variety of payout options as well as a choice of monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual payment schedules.
Life Payment Plan with Joint Survivor with Period Certain
Payments until the first death with minimum payment period guaranteed (5-20 years). Following the guaranteed payment period, the payment amount could change based on which annuitant dies first.

Life Payment Plan with Period Certain
Payments for a lifetime with a minimum payment period (5-20 years).

Life Payment Plan with Joint Survivor
Payments until the first death, then amount paid could change based on which annuitant dies first.

Life Payment Plan with Cash Refund
Payments for a lifetime; at death, the purchase payment less applicable premium taxes received will be paid to the beneficiary as a lump sum payment.

Life Payment Plan with Installment Refund
Payments until the later date of death, or until the sum of payments equal the purchase payment, less applicable premium taxes.

Life Payment Plan
Payments for a lifetime, ceasing at death. Payments received may not equal initial premium.

Joint and Last Survivor
Guaranteed regular payments for the owner’s lifetime and the lifetime of another person, such as their spouse. Payments may reduce upon first death.

Joint and Last Survivor with Period Certain
Payments for the owner’s lifetime and the lifetime of another person with a minimum payment period (5-20 years). Once the payout option is chosen, payments are guaranteed for the amount and duration described in the annuity contract.

Increasing Payment Plan Option
To help adjust for inflation, the Increasing Payment Plan option can be added to Voya SPIA. Your client can select annual payment increases of 3% on life contingent contracts or 6% on period certain contracts. For Joint Life payment plan options with increasing income, 100% to survivor must be chosen. The increasing rate is compounded annually regardless of frequency selected.






Eligibility and Premiums



Issue Ages+

35-80 Period  Certain contracts can be purchased between the ages of 0 and 100.


Premium+

Single premium immediate
Minimum premium of $15,000
Maximum premium of $2,000,000 without prior home office approval


Tax Advantages+

Retirement Plan Distributions
Payments are fully taxable and will also be subject to an additional 10% federal penalty tax if received before age 59½, unless an exception applies. However, since these payments are made over time, tax liability is spread out over time as well. Deferring payments can place your clients in lower tax bracket at the time of these payouts, for lower income tax rates.

Partially-Taxable Payments
Only the interest portion of an annuity payment from a non-qualified annuity is taxable. The difference between the total annuity payment and the excludable amount is subject to federal income tax and, if applicable, state income tax. This partial exclusion from income tax continues until the principal is recovered, at which point the annuity payments are fully taxable.


Additional Details+

Annuities are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, a member of the Voya® family of companies.
Contract Form Series: 1823
All guarantees are based upon the financial strength and claims-paying ability of Voya Insurance and Annuity Company, which is solely responsible for all obligations under its contracts.
This is a summary only. Read the contract for complete details.
The product and its features may not be available in all states and are subject to change. Withdrawals may be subject to Federal/State income tax and, if taken prior to age 591 ⁄2, an additional 10% Federal penalty tax.
All distributions from qualified annuities may be taxable. State premium taxes may reduce the final value of your annuity.
IRAs and other qualified plans already provide tax-deferral like that provided by an annuity. Additional features and benefits such as contract guarantees, death benefits and the ability to receive a lifetime income are contained within the annuity for a cost. Please be sure the features and costs of the annuity are right for your clients when considering the purchase of the annuity.
Neither the company nor its agents or representatives can provide tax, legal or accounting advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor about your specific circumstances. Immediate annuities have no cash value, cannot be surrendered, and provide only the benefit described in the contract.

Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.  



















Annuity contracts are issued by Voya Insurance and Annuity Company (VIAC) (Des Moines, IA) or Voya Retirement, Insurance and Annuity Company (VRIAC) (Windsor, CT). Registered annuities are distributed by Directed Services LLC. All are members of the Voya™ family of companies.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the respective issuing company.

This is a summary only. Read the contract for complete details.
The product and its features may not be available in all states and are subject to change. All increases related to the guarantees and any index-linked growth increase your benefit value, which is used to determine your income withdrawal amount and do not increase your account value.  This product is not designed for accumulation of assets.
All withdrawals reduce the death benefit and may reduce the value of any optional benefits. Early withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts may be subject to ordinary income tax, a surrender charge, and if taken prior to age 59½, an IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax unless an exception applies. 
The contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity products. Annuity income is defined as a series of periodic payments, a part of which may be return of your premium or principal, which is guaranteed by the issuing insurance company for a specified period of time or for the life of the annuitant.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
