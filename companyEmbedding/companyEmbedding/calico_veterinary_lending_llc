3We group similar merchant category codes into Purchase Categories that are used to calculate the stated rewards points. We make every effort to include all relevant merchant category codes in the listed Purchase Categories. However, even though a merchant or the items that it sells may appear to fit within a Purchase Category, the merchant may not provide us with the merchant code that will fall within that Purchase Category. Because of this, we cannot guarantee that a purchase will qualify for more than the standard 1 (one) rewards points as any purchase where a merchant uses a category code outside of the eligible Purchase Category does not qualify for additional rewards points.
4Upon approval, you will receive a letter acknowledging your new account. The Rewards Bonus period begins on the date of the new account letter and ends 90 days later.

As your veterinary practice grows and thrives, you may want to consider the next steps to expand the footprint of your clinic. A ground-up construction project is a great way to grow your practice and invest in your future. Our team has funded over 2,394,000 square feet of veterinary construction projects and can help you build a new facility that benefits your business and your clients.
Live Oak will review your practice’s financial history to let you know how much debt your business can support. You want your new building to increase business, not stress your cash flow. That’s why we offer up to 25 year loan terms that improve cash flow and allow for lower monthly payments.





Throughout the construction process, we’ll work directly with you and your contractor to ensure the work is done properly and the project is completed on time and within budget. And we’ll stay by your side until the first four-legged friend walks through your new doors.





A New Leash on Life: Veterinary Acquisition
Another way to grow your business or become a practice owner is by acquiring an existing veterinary practice. Live Oak offers financing for the acquisition of the business as well as the real estate.
Just like your clients want an experienced veterinarian for the life of their pet, you’ll want a lender who is seasoned in practice acquisitions and dedicated to your long-term success. Live Oak will guide you through the loan process and provide resources to ensure a successful transition—even after the loan closes.


To get started making your veterinary aspirations a reality, please provide the following:

Personal financial statement
Personal resume
Current profit/loss statement from the practice
Business tax returns for the past three years


If you have questions about your next steps to a thriving future, contact our team.

3We group similar merchant category codes into Purchase Categories that are used to calculate the stated rewards points. We make every effort to include all relevant merchant category codes in the listed Purchase Categories. However, even though a merchant or the items that it sells may appear to fit within a Purchase Category, the merchant may not provide us with the merchant code that will fall within that Purchase Category. Because of this, we cannot guarantee that a purchase will qualify for more than the standard 1 (one) rewards points as any purchase where a merchant uses a category code outside of the eligible Purchase Category does not qualify for additional rewards points.

Your Partner for Veterinary Practice Financing
Although Live Oak Bank now serves many types of small businesses nationwide, veterinarians were our first customers. In fact, we were founded as a lender focused solely on providing veterinary loans to veterinary practices.
Working with devoted veterinarians like you every day, we understand what it takes for your practice to grow and succeed. If you’re looking to begin a ground-up construction project, acquire a practice, refinance or make improvements, we’re the right lending partner to help you reach your goals. Live Oak’s loan process is simple and streamlined thanks to our innovative Live Oak Portal technology, which lets you complete your loan request online and see exactly where you are in the process at any time.

Let’s Build Your Dream Practice


2016 Veterinary Economics Hospital Design People’s Choice Award Winner

As your veterinary practice grows and thrives, you may want to consider the next steps to expand the footprint of your clinic. A ground-up construction project is a great way to grow your practice and invest in your future. Our team has funded over 2,394,000 square feet of veterinary construction projects and can help you build a new facility that benefits your business and your clients.
Live Oak will review your practice’s financial history to let you know how much debt your business can support. You want your new building to increase business, not stress your cash flow. That’s why we offer up to 25 year loan terms that improve cash flow and allow for lower monthly payments.





Throughout the construction process, we’ll work directly with you and your contractor to ensure the work is done properly and the project is completed on time and within budget. And we’ll stay by your side until the first four-legged friend walks through your new doors.





A New Leash on Life: Veterinary Acquisition
Another way to grow your business or become a practice owner is by acquiring an existing veterinary practice. Live Oak offers financing for the acquisition of the business as well as the real estate.
Just like your clients want an experienced veterinarian for the life of their pet, you’ll want a lender who is seasoned in practice acquisitions and dedicated to your long-term success. Live Oak will guide you through the loan process and provide resources to ensure a successful transition—even after the loan closes.


To get started making your veterinary aspirations a reality, please provide the following:

Personal financial statement
Personal resume
Current profit/loss statement from the practice
Business tax returns for the past three years


If you have questions about your next steps to a thriving future, contact our team.
