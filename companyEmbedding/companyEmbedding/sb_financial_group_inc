SB Financial Group Becomes Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. SB Financial Group Inc presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

SBFG Ex-Dividend Reminder - 2/8/17
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 2/8/17, SB Financial Group Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.065, payable on 2/24/17. As a percentage of SBFG's recent stock price of $18.86, this dividend works out to approximately 0.34%.
