Early Life & Education[edit]
Chau was born in 1961 as the daughter of a Hong Kong small time businessman. She attended the prestigious Diocesan Girls' School in Hong Kong, where was elected junior house captain. She sat the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination in 1978 and graduated in 1979. Upon her graduation, she went on to continue her education in Sydney, Australia at the University of New South Wales.[2][3]
Career[edit]
After living in Australia, Chau lived and worked in London during the 1980s for a short period of time. During the late 1980s, she befriended Debbie Chang, would eventually become one of her longest running business partners.
Chau's first notable achievement within Hong Kong business circles was winning a project to build the Oriental Square in downtown Beijing in 1993. This project, and many others during her early career were accomplished in involvement with former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, Debbie Chang's cousin. Chau also met Li Ka-shing around this time, and the two would later become known for their close companionship and various business partnerships.
In 1999, with Li's help, Chau set up Tom, a Chinese language media comopany, as a Cayman Island registered limited company as a minority (40%) partner together with Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings in a series of transactions which netted her an estimated USD 11 million in cash even before the company began to trade.[4] When Tom was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chau's investment in Tom grew to UCS$1.63 billion, making her the then second-richest woman in Hong Kong.[3]
In 2002, Chau invested RMB ￥ 1 million into an interactive voice-recognition service provider, Beijing Leitingwuji Network Technology Company Limited (北京雷霆无极网络科技有限公司).[5] In September 2003, before the company was even profitable, she sold it to TOM Group for the sum of USD132 million. Its subsidiary TOM Online was then separately listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early 2004.[4] Chau remained a 9.998% shareholder in Tom Online until 12 March 2007, when Tom Group announced an offer for the outstanding shares in Tom Online, to take the company private. Chau also has a 24% stake in TOM Group prior to the announcement.[6]
In 2002, Chau cofounded Horizons Ventures with Debbie Chang, who is the only person named as a director. Li Ka-shing only became an investor in the firm two years after its founding, but his backing as the richest man in Asia has helped the firm stand out above the crowd.[7] Under Chau, Horizons Ventures has invested over US$470 million in more than 80 tech companies, in search of "disruptive" tech entrepreneurs.[8] Its primary investments have been in the United States and Israel, with at least 28 investments in each country respectively since 2006.
Chau has personally stated that her business interests center around nurturing Western companies, viewing them as more innovative. Chau has been noted to invest in companies very quickly, sometimes within 24 hours of startup owners, or immediately after a short coffee meeting. Chau typically brings investments ranging anywhere from $1 million to $20 million to the table. Horizons was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2006. With her direction, the Li Ka-shing foundation has also invested in tech giants such as Facebook, Slack, and Spotify.[7]
She was named one of Forbes Asia's 50 Women in the Mix in 2013.[9] As of 2014, she is listed as the 81nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[10]
Personal life[edit]
Chau is well known for her decades long friendship with Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, who she met through a mutual friend in the 1990s. Li is 33 years her senior and is Chau's closest confidante, and the pair have backed and advised each other through many of their projects. Chau has been seen kneeling down in public to tie Li's shoelaces and holding his umbrella in the rain.[3] Chau has compared their relationship to that of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.[1]
In 2012, Chau sued Hong Kong distributor of Beijing-based Caijing under accusations of defamation, with the magazine having made claims of Chau accepting bribes from a mainland government official. Mainland courts ruled in December 2012 that Beijin Caijing Magazine Limited was liable for defamation and ordered the company to publish an apology. Chau's camp has accepted these terms.[11]

Chau has been noted to invest in companies very quickly, sometimes within 24 hours of startup owners, or immediately after a short coffee meeting. Chau typically brings investments ranging anywhere from $1 million to $20 million to the table. Horizons was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2006. With her direction, the Li Ka-shing foundation has also invested in tech giants such as Facebook, Slack, and Spotify.[7]
She was named one of Forbes Asia's 50 Women in the Mix in 2013.[9] As of 2014, she is listed as the 81nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[10]
Personal life[edit]
Chau is well known for her decades long friendship with Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, who she met through a mutual friend in the 1990s. Li is 33 years her senior and is Chau's closest confidante, and the pair have backed and advised each other through many of their projects. Chau has been seen kneeling down in public to tie Li's shoelaces and holding his umbrella in the rain.[3] Chau has compared their relationship to that of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.[1]
In 2012, Chau sued Hong Kong distributor of Beijing-based Caijing under accusations of defamation, with the magazine having made claims of Chau accepting bribes from a mainland government official. Mainland courts ruled in December 2012 that Beijin Caijing Magazine Limited was liable for defamation and ordered the company to publish an apology. Chau's camp has accepted these terms.[11]

Solina Holly Chau Hoi Shuen v SEEC Media Group Ltd (0205)

The judge says: "if anyone from the Defendant would just care to take a casual look at the cover of Issue No. 265, he or she would have noticed the words 'involving the richest man Li Ka Shing'. This should at once ring an alarm bell." So is he saying that distributors are not liable if the libelous material involves less wealthy people?

ITEM 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.  Securities Purchase Agreement 
On April 26, 2017, Pioneer Step Holdings Limited and Champion River Ventures Limited (Champion Rivers, each a
Purchaser and together, the Purchasers) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Issuer (the Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the
Issuer agreed to sell and issue up to $25 million of its Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.60 per share in three tranches of approximately $3.5 million, $16.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The first tranche (the
First Tranche) closed on April 27, 2017, at which closing the Issuer issued 538,462 Shares to Pioneer Step and 807,692 Shares to the other Purchaser. The closing of the second tranche (the Second
Tranche) is expected to occur within 30 days of the closing of the First Tranche, at which closing the Issuer has agreed to issue an aggregate of 6,303,814 Shares to the Purchasers, with the allocation of such Shares to be mutually
agreed upon by the Purchasers at the closing of the Second Tranche. The closing of the Second Tranche is subject only to customary closing conditions and the satisfactory completion of due diligence by the Purchasers. At the closing of the third
tranche (the Third Tranche), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, it is proposed that the Purchasers will acquire, in the aggregate, an additional 1,965,417 Shares. The closing of the
Third Tranche is subject to approval by the Issuers stockholders.  Following the closing of the Second Tranche, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement,
the Issuer shall permit two individuals (collectively, the Observers), with each Purchaser being entitled to nominate one Observer, to attend all meetings of the Issuers Board of Directors (the
Board) in a non-voting capacity, and in connection therewith, the Issuer is required to provide the Observers with certain information that the Issuer provides to the Board. The

observer rights applicable to a particular Purchaser terminate on the date on which such Purchasers director nominee is first actually appointed or elected to the Board. In addition,
subject to certain ownership and other requirements, the Purchase Agreement provides the Purchasers with certain information and access rights relating to the Issuer and its business. 
Subject to completion of the Second Tranche, the Purchase Agreement requires that the Issuers Board increase the number of authorized directors so as to
create two vacant seats on the Board, which vacancies shall be filled on a date following the Issuers 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders by one nominee selected by each of the Purchasers (the Purchaser Designees).
 In addition, from and after the date of the Purchase Agreement, upon prior written request thereof by any Purchaser, the Issuer shall use reasonable
efforts to enter into one or more voting agreements with one or more of the Purchasers and such other substantial holders of Common Stock as reasonably requested by such Purchaser(s) and agreed to by the Issuer in respect of the election of the
Purchaser Designees.  Registration Rights Agreement 
At the closing of the First Tranche and unless otherwise waived by the Purchasers, the Purchase Agreement requires that the Issuer and the Purchasers promptly
enter into a Registration Rights Agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchasers (the Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to the Shares acquired under the Purchase Agreement. The Issuer and
the Purchasers entered into the Registration Rights Agreement on April 29, 2017. The Registration Rights Agreement grants the Purchasers customary shelf and piggyback registration rights. 
The foregoing descriptions of the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to
the full text of the Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, which are incorporated by reference into this Schedule 13D pursuant to Exhibits 99.2 and 99.3 of Item 7 hereof. 
Pioneer Step acquired the Shares as investment in its ordinary course of business. 
In connection with the foregoing, and as may be appropriate from time to time, each of the Reporting Persons may consider the feasibility and advisability of
various alternative courses of action with respect to its investment in the Issuer, including, without limitation: (a) the acquisition or disposition by the Reporting Persons of Shares, including through derivative transactions which may
include security-based swaps and short sales; (b) an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (c) a sale or transfer of a material amount of
assets of the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries; (d) changes in the present board of directors or management of the Issuer; (e) a material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer; (f) other material
changes in the Issuers business or corporate structure; (g) changes in the Issuers articles of incorporation or bylaws or other actions that may impede the acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person; (h) causing any
class of the Issuers securities to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association; (i) causing a class of
equity securities of the Issuer to become eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act; or (j) any action similar to those enumerated above. 
Except as described in Item 6 and this Item 4 and any plans or proposals that may from time to time be discussed or considered by the directors of the Issuer,
including the Purchaser Designees, in their fiduciary capacities as directors of the Issuer, the Reporting Persons do not currently have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the actions specified in clause (a) through
(j) of this paragraph.  The Reporting Persons reserve the right, based on all relevant factors and subject to applicable law or other restrictions, at any
time and from time to time, to acquire additional Shares, dispose of some or all of the Shares, in each case in open market or private transactions, block sales or otherwise, and review or reconsider their position, change their purpose, take other
actions (including actions that could involve one or more of the types of transactions or have one or more of the results described in clauses (a) through (j) of the foregoing paragraph of this Item 4) or formulate and implement plans or
proposals with respect to any of the foregoing. Except as set forth in this Schedule 13D, no contract, arrangement, relationship or understanding (either oral or written) exists among the Reporting Persons as to the acquisition, disposition, voting
or holding of Shares.

The Reporting Persons intend to review their investment in the Issuer from time to time on the basis of
various factors, including the Issuers business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic and industry conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuers stock in particular, as well
as other developments.   


ITEM 5.
INTEREST IN SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.  (a) and (b) As of May 8, 2017, Pioneer Step
beneficially owned and had sole voting and dispositive power with respect to 538,462 Shares, representing approximately 1.4% of the 39,788,205 outstanding Shares as of the date of this Schedule 13D, based on 38,442,051 Shares reported by the Issuer
to be outstanding as of April 24, 2017, in the Issuers Definitive Proxy Statement, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2017, plus 538,462 Shares and 807,692 Shares issued in the First Tranche to Pioneer
Step and Champion River, respectively, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement described in Item 4 of this Schedule 13D.  As of May 8, 2017, Solina Chau,
by virtue of being the sole shareholder of Pioneer Step, may be deemed to beneficially own and have sole voting and dispositive power with respect to the Shares beneficially owned by Pioneer Step. 
By virtue of being a party to the Purchase Agreement, until the closing of the Third Tranche, each of Pioneer Step and Champion River may be deemed to be
members of a group, as defined in Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, at the closing of the Second Tranche Pioneer Step and Champion River have the right to acquire
an additional 6,303,814 Shares, with the allocation of such Shares between Pioneer Step and Champion River to be mutually agreed upon by Pioneer Step and Champion River at the closing of the Second Tranche. As a result, until the closing of the
Second Tranche, each of Pioneer Step and Champion River may be deemed to beneficially own the Shares beneficially owned by each other solely for such purposes. The aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned collectively by Pioneer Step and
Champion River is therefore 7,649,968, which represents approximately 16.6% of the outstanding Shares, based on 38,442,051 Shares reported by the Issuer to be outstanding as of April 24, 2017, in the Issuers Definitive Proxy Statement, as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2017, plus 538,462 Shares and 807,692 Shares issued in the First Tranche to Pioneer Step and Champion River, respectively, plus an aggregate of 6,303,814 Shares that the Purchasers
have the right to acquire from the Issuer in the Second Tranche.  The share ownership reported by Pioneer Step on this Schedule 13D does not include any
Shares owned by Champion River, and each of Pioneer Step and the other Reporting Person on this Schedule 13D disclaims beneficial ownership of any Shares owned by Champion River or any other person. 
(c) Information with respect to all transactions in the Shares beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons that were effected during the past sixty days is
set forth in Item 4 and incorporated herein by reference.  (d) Not applicable. 
(e) Not applicable.   


ITEM 6.
CONTRACTS, ARRANGEMENTS, UNDERSTANDINGS OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES OF THE ISSUER.  The
information set forth in Item 4 hereof is hereby incorporated by reference into this Item 6. Except as referenced above or described in Item 4 hereof, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships among the Reporting Persons
or between such Reporting Persons and any other person with respect to any securities of the Issuer.

REASONS FOR JUDGMENT
____________________________
Chief Justice Ma:
1.  I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Fok PJ.
Mr Justice RibeiroPJ:
2.  I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Fok PJ.



Mr Justice Tang PJ:
3.  I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Fok PJ.
Mr Justice Fok PJ :
4.  This appeal arose out of an action for libel brought against a distributor of a periodical magazine and raised an important questionas to the ambit of the defence of innocent dissemination in the law of defamation.  The appellant sought to rely on that defenceto avoid liability to the respondent but the courts below held that it did not avail the appellant in this case.
5.  After hearing counsel for the appellant,[1] the court dismissed the appeal with costs and indicated that it would hand down its reasons for doing so in due course.
A. The facts
6.  The action, being for libel, concerned words printed in a fortnightly magazine known as “Caijing” (“the Magazine”).  TheMagazine was founded in 1998 and originally published in Beijing by an entity established by a Mr Wang Boming known as the “StockExchange Executive Council” (“SEEC”).  By the time of the publication giving rise to the action, the Magazine was publishedin Beijing by a company known as “Beijing Caijing Magazine Limited” (“the Publisher”) and SEEC continued to have a role inrelation to the governing and management of the Magazine.



7.  The respondent is a prominent businesswoman and well-known philanthropist in Hong Kong and the Mainland.  She participates in charitableactivities organised by the Li Ka Shing Foundation and also by a foundation bearing her own name.
8.  The words giving rise to the respondent’s action for libel appeared in two articles contained in Issue No.265 of the Magazinedated 7 June 2010.  The articles were respectively entitled (in translation) “Alliance of the newly appointed officials (or VIP)”and “Middle Chapter: Two-way Tollbooth” and the issue in question carried a cover which bears a banner title reading (in translation):“Alliance of the newly appointed officials (or VIP).  How did a group of young technocrats who stretched across business, commercial-industrialand forex sectors set up the two-way tollbooth on foreign investment approval, involving the richest Chinese man Li Ka Shing, therichest man in China Huang Guang Yu and also famous enterprises such as Siemens, Philips and Capital Group.”  The second articlereferred to the respondent by name and alleged that she had engaged in corruption by paying US$500,000 by way of a “consultancyfee”, part of which was intended by her to be distributed to a senior government official in Mainland China for assisting in theapproval of projects related to Cheung Kong (Holdings) Limited by the Mainland authorities.  That article also alleged that the respondenthad admitted to the police that she had paid the US$500,000 “consultancy fee”.
9.  The appellant is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands whose shares are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  It is aholding company of a group of subsidiaries, including the company having the exclusive advertising rights for the Magazine.  Thereis a close connection between the appellant and the Publisher.  Its four directors, who include Mr Wang, are also directors of thePublisher.  Mr Wang is the chairman and chief executive officer of the appellant, the chairman and legal representative of the Publisherand the editor-in-charge of the Magazine and chief executive officer of SEEC.  The offices used by the appellant, the Publisher andSEEC in Beijing are all located on different floors of the same building.
10.  In Hong Kong, the appellant handled the subscriptions of the Magazine here and overseas (excluding China) and its distribution tosuch subscribers, of which there were about 180.  Distribution of the Magazine by the appellant occurred in the following manner:

(1) At the material time, the appellant had a small office in Hong Kong with two employees.  For each issue of the Magazine, one ofthe appellant’s employees, a Ms Chan, would prepare envelopes with address labels and postage for subscribers overseas and forthose in non-commercial areas of Hong Kong.  For the local subscribers in commercial areas, Ms Chan prepared address labels.
(2) Ms Chan would then give all the envelopes and labels to a courier company, EDS Express Co., who in turn would collect a numberof copies of the Magazine from a newspaper distributor, Chan Sun Kee Books And Newspaper Ltd. (“Chan Sun Kee”), to whom copieswere delivered directly from the printer in Shenzhen.  The courier company would then put the subscribers’ copies of the Magazineinto the envelopes prepared by Ms Chan or stick the address labels she had prepared onto the plastic wrapping of the Magazine.  Thecourier company would then deliver or post the subscribers’ copies of the Magazine.
(3) The appellant’s two employees in Hong Kong would only receive copies of each issue of the Magazine after they had been distributedby the courier when Chan Sun Kee would return the left-over copies about two or three days after the bulk of the copies of the Magazinehad been dispatched to newsagents for sale, or delivered or posted to subscribers by the courier.

B. The proceedings below
11.  At trial in the Court of  First Instance,[2] the appellant did not contest the defamatory nature of the words complained of and the Recorder found that those words were defamatoryof the respondent “in a serious way” in that they suggested that she was involved in paying bribes to corrupt officials on theMainland in her capacity both as a good friend of Mr Li Ka Shing and as a director of the Li Ka Shing Foundation in return for favoursshown or facilities granted to Mr Li’s companies.[3]



12.  Instead, the main issue at trial was whether the appellant, as a distributor of the Magazine, was liable to the respondent for thelibel or whether it could avail itself of the defence of innocent dissemination.  The Recorder rejected the appellant’s argumentthat the defence was only defeated where a subordinate publisher distributed with knowledge that the material contained an actionablelibel on the plaintiff to which there was no defence.[4] He held that the appellant was not entitled to rely on the defence of innocent dissemination because he found that its ignoranceof the “libellous material” was due to its negligence in adopting a system whereby it did not vet the issues of the Magazinedistributed by it in any manner.[5]  He also held that the appellant failed to prove that it did not in fact know the relevant issue of the Magazine “contained thelibel complained of” before it caused copies to be distributed to the subscribers in Hong Kong and overseas, so that the defenceof innocent dissemination failed regardless of any negligence.[6]
13.  The Recorder gave judgment for the respondent and awarded damages in her favour in the sum of HK$650,000.
14.  On appeal to the Court of Appeal,[7] the only issue was whether the defence of innocent dissemination relieved the appellant of liability for the libel.  The appellantcontended, as it had at trial, that a subordinate distributor should not be held liable for a libel unless he knew or ought to haveknown that the material distributed contained an actionable libel on the plaintiff to which there was no defence.



15.  Cheung JA, delivering the only reasoned judgment (with which Yeung VP and Chu JA agreed), rejected the appellant’s contentionas to the ambit of the defence of innocent dissemination and concluded that the defence was not available because, upholding theRecorder, he held that the appellant’s lack of knowledge “of the defamatory content” was due to its negligence.[8] Having held the appellant to have been negligent, Cheung JA dismissed the appeal and declined to address the issue of whether theappellant had actual knowledge of the defamatory matter through attribution of Mr Wang’s knowledge of the libel.[9]
C. The question of law for which leave to appeal was granted
16.  The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s application for leave to appeal to this Court[10] and the appellant renewed its application to the Appeal Committee which granted leave to the appellant to appeal to this Court onthe following question of law of great general or public importance, namely:

“What is the nature of the knowledge possessed by a secondary publisher or which, taking reasonable care, a secondary publisherwould have acquired, which suffices to exclude such secondary publisher from relying on the defence of innocent dissemination? Inparticular, must it be knowledge simply that the publication contains a statement which carries a defamatory meaning; or must itbe knowledge that the publication contains an actionable libel subject to no valid defences?”[11]

17.  As can be seen, the question posits two alternative states of knowledge for the defence of innocent dissemination, namely: (i) knowledgethat the publication contains a statement carrying a defamatory meaning; and (ii) knowledge that the publication contains an actionablelibel subject to no valid defences.  It was the appellant’s case that the correct answer to the question is (ii) and that, sincethe courts below did not exclude reliance on the defence on the basis of such knowledge, the judgments below must be set aside anda re-trial ordered. Alternatively, the appellant invited us to go further and hold that, on any view of the evidence, it could notbe said that the appellant was negligent in not knowing that the Magazine contained an actionable libel to which there was no defenceand that, whatever Mr Wang’s state of knowledge, this could not be attributed to the appellant.  On that basis, the appellant invitedus to set aside the judgments below and dismiss the action altogether.
18.  To put the question into its proper context, it is useful to review some of the general principles applying to the law of defamationrelating to libel and publication and the defence of innocent dissemination.



D. Libel and publication



19.  Subject to the balance that needs to be struck to protect freedom of expression, the law of defamation seeks to protect a person’sreputation, it being recognised that it is necessary to afford such protection against untrue statements which lower that personin the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally.[12] In Hong Kong, the law of defamation is governed by the common law as modified by the provisions of the Defamation Ordinance.[13]  A defamatory statement may be made orally, in which case it constitutes the tort of slander, or in writing, in which case it constitutesthe tort of libel.  One of the necessary elements of either tort is publication of the defamatory matter complained of.
20.  In Oriental Press Group Ltd v Fevaworks Solutions Ltd,[14] Ribeiro PJ (with whom the other members of the court agreed) comprehensively reviewed the law relating to what constitutes publicationof a libel.[15]  As there pointed out (at [19]), until mitigated by the common law defence of innocent dissemination, liability for publishing alibel was strict:

“A person was held liable for publishing a libel if by an act of any description, he could be said to have intentionally assistedin the process of conveying the words bearing the defamatory meaning to a third party, regardless of whether he knew that the article in question contained those words.” (Emphasis added)

21.  At common law, as a matter of general principle, the person who first spoke or composed the defamatory matter, who may be calledthe originator, is liable provided he intended to publish it or failed to take reasonable care to prevent publication.  Liabilityextends to any person who participated in, secured (e.g. by encouraging or procuring) or authorised the publication, including theprinter of a defamatory work.[16] These persons may all be referred to as the first or main publishers (to distinguish them from subordinate publishers, which areaddressed below) and, in a newspaper or magazine setting, the journalist, editor, printers and (vicariously) the newspaper proprietorare all treated as the first or main publishers.[17]
22.  Liability for the publication of defamatory material at common law is strict and so a first or main publisher is liable for thetort of libel unless, broadly, he establishes a defence such as justification or honest comment or demonstrates that the publicationwas on an occasion of privilege or establishes one of the specific defences available under the Defamation Ordinance.
23.  It was in order to mitigate against the harshness of the publication rule as it applies to first or main publishers that the commonlaw developed the defence of innocent dissemination.[18] This defence is available to a person who is not the author, printer or first or main publisher of a work which contains a libelbut who only takes a subordinate part in disseminating it, for example by selling, distributing or handing to another a copy of thenewspaper or book containing it.[19]  Such distributors, or subordinate publishers, can avoid liability for the publication if they establish the elements of the defence(addressed below).
24.  Apart from the first or main publishers and subsidiary publishers, the common law also recognises that persons may be involved asintermediaries in the publication of defamatory matter but simply as mere conduits that do no more than fulfil the role of a passivemedium for communication.  A telephone carrier is an example of this type of intermediary, which may be referred to as a mere facilitator.[20] Such an intermediary does not publish at all and therefore has no need for the mitigating defence of innocent dissemination.
25.  In the present case, it was accepted by the appellant that it was a subordinate publisher of the Magazine and it was not contended(by the respondent) that the appellant was either a first or main publisher, who would be strictly liable for publishing the defamatorystatements complained of, or (by the appellant) that it was a mere facilitator, who would not have published them at all.
E. The defence of innocent dissemination
E.1 The elements of the defence as identified in Fevaworks
26.  As a subordinate publisher, the appellant could avoid liability if it were able to establish the elements of the defence of innocentdissemination. In Fevaworks, Ribeiro PJ identified those elements by reference to the judgment of Romer LJ in Vizetelly v Mudie’s Select Library Ltd,[21] namely the subordinate publisher must show:

(1) that he was innocent of any knowledge of the libel contained in the work disseminated by him;
(2) that there was nothing in the work or the circumstances under which it came to him or was disseminated by him which ought to haveled him to suppose that it contained a libel; and
(3) that, when the work was disseminated by him, it was not by any negligence on his part that he did not know that it contained thelibel.

The onus lies on the subordinate publisher to prove the elements of the defence.  Where he does so, Ribeiro PJ held that, althoughhe will have published the libel, he will not be responsible for it.[22]
27.  Ribeiro PJ drew attention to two important features of the defence: first, that it is not available to the first or main publisherbut only to persons who, in the ordinary course of business, play a subordinate part in disseminating it; and secondly, that, forthis class of persons, it replaces the strict liability rule with one which imposes liability on the basis that the person playingthe subordinate role knew or ought by the exercise of reasonable care, in the circumstances in which the work came to him or wasdisseminated, to have known that the article disseminated contained defamatory material.[23]
28.  In this appeal, it was accepted by both parties that the defence of innocent dissemination is correctly stated in Fevaworks and it was not suggested that the Court should depart in any way from its decision in that case as to the nature and elements ofthe defence.  Instead, the question of law which is raised by the appellant’s case in this appeal relates to an aspect of the defencenot directly addressed in Fevaworks.
E.2 The question of law posed and the parties’ respective positions
29.  The question of law for which leave to appeal was granted is set out at paragraph 16 above and, as noted in paragraph 17 above,the appellant’s case in answer to the question posed is that the state of knowledge required to exclude the defence of innocentdissemination is knowledge that the publication contains an actionable libel subject to no valid defences.
30.  The appellant’s case, as further clarified by Mr Shieh in his oral submissions, was that the true rule is that the subordinatepublisher is only excluded from the defence of innocent dissemination if it knew or ought reasonably to have known:

(a) that the material distributed contained the statement complained of;
(b) that such statement bore a defamatory meaning; and
(c) that there was no defence against an action for defamation.

Reformulated to reflect the appellant’s acceptance that it bears the burden of proof, it was the appellant’s case that it is onlyexcluded from the defence if it is unable to show on a balance of probabilities that it did not know, and could not reasonably havebeen expected to have known the matters in (a), (b) and (c).  In the course of argument, knowledge extending to all three of thesematters was referred to as “Type C knowledge” and I shall adopt that description in this judgment.
31.  For the respondent, Mr Johnny Mok SC[24] invited us to reject the appellant’s contention as to the requisite state of knowledge.  However, he rightly pointed out that thefirst alternative posed in the certified question, namely knowledge that the publication contains a statement carrying a defamatorymeaning, itself posited two alternatives:

(1) The respondent’s first alternative was that the defence is excluded unless the subordinate publisher can show that it did notknow of and could not reasonably have discovered the existence and gist of the content complained of in the article distributed,it being irrelevant whether the defendant knew that such content had a defamatory meaning.  It will be seen that this is the sameas knowledge limited to (a) in the appellant’s formulation above and, for convenience, it was referred to as “Type A knowledge”.
(2) The respondent’s second alternative was that the defence is excluded unless the subordinate publisher can show that it did notknow of and could not reasonably have discovered the existence and gist of the content complained of in the article distributed,or that it knew of such content but did not know of and could not reasonably have discovered that such content had a defamatory meaning. This is the same as knowledge that extends to (b) in the appellant’s formulation above and was referred to as “Type B knowledge”.

32.  Strictly, the question of whether the requisite knowledge to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination is Type C knowledge mightbe said not to arise on the facts of the case.  It was not suggested in the appellant’s evidence at trial that, prior to publishingthe words complained of, it had considered them but had formed a reasonable belief that an action for libel could be successfullydefended.  However, the courts below fully considered and rejected the appellant’s contention that, as a matter of law, proof ofType C knowledge was required to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination.  Moreover, in deciding the case, the courts belowclearly did not apply that test of knowledge to the facts in arriving at their conclusion that the appellant had not establishedthe defence.  It is therefore appropriate for this Court to resolve the question of whether the appellant’s contention that proofof Type C knowledge is required is correct.
E.3 Lord Denning’s judgment in Goldsmith v Sperrings
33.  The appellant’s assertion of the need for proof of Type C knowledge to defeat the defence is solely based, as Mr Shieh candidlyaccepted, on a view expressed by Lord Denning in his judgment in Goldsmith v Sperrings.[25] That case involved multiple actions against the publishers of the satirical magazine “Private Eye” which led to an applicationby a group of retail distributors of the magazine for an order that the actions against them should be stayed or struck out as anabuse since they were being pursued not to protect the plaintiff’s reputation but, instead, for the collateral purpose of destroyingthe magazine by cutting off its retail outlets.  The parties had argued the appeal on the assumption that the distributors were prima facie liable and the majority of the Court of Appeal (Scarman and Bridge LJJ) dismissed the distributors’ appeal on the basis that, atan interlocutory stage, there was no sufficiently clear evidence to establish that the action was being pursued for an illegitimatecollateral purpose.
34.  The third member of the court, Lord Denning MR, took a very different view.  He disagreed with his brethren on the issue of abusebut, additionally, he held, in effect, that the action did not disclose a reasonable cause of action because there was no liabilityon the part of the distributors.  This was based on his view of the law that:

“Common sense and fairness require that no subordinate distributor – from top to bottom – should be held liable for a libelcontained in it unless he knew or ought to have known that the newspaper or periodical contained a libel on the plaintiff himself;that is to say, that it contained a libel on the plaintiff which could not be justified or excused: and I should have thought thatit was for the plaintiff to prove this.”[26]

35.  It will be seen that this dictum of Lord Denning, which was clearly obiter, posits proof of an absence of Type C knowledge for the defence of innocent dissemination; hence, the appellant’s reliance on hisjudgment.  As already noted, however, the appellant did not go so far as to adopt Lord Denning’s suggestion that the burden shouldbe on the plaintiff to prove that knowledge on the part of the distributor.
36.  Lord Denning’s view of the law on this point does not appear to have been embraced by any other common law court.  It was consideredat first instance by Eady J in Metropolitan International Schools Ltd (trading as Skillstrain and/or Train2Game) v Designtechnica Corpn (trading as Digital Trends)and others[27] in the context of an action against an internet search engine (Google) in respect of allegedly defamatory comments appearing in a“snippet” of information generated on a search.  He held that Google had no responsibility for the publication and set asidethe grant of leave to serve the writ on it out of the jurisdiction.  Of relevance to this appeal is that he rejected Lord Denning’sview on the ambit of the defence of innocent dissemination (for the reasons addressed below).[28]
37.  Academic commentators have taken mixed positions on this issue.  The editors of Gatley set out the elements of the defence at [6.30] where they adopt the formulation that the defendant must show[29] “that he did not know that the book or paper contained the libel complained of”.  In footnote 254, reference is made to BridgeLJ’s judgment in Goldsmith v Sperrings at p.505 where he refers to knowledge that the publication contained “defamatory matter” (suggesting Type A or Type B knowledgebut not Type C) and then contrasts Lord Denning’s dissenting judgment quoting the passage cited above.  The editors of Duncan and Neill on Defamation (4th Ed.) also note the difference of opinion between Lord Denning and Bridge LJ[30] but do not offer a view as to which is correct.  Support for Lord Denning’s view is, however, forthcoming in Carter-Ruck on Libel and Privacy where it is suggested his is the “better view” although it is noted that the position is “not without doubt”[31] and in Collins on Defamation, which appears to favour Lord Denning’s view and criticises Eady J’s rejection of it in Metropolitan International Schools.[32]
E.4 Is Type C knowledge required?
38.  This is the critical question on which the appeal turns and, for the reasons which follow, the appellant’s contention that proofof Type C knowledge is required in order to defeat the defence must be rejected.
39.  First, as a matter of principle, the rationale of the defence of innocent dissemination is to mitigate against the harshness ofthe strict publication rule, which does not require the first or main publisher to be aware of the defamatory nature of the materialhe is publishing.[33] Instead, the criteria which affix him with liability as the first or main publisher are knowledge and control.[34]  As to the nature of the knowledge required, Ribeiro PJ’s judgment in Fevaworks demonstrates clearly that it is knowledge of the contents of the publication.[35]  Whilst this analysis is material to the antecedent, and different, question of whether someone is a first or main publisher, andas such subject to the strict publication rule, there is no logical basis for importing a different test of knowledge for the subsequentquestion of whether a person who is not a first or main publisher, because he does not exercise any control over the content published,[36] can bring himself within the requirements of the defence of innocent dissemination.
40.  In this context, it is highly material that Ribeiro PJ equated the knowledge criterion that identifies a distinguishing characteristicof a first or main publisher with the first requirement of the defence of innocent dissemination.[37] It is also noteworthy that Ribeiro PJ considered that the same standard of reasonableness should apply to the situation of acquiredknowledge.  Where a subordinate publisher had unwittingly published defamatory matter, he would be protected by the defence of innocentdissemination.  Ribeiro PJ held that he should be afforded the continued protection of the defence, “if he proves that upon becomingaware of such content, he promptly took all reasonable steps to remove the offending content from circulation as soon as reasonablypracticable”.[38]
41.  To make the defence dependent on proof of an absence of Type C knowledge would therefore be to put the defence on a very differentfooting to its underlying rationale of mitigating the harshness of the strict publication rule.
42.  Secondly, in his judgment in Goldsmith v Sperrings, Lord Denning does not cite any authority for his formulation of the knowledge element of the defence.  To the contrary, none ofthe leading cases in which the defence was developed support the requirement of proof of Type C knowledge to defeat the defence.

(1) In Emmens v Pottle,[39] Lord Esher MR held that the defendant vendor of a newspaper was “primâ facie liable” for having sold a newspaper containing“a libel on the plaintiff” and therefore required to demonstrate facts which showed they did not publish the libel.[40]  Similarly, in Vizetelly v Mudie’s Select Library Ltd (supra), Romer LJ referred to dissemination of the defamatory material as resulting in “primâ facie publication of it” and hence liabilityunless the elements of the defence of innocent dissemination were established.[41] Prima facie liability in defamation is necessarily subject to positive defences such as justification, honest comment or privilege.  There isno reason to suppose that Lord Esher or Romer LJ were contemplating Type C knowledge for the defence of innocent dissemination sinceprima facie liability necessarily suggests a liability which stands until defeated by some positive defence and in neither case did they suggestthat the respective defendants would have avoided liability if they merely proved they believed such a defence existed.
(2) Nor is Type C knowledge suggested as relevant to the defence of innocent dissemination in Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada v W.H. Smith & Son Ltd.[42] In that case, the defendant newspaper vendors were held to have been negligent in failing properly to supervise the display of postersat their bookstalls.  In Scrutton LJ’s formulation of the elements of the defence of innocent dissemination, he referred to negligencein respect of the “publication of the libel” and, when referring to the finding of the jury, his Lordship appears to have referredto this as meaning that the statement was found to bear “a libellous meaning”.[43]  Greer LJ found liability established on the basis of the jury’s finding that the relevant poster “contained statements whichwere defamatory of the plaintiffs” since the stall manager “must have known its contents”.[44]  Neither Scrutton LJ nor Greer LJ’s judgments lend any support for the need to establish Type C knowledge to defeat the defenceof innocent dissemination.

43.  Thirdly, there are significant practical difficulties in determining how the defence will operate.  These were identified by EadyJ in the following terms:

“… it seems to me that the defence of innocent dissemination as interpreted by Lord Denning MR throws up more problems than itis likely to solve. How could someone hoping to avail himself of the defence know that a defence of justification was bound to fail, save in the simplest of cases? How is he/she to approach the (often controversialand uncertain) question of meaning? How much legal knowledge is to be attributed to him/her in arriving at these conclusions? Whatof a possible Reynolds defence?”[45] (Emphasis in original)

Notwithstanding the criticism to which this passage is subjected in Collins on Defamation (supra), these practical difficulties are very real and call into question the soundness of the appellant’s contention that proof of TypeC knowledge is required to defeat the defence.  It is true, as the appellant submits, that the question of meaning applies whetherproof of Type B or Type C knowledge is required but, if so, that may simply be a reason for preferring to regard proof of Type Aknowledge (where meaning does not arise) as the requisite mental state for the defence.
44.  In this context, the appellant’s reliance on Regulation 19 of the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002 in the UnitedKingdom[46] is overstated.  The appellants seek to rely on that Regulation by way of example of another context in which a defence depends ona party assessing the strength or weakness of potential defences.  However, such an assessment is in respect of various forms ofunlawfulness including crimes such as hate speech or incitement to violence where the unlawfulness may be self-evident.  In the contextof defamation, the imposition of such an assessment may be problematic or unworkable.[47]  Moreover, the specific and limited context of that Regulation is the protection of Internet service providers from liability forstorage of information on their servers and there is no reason to conclude that the policy decision underlying the Regulation reflectsthe common law defence of innocent dissemination.
45.  Fourthly, contrary to the appellant’s submission that imposing a requirement of proof of Type C knowledge to defeat the defencestrikes a proper balance between freedom of expression on the one hand and reputational protection on the other, an acceptance ofthe appellant’s case would skew that balance very heavily in favour of a subordinate publisher.  Given the practical difficultiesidentified above, requiring proof of Type C knowledge to defeat the defence will make it virtually impossible successfully to suea subordinate publisher.  Such publishers will in practice have near immunity against suit for passing on defamatory statements and,unlike first or main publishers who are subject to the strict publication rule, will be relieved of the need to establish one ofthe traditional defences such as justification or privilege in order to avoid liability.  Whilst it may be desirable to protect smallnewsvendors and distributors against litigation for material originated by others, it must not be forgotten that it is through theacts of these newsvendors and distributors that a plaintiff’s reputation will in fact be harmed and there is no assurance thatan action against the first or main publisher will be possible or effective.  If such protection is required, this would seem tobe more appropriately achieved by means of legislation, rather than the adoption of an unprincipled or problematic test as part ofthe common law defence.
46.  Fifthly, in none of the following common law jurisdictions in which the defence of innocent dissemination has been put on a statutorybasis is it required to prove an absence of Type C knowledge.  Instead:




(1) In the UK, s.1(1) of the Defamation Act 1996 provides that it is a defence for a defendant to show, among other things, that:“(c)  he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that what he did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatorystatement”;
(2) The legislation in Australia[48] consistently provides that the defence is available where a defendant shows, among other things, that “(b) the defendant neitherknew, nor ought reasonably to have known, that the matter was defamatory”;
(3) In New Zealand, s.21 of the Defamation Act 1992 provides that the defence is available where a person shows, among other things,“(a) That that person did not know that the matter contained the material that is alleged to be defamatory”; and
(4) In Ireland, s.27(1) of the Defamation Act 2009 (which expressly replaces the common law defence[49]) provides that the defence is available where the defendant proves, among other things, that “(c) he or she did not know, and hadno reason to believe, that what he or she did caused or contributed to the publication of a statement that would give rise to a causeof action in defamation.”

47.  Although the absence of any statutory support for Type C knowledge as an element of the defence of innocent dissemination is notconclusive, it lends some support to the view that its adoption was seen in those jurisdictions as problematic and not striking theright balance between free speech and the right to protection of reputation.  It also lends support to the view that, in those jurisdictions,insofar as the statutory provision was to codify the common law defence, it was not thought that the common law defence requiredproof of an absence of Type C knowledge.
48.  In this context, in respect of the UK Defamation Act 1996, submissions were made to us (as they had been to the Court of Appeal[50]) by reference to the Parliamentary debate concerning what became s.1 of that Act.  It is unnecessary to explore that debate or toconsider those submissions at length.  The statutory defence in s.1 of the 1996 Act was clearly intended to afford protection tothose subordinate publishers (at least[51]) to whom the common law defence of innocent dissemination would be available. Although the 1996 Act did not expressly abolish thecommon law defence, it has been held to have effectively superseded it.[52] But since it cannot be demonstrated conclusively whether the s.1 defence codified the common law or provided for a narrower defence(as some academic commentators suggest[53]), a consideration of the Parliamentary debate does not assist in answering the question posed in this appeal.
49.  Similarly, comments made in the context of the consideration of the bill that became the UK Defamation Act 2013 do not assist. Mr Shieh referred us, for example, to the views of the Joint Committee on the Draft Defamation Bill and of the Booksellers Associationon their understanding of the ambit of the common law defence, suggesting that proof of Type C knowledge was required to excludethe defence.[54] These comments are not authoritative and it remains for the court to determine the true ambit of the common law defence as a matterof principle.
50.  S.10(1) of the UK 2013 Act[55] affords greater protection than the common law for subordinate publishers in that such a publisher cannot be sued unless it is notreasonably practicable to sue the author, editor or publisher, i.e. the first or main publisher.  In the same way, as noted above,s.1 of the 1996 Act had extended the statutory defence to printers and live broadcasters, to whom the common law defence might notapply. These are examples of legislation seeking to strike a particular balance between free speech and the right to protection ofreputation and there may be strong arguments for adopting such a balance in this jurisdiction.  But if so, that is a balance thatmust be struck by the Legislature since it is different to the balance struck by the operation of the common law defence of innocentdissemination.
E.5 The consequence of rejecting Type C knowledge
51.  Mr Shieh accepted that, if the Court rejected his submission that proof of Type C knowledge was required to defeat the defence ofinnocent dissemination, it would follow that the appeal must be dismissed.  As demonstrated in Section F below, on the Recorder’sfinding of negligence, upheld by the Court of Appeal, the appellant could not bring itself within the defence of innocent disseminationand thereby avoid liability to the respondent for the defamatory statements contained in the Magazine.
E.6 Is it necessary to resolve whether the defence is excluded by Type A knowledge or by Type B knowledge?
52.  Mr Mok confirmed, in answer to an inquiry from the bench, that it did not matter to the respondent’s case in this appeal whetherit was proof of Type A knowledge that was required in order to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination or proof of Type B knowledge. This must be correct.  As shown in Section F below, the courts below held that the appellant’s negligence consisted in not inspectingthe Magazine at all.  They held that, had the appellant done so, it would have discovered the libellous material about the plaintiff. This must at least equate to an absence of proof of Type B knowledge and so whether the true basis of the defence is an absenceof proof of Type A knowledge as opposed to Type B knowledge is immaterial to the outcome of this case.
53.  Whether the correct mental state for the defence is absence of proof of Type A knowledge or Type B knowledge is not an easy question. It involves the difficult balance between freedom of speech and the right to protection of reputation.  As such, it may engage adebate about the constitutionality of the defence of innocent dissemination, an issue which has not been raised in this appeal butwhich could be raised in a case where the distinction between Type A and Type B knowledge were material to the outcome of the case. In the circumstances, it is preferable not to answer that question in the context of this appeal but instead to leave the issueopen to await determination in a suitable case.
F. Applying the law to the facts
54.  In view of Mr Shieh’s correct acceptance that the appeal must be dismissed if he lost on the point of law raised in the appeal,it is not strictly necessary to analyse the facts of the case and to apply the law to those facts.  However, there is some valuein doing so in order to demonstrate how the defence of innocent dissemination works.
55.  Here, it will be recalled, in seeking to bring itself within the defence, the appellant accepted that it bore the burden of showingthat there was no negligence on its part in not knowing that the relevant issue of the Magazine contained statements defamatory ofthe respondent.  As shown in Section A above, in particular in paragraph 10, the appellant’s employees in Hong Kong did not actuallysee the Magazine until after it was distributed by them via Chan Sun Kee and the courier and there was no evidence of any employeeof the appellant elsewhere having seen it.  It may be thought that a denial of the defence of innocent dissemination in these circumstancesis harsh. However, for the reasons given by the Recorder, and developed by the Court of Appeal, the banner heading on the cover ofthe relevant issue of the Magazine was clearly such as to put any reader of it on notice to the possibility that the related articlesin the Magazine might contain defamatory statements.  In these circumstances, even a cursory inspection of the issue in questionwould have put the appellant distributor on notice of the possibility or likelihood that the Magazine about to be disseminated containeddefamatory material.  The Respondent and Court of Appeal were entitled to find that to adopt a system which eliminated even a cursoryinspection was negligent.  That finding of negligence is not challenged by the appellant, quite realistically, since it is a concurrentfinding by the courts below.
56.  On the basis of that finding, the common law defence of innocent dissemination is not available to the appellant, since it cannotshow that its lack of knowledge of the defamatory statements in the Magazine was not due to its negligence.  Accordingly, no otherdefence being asserted, it is liable to the respondent for damages for the tort of libel.
57.  That is not to say, however, that an omission to look at a publication before distribution in every case will be sufficient to establishthe necessary degree of negligence to defeat the defence of innocent dissemination.  This is a question that is fact and contextsensitive and will depend on all the circumstances of the particular publication.  What will be negligent in the case of a distributorof a print publication with features putting any reader on alert as to the possible defamatory content, will not necessarily be negligentin the very different context of an Internet web host which receives many thousands of posts from different sources to a web forum. As Ribeiro PJ pointed out in Fevaworks, there is a qualitative difference between the “one-to-many” publications of the more traditional print and broadcast publicationsand the “many-to-many” communications that are involved in Internet publications[56] and what is needed to satisfy the standard of reasonable care will vary according to the circumstances.[57]  In the latter context, there are strong reasons of principle and policy to set the relevant negligence standard at a level thatonly exposes the distributor to liability when there has been a failure to respond appropriately after defamatory material is drawnto its attention.[58]  Whether that also applies to a distributor of a newspaper or magazine will depend on the facts of the given case.  The present appealis not such a case.



G. Conclusion
58.  For these reasons, I would dismiss this appeal with costs.
Lord Collins of Mapesbury NPJ:
59.  I agree with the judgment of Mr Justice Fok PJ.

EXPLANATORY STATEMENT. 
This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D (Amendment No. 1) relates to shares of Common Stock of the
Issuer and is being filed on behalf of the Reporting Persons. This Amendment No. 1 amends and supplements the Schedule 13D previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 8, 2017 (the Initial Schedule
13D, together with this Amendment No. 1, the Schedule 13D). This Amendment No. 1 is being amended to reflect certain changes to the aggregate amount of shares beneficially owned by the Reporting
Persons.   


ITEM 4.
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION.  Securities Purchase Agreement 
On April 26, 2017, Pioneer Step Holdings Limited and Champion River Ventures Limited (Champion River, each a
Purchaser and together, the Purchasers) entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Issuer (the Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the
Issuer agreed to sell and issue up to $25 million of its Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.60 per share in three tranches of approximately $3.5 million, $16.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The first tranche (the
First Tranche) closed on April 27, 2017, at which closing the Issuer issued 538,462 Shares to Pioneer Step and 807,692 Shares to the other Purchaser. Pursuant to the First Amendment to Securities Purchase Agreement,
dated May 24, 2017 (the First Amendment), the second tranche (the Second Tranche) closed on May 24, 2017, at which closing the Issuer issued 2,521,526 Shares to Pioneer Step and 3,782,288
Shares to the other Purchaser. At the closing of the third tranche (the Third Tranche), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, it is proposed that the Purchasers will acquire, in the
aggregate, an additional 1,965,417 Shares. The closing of the Third Tranche is subject to approval by the Issuers stockholders.  Following the
closing of the Second Tranche, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer shall permit two individuals (collectively, the Observers), with each Purchaser being entitled to nominate one Observer, to attend all meetings
of the Issuers Board of Directors (the Board) in a non-voting capacity, and in connection therewith, the Issuer is required to provide the Observers with certain information
that the Issuer provides to the Board. The observer rights applicable to a particular Purchaser terminate on the date on which such Purchasers director nominee is first actually appointed or elected to the Board. In addition, subject to
certain ownership and other requirements, the Purchase Agreement provides the Purchasers with certain information and access rights relating to the Issuer and its business. 
As a result of the completion of the Second Tranche, the Purchase Agreement requires that the Issuers Board increase the number of authorized directors

This is a Chinese name; the family name is Chau (周).
Solina Chau Hoi Shuen (周凱旋) (born c. 1961) is a businesswoman in Hong Kong, a business partner in the Cheung Kong Group, and director of the Li Ka Shing Foundation. She is also a major stockholder in Tom.com, a publication and advertising company in the People's Republic of China.[1]

Early Life & Education[edit]
Chau was born in 1961 as the daughter of a Hong Kong small time businessman. She attended the prestigious Diocesan Girls' School in Hong Kong, where was elected junior house captain. She sat the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination in 1978 and graduated in 1979. Upon her graduation, she went on to continue her education in Sydney, Australia at the University of New South Wales.[2][3]
Career[edit]
After living in Australia, Chau lived and worked in London during the 1980s for a short period of time. During the late 1980s, she befriended Debbie Chang, would eventually become one of her longest running business partners.
Chau's first notable achievement within Hong Kong business circles was winning a project to build the Oriental Square in downtown Beijing in 1993. This project, and many others during her early career were accomplished in involvement with former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, Debbie Chang's cousin. Chau also met Li Ka-shing around this time, and the two would later become known for their close companionship and various business partnerships.
In 1999, with Li's help, Chau set up Tom, a Chinese language media comopany, as a Cayman Island registered limited company as a minority (40%) partner together with Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings in a series of transactions which netted her an estimated USD 11 million in cash even before the company began to trade.[4] When Tom was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chau's investment in Tom grew to UCS$1.63 billion, making her the then second-richest woman in Hong Kong.[3]
In 2002, Chau invested RMB ￥ 1 million into an interactive voice-recognition service provider, Beijing Leitingwuji Network Technology Company Limited (北京雷霆无极网络科技有限公司).[5] In September 2003, before the company was even profitable, she sold it to TOM Group for the sum of USD132 million. Its subsidiary TOM Online was then separately listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early 2004.[4] Chau remained a 9.998% shareholder in Tom Online until 12 March 2007, when Tom Group announced an offer for the outstanding shares in Tom Online, to take the company private. Chau also has a 24% stake in TOM Group prior to the announcement.[6]
In 2002, Chau cofounded Horizons Ventures with Debbie Chang, who is the only person named as a director. Li Ka-shing only became an investor in the firm two years after its founding, but his backing as the richest man in Asia has helped the firm stand out above the crowd.[7] Under Chau, Horizons Ventures has invested over US$470 million in more than 80 tech companies, in search of "disruptive" tech entrepreneurs.[8] Its primary investments have been in the United States and Israel, with at least 28 investments in each country respectively since 2006.
Chau has personally stated that her business interests center around nurturing Western companies, viewing them as more innovative. Chau has been noted to invest in companies very quickly, sometimes within 24 hours of startup owners, or immediately after a short coffee meeting. Chau typically brings investments ranging anywhere from $1 million to $20 million to the table. Horizons was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2006. With her direction, the Li Ka-shing foundation has also invested in tech giants such as Facebook, Slack, and Spotify.[7]
She was named one of Forbes Asia's 50 Women in the Mix in 2013.[9] As of 2014, she is listed as the 81nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[10]
Personal life[edit]
Chau is well known for her decades long friendship with Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, who she met through a mutual friend in the 1990s. Li is 33 years her senior and is Chau's closest confidante, and the pair have backed and advised each other through many of their projects. Chau has been seen kneeling down in public to tie Li's shoelaces and holding his umbrella in the rain.[3] Chau has compared their relationship to that of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.[1]
In 2012, Chau sued Hong Kong distributor of Beijing-based Caijing under accusations of defamation, with the magazine having made claims of Chau accepting bribes from a mainland government official. Mainland courts ruled in December 2012 that Beijin Caijing Magazine Limited was liable for defamation and ordered the company to publish an apology. Chau's camp has accepted these terms.[11]

Early Life & Education[edit]
Chau was born in 1961 as the daughter of a Hong Kong small time businessman. She attended the prestigious Diocesan Girls' School in Hong Kong, where was elected junior house captain. She sat the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination in 1978 and graduated in 1979. Upon her graduation, she went on to continue her education in Sydney, Australia at the University of New South Wales.[2][3]
Career[edit]
After living in Australia, Chau lived and worked in London during the 1980s for a short period of time. During the late 1980s, she befriended Debbie Chang, would eventually become one of her longest running business partners.
Chau's first notable achievement within Hong Kong business circles was winning a project to build the Oriental Square in downtown Beijing in 1993. This project, and many others during her early career were accomplished in involvement with former Hong Kong chief executive Tung Chee-hwa, Debbie Chang's cousin. Chau also met Li Ka-shing around this time, and the two would later become known for their close companionship and various business partnerships.
In 1999, with Li's help, Chau set up Tom, a Chinese language media comopany, as a Cayman Island registered limited company as a minority (40%) partner together with Hutchison Whampoa and Cheung Kong Holdings in a series of transactions which netted her an estimated USD 11 million in cash even before the company began to trade.[4] When Tom was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Chau's investment in Tom grew to UCS$1.63 billion, making her the then second-richest woman in Hong Kong.[3]
In 2002, Chau invested RMB ￥ 1 million into an interactive voice-recognition service provider, Beijing Leitingwuji Network Technology Company Limited (北京雷霆无极网络科技有限公司).[5] In September 2003, before the company was even profitable, she sold it to TOM Group for the sum of USD132 million. Its subsidiary TOM Online was then separately listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in early 2004.[4] Chau remained a 9.998% shareholder in Tom Online until 12 March 2007, when Tom Group announced an offer for the outstanding shares in Tom Online, to take the company private. Chau also has a 24% stake in TOM Group prior to the announcement.[6]
In 2002, Chau cofounded Horizons Ventures with Debbie Chang, who is the only person named as a director. Li Ka-shing only became an investor in the firm two years after its founding, but his backing as the richest man in Asia has helped the firm stand out above the crowd.[7] Under Chau, Horizons Ventures has invested over US$470 million in more than 80 tech companies, in search of "disruptive" tech entrepreneurs.[8] Its primary investments have been in the United States and Israel, with at least 28 investments in each country respectively since 2006.
Chau has personally stated that her business interests center around nurturing Western companies, viewing them as more innovative. Chau has been noted to invest in companies very quickly, sometimes within 24 hours of startup owners, or immediately after a short coffee meeting. Chau typically brings investments ranging anywhere from $1 million to $20 million to the table. Horizons was incorporated in Hong Kong in 2006. With her direction, the Li Ka-shing foundation has also invested in tech giants such as Facebook, Slack, and Spotify.[7]
She was named one of Forbes Asia's 50 Women in the Mix in 2013.[9] As of 2014, she is listed as the 81nd most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[10]
Personal life[edit]
Chau is well known for her decades long friendship with Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, who she met through a mutual friend in the 1990s. Li is 33 years her senior and is Chau's closest confidante, and the pair have backed and advised each other through many of their projects. Chau has been seen kneeling down in public to tie Li's shoelaces and holding his umbrella in the rain.[3] Chau has compared their relationship to that of Sancho Panza and Don Quixote.[1]
In 2012, Chau sued Hong Kong distributor of Beijing-based Caijing under accusations of defamation, with the magazine having made claims of Chau accepting bribes from a mainland government official. Mainland courts ruled in December 2012 that Beijin Caijing Magazine Limited was liable for defamation and ordered the company to publish an apology. Chau's camp has accepted these terms.[11]
