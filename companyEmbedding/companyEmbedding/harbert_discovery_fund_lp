Security and Issuer.            The name of the issuer is iCAD, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer").  The address of the Issuer's principal executive offices is: 98 Spit Brook Road, Suite 100, Nashua, New Hampshire, United States of America.  This Schedule 13D relates to the Issuer's common stock, $0.01 par value (the "Shares").                                Item 2.   Identity and Background.            (a), (f)   This Schedule 13D is being filed jointly by (i) Harbert Discovery Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Fund"), (ii) Harbert Discovery Fund GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Fund GP"), (iii) Harbert Fund Advisors, Inc., an Alabama corporation ("HFA"), (iv) Harbert Management Corporation, an Alabama corporation ("HMC"), (v) Jack Bryant, a United States citizen, (vi) Kenan Lucas, a United States citizen and (vii) Raymond Harbert, a United States citizen (collectively the "Reporting Persons").                            (b)   The principal business address for each of the Reporting Persons is 2100 Third Avenue North, Suite 600, Birmingham, Alabama 35203.                            (c)   Jack Bryant and Kenan Lucas, are directors and co-portfolio managers of the Fund GP, which serves as general partner of the Fund.  Raymond Harbert is the controlling shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HMC, an alternative asset investment management firm that is the managing member of the Fund GP.  Mr. Harbert also serves as the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director of HFA, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of HMC, which provides the Fund with certain operational and administrative services.  The principal business of the Fund is purchasing, holding and selling securities for investment purposes.                            (d)   None of the Reporting Persons have, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).                           (e)   Prior to March 2009, HMC was affiliated with the Harbinger Capital Partners Funds ("Harbinger") managed by Philip Falcone.  On June 27, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Falcone and Harbinger related to, among other things, their trading in the bonds of a small company known as MAAX Holdings in 2006-2008 that the SEC alleges to have been "manipulative" in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act").  The SEC also sought to hold HMC derivatively liable as a "control person" under Section 20(A) of the Exchange Act.  Section 20(A) is a derivative liability provision that does not prohibit any specified conduct and cannot be independently violated by one's own conduct, but imposes joint and several liability on certain persons who control another to the extent that such "controlled person" is independently liable for its own violations of the securities laws.  Except as set forth in this Item 2(e) none of the Reporting Persons have, during the last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding were or are subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.          Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.                       The funds for the purchase of the Shares by the Fund came from the working capital of the Fund, over which HFA, HMC, the Fund GP, Jack Bryant, Kenan Lucas and Raymond Harbert, through their roles described above in Item 2(c), exercise investment discretion.  No borrowed funds were used to purchase the Shares, other than borrowed funds used for working capital purposes in the ordinary course of business.  The total costs of the Shares directly owned by Harbert Discovery Fund, LP is approximately $3,352,243.14.                     Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction.                        The Reporting Persons purchased the securities of the Issuer reported herein based on their belief that the securities were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity.  On November 7, 2016, Jack Bryant and Kenan Lucas, the Directors and Co-Portfolio Managers of the Fund GP, sent a letter to Dr. Lawrence Howard, the Chairman of the Issuer's Board of Directors. The letter expresses disappointment in the Issuer's performance, and also calls on the Board and management of the Issuer to purchase shares in the open market, suspend Board cash compensation, hire a Chief Financial Officer, and if certain improvements are not made by 2Q17 to hire an investment banker to explore strategic alternatives. A copy of the full text of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit C.   The Reporting Persons have had conversations with the Issuer's management regarding possible ways to enhance shareholder value. The Reporting Persons intend to have further conversations with the Issuer's management and board of directors on a range of issues, including those relating to the business of the Issuer, management, board composition, operations, capital allocation, asset allocation, capitalization, dividend policy, financial condition, mergers and acquisitions strategy, overall business strategy, executive compensation, and corporate governance. The Reporting Persons may also have similar conversations with other stockholders of the Issuer and other interested parties, such as industry analysts, existing or potential strategic partners or competitors, investment professionals, and other investors. The Reporting Persons may at any time reconsider and change their intentions relating to the foregoing.  No Reporting Person has any present plan or proposal which would relate to or would result in any of the matters set forth in subparagraphs (a)- (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D except as set forth herein or such as would occur upon completion of any of the actions discussed herein. The Reporting Persons may in the future take one or more of the actions described in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D and may discuss such actions with the Issuer's management and the board of directors, other stockholders of the Issuer, and other interested parties, such as those set out above.   The Reporting Persons intend to review their investments in the Issuer on a continuing basis. Depending on various factors, including, without limitation, the Issuer's financial position and strategic direction, the outcome of the discussions and actions referenced above, actions taken by the Issuer's board of directors, price levels of the Common Stock, other investment opportunities available to the Reporting Persons, conditions in the securities market and general economic and industry conditions, the Reporting Persons may in the future take actions with respect to its investment position in the Issuer as it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, purchasing additional Common Stock or selling some of all of its Common Stock, and/or engaging in hedging or similar transactions with respect to the Common Stock.               Item 5.

(the "Company" or "iCAD") common shares. We maintain strong belief in iCAD's potential but are troubled by its recent performance. We feel management should take steps to attempt to restore shareholder confidence. Accordingly, in this letter we call on the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") and management team to purchase shares immediately in the open market, waive Board cash compensation until there is a material improvement in operational performance, and to pursue strategic alternatives should the business not experience a material improvement in revenue growth and business outlook by 2Q 2017. As long-term oriented shareholders, we see significant value in iCAD in both the Cancer Therapy and Cancer Detection segments. The Company has promising technology in its Cancer Therapy segment with the Xoft system. Indeed, the strong positive clinical data released at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) meeting in 2016 reinforced the clinical efficacy and systemic cost advantages of this emerging cancer therapy platform. As indicated on the last earnings call, the potential for 70-150 eBx Skin customers in the Therapy segment by the end of 2017 is also very promising in the near-term. Longer-term, we are pleased to hear of the potential applications of the Xoft System in prostate cancer and other indications, representing additional significant market opportunities. Equally important, the tomosynthesis Computer-Aided Detection solution and workflow tool ("3D CAD") is already showing strong promise in Europe where it is commercially available. We remain very encouraged by the strong reader study data submitted to the FDA earlier in the year, and we are hopeful that the product will ultimately be approved by the FDA. The installed business awaiting this 3D CAD product, as well as the potential for the next generation product, presents a compelling opportunity to be a technology leader and first-mover in breast tomosynthesis and cancer detection. Despite these promising developments, the most recent quarterly earnings released on November 2, 2016 were highly disappointing. HDF feels these earnings reflect neither the revenue generation potential of the business nor the characteristics of strong operational execution. With shares trading around $3.15/share, we feel it is incumbent on the Board and management team to immediately purchase common shares in the open market. Common shares are down 25% over the past year and down 49% since September 2016, and this follows the very challenged 2015 stock performance and reimbursement debacle. Given the strong growth potential in both business segments, iCAD's current enterprise value of 1.1x our 2017 sales expectations, puts the Company at a steep discount to peers and its considerable market opportunity.    After the pattern of mismanaged shareholder expectations and poor performance, shareholders are reluctant to place credence in management's guidance and the Board's oversight. Open market purchases of shares would signal faith in the business and the potential for 2017 to be a transformative year. HDF also feels the suspension of Board cash compensation until iCAD has shown multiple quarters of sustained improved performance would be a sign to shareholders that the Board understands the recent value deterioration and is committed to reversing that trend. Finally, the Board should make it a near-term priority to hire a high-quality Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"). Importantly, looking into next year, HDF feels that should iCAD not receive FDA approval for its 3D CAD product or demonstrate revenue growth potential by 2Q17, then the Board should hire an investment bank and immediately explore a range of strategic alternatives, including the sale of each segment independently. It is highly likely, given the standalone EBITDA characteristics of both business segments, that there would be motivated and interested buyers. Consider that a sum-of -the-parts analysis suggests the Cancer Detection business alone could be worth more than the enterprise value of the Company today, and that does not even account for the revenue potential of the 3D CAD product. We remain confident that 2017 will be a transformative year for iCAD. The Board and management team should immediately purchase shares on the open market to demonstrate their shared confidence in iCAD's future, as well as to help restore confidence among the investor community. Also, we implore the Board to move swiftly to improve the management team by hiring a first-rate CFO. Should the Company continue to struggle in 2017, the Board should engage an investment bank to explore strategic alternatives. HDF is optimistic iCAD can capitalize on the opportunities before it to improve performance. Should meaningful progress not be made, however, HDF will consider taking actions to drive change and prevent further value erosion for all iCAD stakeholders. We would welcome the opportunity to discuss any of our points at length. Thank you for your consideration.

to effect, seek, or offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise
and whether or not subject to conditions) to effect or seek or
become a participant in or (iii) in any way knowingly assist,
facilitate or encourage any other person to effect, seek, offer or

“proxies” to vote (as such terms are used in Regulation
14A of the Exchange Act) or consents for shareholder action in lieu
of a meeting (whether or not related to the election or removal of
directors) with respect to any common stock or other voting
securities of Perceptron or any of its subsidiaries, or the
initiation, proposal, encouragement or solicitation of shareholders
of Perceptron for the approval of any shareholder proposals,

with respect to Perceptron, or the solicitation, advisement or
influence of any person with respect to the voting of any common

b.            
make or cause to be made, or in any way encourage any other person

retain ownership of any common stock or other voting securities of
Perceptron, if when taken together with the common stock or other
voting securities of Perceptron beneficially owned by all of the
Holders and their affiliates and associates, in the aggregate,
would constitute more than 9.9% of the then outstanding common
stock or other voting securities of Perceptron; provided that
“beneficial ownership” shall have the meaning ascribed
thereto under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act; this 9.9%
threshold refers only to the voting securities beneficially owned
by the Holders and their affiliates and associates in the aggregate
and does not include any holdings of Moab Partners, LP. Moab
Capital Partners, LLC or Michael Rothenberg;

e.            
make any proposal, offer or public announcement involving, or
propose to enter into, or assist or encourage any other person with
respect to, directly or indirectly, any merger, consolidation,
business combination, tender or exchange offer, sale or purchase of
assets, sale or purchase of securities, dissolution, liquidation,
restructuring, recapitalization or similar transactions of or
involving Perceptron or take any action which would reasonably be
expected to require Perceptron to make a public announcement
regarding any of the foregoing actions; provided that nothing
herein shall limit Holders’ ability to discuss with the
Directors through non-public communications (which may, but need
not, be at a meeting of the Perceptron’s Board of Directors
(the “Board”)) or to propose as a Director through
non-public communications (which may, but need not, be at a meeting
of the Board) that the Board consider any of the foregoing types of
transactions, and to vote as a Director at a meeting of the Board
upon any such transaction. Nothing herein shall restrict the
ability of the Holders to make any filings under the Exchange Act
or any other securities laws that are legally required to be made,
as determined based on the advice of counsel (which advice need not
be a formal opinion of counsel) that is mutually acceptable to
Perceptron and the Holders, as a result of Jack Bryant proposing as
a Director through non-public communications that the Board
consider any of the foregoing types of transactions or vote at a
meeting of the Board upon any such transaction. Holders shall
provide Perceptron and its counsel with a copy of such filing
within a reasonable period (and, in any event, at least one
business day) in advance of filing such filing with the SEC in
order to provide Perceptron with a reasonable opportunity to review
such materials. Holders and Perceptron shall mutually agree on the
disclosure in such filing relating to such actions by Jack Bryant.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Holders and Perceptron
do not agree on the wording of the filing prior to the due date of
the filing, nothing herein shall prevent Holders from timely filing
such filing without incorporating Perceptron’s comments, if
they have, in good faith, taken reasonable efforts to incorporate
Perceptron’s comments into the applicable
materials;

 

    
f.            
Other than the current section 13 “group” that exists
between the Holders, Moab Capital Partners, LLC, Moab Partners, LP,
and Michael M. Rothenberg, which will be terminated promptly
following the execution of this Agreement and not reformed during
the term of this Agreement, form, join or in any way participate in
any “group” (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of
the Exchange Act) with respect to common stock or other voting
securities of Perceptron;

securities of Perceptron to any arrangement or agreement with
respect to the voting of any common stock or other voting
securities of Perceptron, including, without limitation, lend any
common stock or other voting securities of Perceptron to an person
or entity for the purpose of allowing such person or entity to vote

Item 1.

Security and Issuer.




The name of the issuer is iCAD, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer").  The address of the Issuer's principal executive offices is: 98 Spit Brook Road, Suite 100, Nashua, New Hampshire, United States of America.  This Schedule 13D relates to the Issuer's common stock, $0.01 par value (the "Shares").



Item 2.

Identity and Background.







(a), (f)

This Schedule 13D is being filed jointly by (i) Harbert Discovery Fund, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Fund"), (ii) Harbert Discovery Fund GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Fund GP"), (iii) Harbert Fund Advisors, Inc., an Alabama corporation ("HFA"), (iv) Harbert Management Corporation, an Alabama corporation ("HMC"), (v) Jack Bryant, a United States citizen, (vi) Kenan Lucas, a United States citizen and (vii) Raymond Harbert, a United States citizen (collectively the "Reporting Persons").







(b)

The principal business address for each of the Reporting Persons is 2100 Third Avenue North, Suite 600, Birmingham, Alabama 35203.







(c)

Jack Bryant and Kenan Lucas, are directors and co-portfolio managers of the Fund GP, which serves as general partner of the Fund. Raymond Harbert is the controlling shareholder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HMC, an alternative asset investment management firm that is the managing member of the Fund GP. Mr. Harbert also serves as the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Director of HFA, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of HMC, which provides the Fund with certain operational and administrative services. The principal business of the Fund is purchasing, holding and selling securities for investment purposes.







(d)

None of the Reporting Persons have, during the last five years, been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).







(e)

Prior to March 2009, HMC was affiliated with the Harbinger Capital Partners Funds ("Harbinger") managed by Philip Falcone. On June 27, 2012, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") filed civil fraud charges against Mr. Falcone and Harbinger related to, among other things, their trading in the bonds of a small company known as MAAX Holdings in 2006-2008 that the SEC alleges to have been "manipulative" in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). The SEC also sought to hold HMC derivatively liable as a "control person" under Section 20(A) of the Exchange Act. Section 20(A) is a derivative liability provision that does not prohibit any specified conduct and cannot be independently violated by one's own conduct, but imposes joint and several liability on certain persons who control another to the extent that such "controlled person" is independently liable for its own violations of the securities laws.  Except as set forth in this Item 2(e) none of the Reporting Persons have, during the last five years, been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding were or are subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.







Item 3.

Discovery Strategy
OverviewInvestment TeamContactOverviewHMC’s Discovery strategy seeks to generate long-term capital growth primarily through investments in small and microcap stocks in the U.S. and Canada. Our strategy is to identify “hidden gems” or deeply undervalued companies and assets among the vast number of smaller capitalization companies in North America. We perform rigorous due diligence and may take concentrated positions in less liquid securities, seeking to build large ownership stakes over time. By maintaining a focused portfolio, we are able to work closely with each company to see that it reaches its fullest potential.
