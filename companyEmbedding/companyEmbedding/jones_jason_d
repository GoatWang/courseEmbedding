      Selected Cases    




 Hoop Culture, Inc. v. The Gap, Inc. 

122 F. Supp. 3d 1338 (M.D. Fla. 2015), aff'd, 684 Fed.Appx. 981 (11th Cir. 2016)


Following an evidentiary hearing, on behalf of client The Gap, Inc. and its Old Navy brand, the Firm was successful in defeating a motion for a preliminary injunction brought by plaintiff Hoop Culture, Inc. over its alleged EAT...SLEEP...BALL. trademark. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida held that the plaintiff did not show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claims on either ownership of a valid mark - despite the fact that it had a federal registration - or likelihood of confusion. The Court also held that plaintiff failed to establish the requisite irreparable injury. This decision was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.



 Chanel, Inc. v. JC Fits, Inc.   

(S.D.N.Y. 2013)


Represented luxury goods plaintiff in a trademark infringement and dilution action. Secured consent judgment.



 Body Wisdom Media, Inc. v. Athleta, Inc. 

8:13-cv-02967-GJH (D. Md. Jan. 30, 2014)


The Firm successfully defeated a motion for a preliminary injunction motion on behalf of client Athleta, Inc., a leading retailer of women’s performance apparel and gear and part of The Gap, Inc.’s portfolio of companies. Plaintiff Body Wisdom Media, Inc. sought a preliminary injunction to stop Athleta’s use of a pinwheel design as a logo, alleging likelihood of confusion with Body Wisdom’s own pinwheel design logo used in connection with fitness DVDs. Athleta had adopted the challenged pinwheel logo seven years prior and had used it across its business since that time. The U.S. District Court in Maryland denied Body Wisdom’s motion, ruling that Body Wisdom was not likely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim, because, inter alia, the parties’ goods are different and had coexisted under the respective marks without confusion for a number of years. The court also held that any injunction would harm Athleta, which uses the challenged pinwheel design across its entire business.



 Pearson Education, Inc. et al v. Boundless Learning Inc. 

No. 12-cv-1986 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)


Represented Defendant Boundless Learning, Inc. (“Boundless”) in a recently settled case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York brought by three publishers of college-level textbooks in biology, economics and psychology, respectively. The publishers claimed Boundless infringed Plaintiffs’ copyrights in violation of the U.S. Copyright Act and engaged in unfair competition and false advertising under the U.S. Trademark Act by creating free, electronic textbooks for students that covered the same factual concepts and topics as Plaintiffs’ textbooks and were marketed as alternatives to their products.



 Frank Sinatra Enterprises, LLC v. Loizon 

Opp. No. 91198282 (T.T.A.B. Sept. 12, 2012)


The Firm successfully represented our client, Frank Sinatra Enterprises, LLC, which holds the exclusive right to commercially exploit Mr. Sinatra’s name and likeness, in its challenge before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to Michigan-based caterer Bill Loizon’s attempt to register the mark FRANKS ANATRA in connection with his catering business.



 Revelations Perfume v. Prince Rogers Nelson 

Index No. 603350/2008, Slip Op. (N.Y. Sup. Aug. 4, 2011)


The firm obtained partial summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff's entire $5.6 million claim for damages against our client Universal Music Corp. d/b/a Universal Music Publishing Group ("UMPG") in a license dispute concerning a celebrity fragrance for Prince, the famous recording artist.



 Clinique Laboratories LLC v. Absolute Dental, LLC 

2011 WL 1652171 (T.T.A.B. 2011)


On behalf of our client Clinique Laboratories LLC—owner of the famous CLINIQUE trademark in connection with cosmetics and cosmetic services—we successfully opposed Absolute Dental LLC’s attempt to register the trademark CLINIQUE DENTIQUE for “cosmetic dentistry services” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.



 Institute for the Development of Earth Awareness v. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 

768 F. Supp. 2d 672 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)


The firm obtained summary judgment in favor of client, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (“PETA”), dismissing copyright infringement claim brought against PETA in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on basis of alleged use in PETA animal rights campaign of historical facts and not-new idea of comparing mistreatment of slaves in 19th century America to mistreatment of animals today.



 Perfetti Van Melle USA v. Cadbury Adams USA LLC 

732 F. Supp. 2d 712 (E.D. Ky. 2010)


On behalf of our client Cadbury Adams USA LLC--maker of the famous DENTYNE brand of chewing gum--we defeated a motion for a preliminary injunction brought by plaintiff which sought to block the launch of Cadbury's new breath purifying gum, DENTYNE PURE, on the grounds that the name DENTYNE PURE was confusingly similar to plaintiffs' MENTOS PURE FRESH and MENTOS PURE WHITE names used for chewing gum.

How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Jones, Jason D carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Jones, Jason D currently holds license JONESJD840DH , which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Jones, Jason D



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Jones, Jason D



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
