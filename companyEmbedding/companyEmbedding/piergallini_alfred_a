 Home→CollectionsAlfred A. Piergallini, Gerber Products Co. Freed Of Non-performers, Gerber ReboundsEXECUTIVE INTERVIEWMay 27, 1991|by CONSTANCE WALKER, The Morning Call"We got in the car at the hospital -- I'll never forget this. We were in Cincinnati and the nurse handed my wife this kid, our newborn daughter. So I'm driving away and I looked at my wife and said, `Now, you know how to take care of this kid, don't you?' She said, `I haven't the slightest idea.'"Alfred A. Piergallini, a native of Easton, tells the story with a hearty laugh. It seems incongruous that this man, who admittedly once thought baby care was a genetic inheritance, now runs the company that is synonymous with babies -- Gerber Products Co.Piergallini became chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of the Michigan-based company at the turn of the year in 1990 following David Johnson, who left to head Campbell Soup Co.The food industry was not new to Piergallini; he had worked at Sara Lee Corp. and Carnation Co. By then, babies also were not new; he has a 16-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son.Now the challenge was to continue what Johnson started -- helping Gerber Products gain back what it lost in the 1980s because of overdiversification -- and preparing the company for the future, including expanding the product menu and the company's geographical reaches in the face of strong competition by corporation giants such as Philip Morris Cos., Nestle S.A. and H.J. Heinz Co.During the last fiscal year, which ended March 31, Gerber had total sales of about $1.2 billion -- food, baby-care items, apparel and life insurance -- and captured 70.3 percent of the total baby-food market.Recently, while visiting Easton Area High School -- where he graduated in 1964 -- Piergallini talked about changes in Gerber Products, trends in the baby-care industry and his philosophy of business.Question: What kind of trends are you experiencing in the baby-food industry and how does that play into Gerber's plans?Piergallini: Our mission for the total company is in the feeding, caring and clothing children from zero to about 3 years of age. We want to dominate that category with Gerber products.The trends in our business are driven by birth rates. The birth rate nationally is up about 3.9 percent, about 4 million births a year, give or take a few.We entered the baby-formula business about 18 months ago. That came about because of our mission and that starts with the formula. We believe breast-feeding is the best way to take care of babies. But if you can't breast feed, or in some cases women supplement breast-feeding, we want you to try Gerber.A trend that negatively affected us is the early substitution of table foods when mom decides the kid should eat mashed potatoes and Spaghetti-Os. But none of those foods are formulated for that age group. Research tells us mother uses that because it's convenient, but it has high sodium, high fat and a lot of sugar.So, what we're doing is trying to extend the consumption cycle by developing a toddler transitional food category -- Gerber Graduates. This would carry us from the 11-month-old up to about 36 months. We recently started rolling out the main meals -- the first element in that toddler category. We're hopeful that, by the end of this fiscal year, we'll have a whole series under the Gerber Graduates name that might include snacks, side dishes and juices.There's a big amount of consumption beyond 11 months that we're not really taking advantage of now because when mothers give up baby food, they give up us.Q: How has the shift in environmental awareness affected Gerber?Piergallini: The nutrition and environmental consciousness is all in our favor. The trend in the U.S. is going back to cloth diapers because of the environmental push. We are the largest cloth diaper manufacturer in the United States. The issue we are facing now is strong imports and they are tough to fight because of the price is so much lower -- we make all of our diapers domestically.We've got a great new diaper we just developed called "The Easy One" for newborns. It's with velcro straps; no pins. We're testing it in a number of hospitals. But one thing we will never be able to beat in disposables -- and they are a good product -- is convenience.Q: Is there a problem with marketing cloth diapers since the women having babies now probably have never used cloth diapers before and don't know how?Piergallini: Most people don't know how to use (cloth diapers). They'd like to, but they think it's going to be really difficult and it isn't. That's why we've recently come out with a diaper kit -- two dozen diapers, pins, diaper liners, vinyl pants, diaper cover and a video tape.The tape shows how to take care of the baby, but the whole idea was `Here's how you use cloth diapers; here's how you fold them; here's how you put them on the kid.' It even gives you the different folds for the girl and boy. It costs about $25, but you go home, open it up and you can do it.Q: More and more companies are looking beyond U.S. borders to global markets. What is Gerber doing to go beyond?1 | 2 |  Next

New Gerber President Called Sound Manager


By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times


Published: January 4, 1990









DETROIT, Jan. 3— 
                    Alfred A. Piergallini today was named president and chief executive of the Gerber Products Company, succeeding David W. Johnson, who will take the top posts at the Campbell Soup Company.        

                    Mr. Piergallini, who had been chief operating officer, has been with the baby-food concern for only nine months. Yet his relative inexperience is hardly a drawback at Gerber, where a thorough restructuring by the departing chief executive, Mr. Johnson, changed the corporate culture and turned the company around in two years.        

                    Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Piergallini is largely unknown outside the company, but has built a solid reputation managing Gerber's operations.        

                    ''That's what Gerber needs right now, a strong operations guy,'' said Kurt A. Feuerman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert.        

                    Renewed Focus on Baby Food        

                    Mr. Piergallini, who is 43 years old, inherits a company that is prospering. A renewed focus on baby food pushed earnings up 32 percent, to $53.3 million, in the first six months of the 1989 fiscal year. Analysts say Gerber is on track to earn about $2.75 a share when its fiscal year ends in March, compared with $2.17 last year.        

                    Mr. Piergallini joined Gerber, based in Fremont, Mich., after working for a variety of consumer-products concerns. Most recently he was senior vice president of the Carnation Company. He came to Mr. Johnson's attention after expanding Carnation's market share in pet food.        

                    When he was hired at Gerber in April, those familiar with the company expected him to succeed Mr. Johnson eventually. But the change in leadership came sooner than some had expected, despite rumors that Mr. Johnson was considering an offer from Campbell.        

                    Mr. Piergallini, who said his management philosophy is ''identical'' to Mr. Johnson's, will not tinker with the profit machine that Mr. Johnson has created at Gerber. Instead, he emphasized his plans to follow through on the divestitures that began under Mr. Johnson, and said he hoped to squeeze even more profit from the baby food business through wider distribution and some new food products, including a line of milk-based baby formula.        

                    Criticism of Advertisements        

                    The American Academy of Pediatricians has criticized Gerber for aiming at consumers rather than doctors with advertisements for its new line of baby formula, which became available last summer. The pediatricians have said Gerber's advertising campaign undermines their efforts to encourage breast-feeding.        

                    Mr. Piergallini said the opposition to the marketing strategy ''has not appeared to adversely affect the introduction of our formula product.''        

                    The company is under pressure to establish its milk-based formula, which is manufactured by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and sold by Gerber under a joint agreement. Gerber tried to enter the market in 1967 with a formula called Modilac, but it was discontinued in 1972.        

                    The company expects profits from its new formula to be about $1 million to $4 million annually by 1992. To accomplish that, Gerber will have to raise the price of the formula by 6 to 7 percent each year, said William Maguire, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.        

                    Sale of Day-Care Centers        

                    Mr. Piergallini said his first job was to complete the sale of a national chain of day-care centers, which he acknowledges ''will not realize any significant gain'' for Gerber. He also intends to follow through on the company's plans, announced in November, to close a baby food plant in Niagara Falls, Ontario.        

                    Some Wall Street analysts have alerted investors to sell their Gerber shares, believing that the company can go no higher without Mr. Johnson as its guide. But other analysts familiar with the company suggested that Gerber still had potential to grow.        

                    ''The simple fact that Al Piergallini is in charge does not reduce Gerber's earnings,'' Mr. Maguire said.        

                    Gerber stock fell 62.5 cents yesterday, to $46.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Novartis Appoints Piergallini President and CEO



Novartis (Summit, NJ) has appointed Alfred Piergallini as president and CEO of Novartis Consumer Health (NCH) North America. Piergallini will oversee the U.S. and Canadian operations of four NCH businesses: Gerber Products Company, Novartis Medical Nutrition, Novartis OTC (over-the-counter medicines), and the newly formed Novartis Health and Functional Nutrition business unit.




Piergallini will report directly to Thomas Ebeling, global head of Novartis Consumer Health, and is a member of the worldwide Novartis Consumer Health Executive Committee.




Since 1990, Piergallini has been vice chairman, president and CEO of Gerber Products Company, a Novartis company. With nearly 30 years of marketing and operating experience, Piergallini specializes in brand building and maximizing customer satisfaction.




Assuming Piergallini's position as president and CEO of Gerber Products Company will be Frank Palantoni, who joined Novartis in late 1998 as EVP at Gerber. Prior to joining Novartis, Palantoni spent 10 years with the Group Danone, where he became GM of the New Ventures Group for the Dannon Company North America.




In addition, Novartis appointed Robert Wilson VP of the newly formed Novartis Health and Functional Nutrition Business Unit. The new uit will leverage existing brand equities by developing food and dietary supplement products. The business unit will also investigate potential joint ventures, strategic alliances, and acquisitions.




Wilson, who joined Novartis in late 1998, had previously been with Johnson & Johnson, where he was group product director for new market development, working on cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals. Fred Huser will continue as president and CEO of Novartis OTC in North America, a position he has held since the formation of the company in early 1997. Palantoni and Wilson will both report to Piergallini.




In August 1998, Novartis announced plans to merge the company's self-medication and nutrition businesses, forming the new Consumer Health Division. The first phases of this integration, including the divestiture of Red Line HealthCare and other non-core brands, already have been completed. Moving forward, NCH is further focusing its nutrition businesses on health and science-based nutrition and functional foods. In functional foods, Novartis will focus its efforts in areas such as disorders of the cardiovascular, digestive and immune systems, and osteoporosis.
