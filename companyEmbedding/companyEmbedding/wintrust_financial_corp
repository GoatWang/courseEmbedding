Business Highlight

Bucketfeet







Raaja Nemani and Aaron Firestein met in Argentina. Before parting ways, Aaron drew a design for Raaja on a pair of canvas sneakers. The shoes sparked conversations across six continents. By the end of Raaja’s trip, he knew these shoes could be something bigger and BucketFeet was born. The pair have worked hard, and worn a few different hats (and shoes), to create a company that’s about more than shoes.

CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
