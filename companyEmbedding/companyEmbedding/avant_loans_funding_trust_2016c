Loans for Many Purposes | Avant



































































Loan Uses












A personal loan through Avant can be used for almost any situation. Whether you are looking for a simple way to consolidate your debt, planning a home improvement project or dealing with an unexpected life event.  Avant may be able to help, right when you need it the most.

Debt Consolidation
Debt Consolidation Loans
Consolidate one or more unsecured debts – such as your credit card balances – into one, easy-to-manage monthly payment. Unlike some other products, loans through Avant have a fixed interest rate and a set term.
Home Improvement
Home Improvement Loans
When you have loans through Avant, you don’t have to use your savings, or even the equity in your home, to fund your home improvement projects. You are free to make whatever repairs or renovations your home needs.
Unexpected Expenses
Emergency Loans
Avant may make it easier to deal with the unexpected. While there are things no one can plan for, receiving a loan through Avant and having the funds deposited directly into your bank account can help ease your burden during times of emergency.

















All unsecured installment loans issued through Avant are made by WebBank, member FDIC.


Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $35,000. APR ranges from 9.95% to 35.99%. Loan lengths range from 24 to 60 months. Administration fee ranges from 0.95% to 4.75%

Avant made me feel like a valued customer and I feel empowered to chart my own path after receiving my loan through Avant. Many many thanks.

Mark W., Summerville, SC





The experience with Avant was great, very easy to apply and the customer service individual that helped me with the process was outstanding.

— LMae A., Jackson, SC





Avant allows a loan to be paid early with no additional penalties. Thats really unheard of. Thanks again!

— Brian S., San Diego, CA





I was impressed with the convenience and very helpful customer service. The approval process was streamlined and not complicated. I had been declined by my local bank for a personal loan, I am very grateful to Avant!

— Gladys F., Los Angeles, CA





The process was smooth and I received my funds the very next business day. I would highly recommend Avant to anyone looking for financial assistance.

— Daryl D., Lynn, MA





Avant was very nice, very efficient, very quick and very reasonable with the interest rate.

— Patty T., Wharton, TX







Very user-friendly service and quick response time. The agent on the phone stayed with me until my application was complete. This expedited the process and gave me confidence. He was well equipped to answer my questions. Also, my loan was paid out the next day. That was fabulous. Again, a no hassle experience!

— Heidi I., Chicago, IL





The customer service rep that I spoke to was awesome. He verified my identity and the money was in the bank the very next morning. It was an easy and awesome experience. Thank you for being there for me.

— Irma I., Bryan, TX





Recently I had a emergency and needed to get help quick. I went to their website which was clear and informative, filled out the quick and easy application and their representative were courteous, quick, and very helpful. In no time at all I had the check in my account. Thank you Avant for being there.

— Lois M., Chicago, IL





We are using the money to pay for the expenses involved with adopting a sixteen year old daughter who came from a very troubled family. It was certainly something we hadn't budgeted for but when we heard her story we knew what we had to do. The loan through Avant allowed us to cover the costs of furniture, lawyers, and everything else necessary to complete the adoption.

— David S., Queen Creek, AZ

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

"Spare of the moment to decide to go to …"
Spare of the moment to decide to go to them, entire transaction was explained and good to go in a couple hours.  All was put into motion before the next billing cycle of creditors due date.  I would recommend this one over the many I receive by mail, they didn't contact me I went to them and they listened.  Staff is very courteous and considerate, understanding you as a person and in my case didn't choose to be in this financial position but bad stuff happens.

The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Lending billions is just the beginning for Chicago startup Avant

Chicago startup Avant has made a killing loaning money to people who regular banks won't touch. Now, it's looking for new ways to bet on borrowers with blemished credit scores.Since CEO Al Goldstein ⇒ co-founded the online lender more than three years ago, it has issued more than $3 billion in loans and grown to 950 employees in Chicago, Los Angeles and London.With a nearly $2 billion valuation, it's one of Chicago's rare startups in the ranks of the "unicorns" — privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion. The company recently added two new names with national firepower to its ranks. With scrutiny of online lenders ramping up, Avant brought ex-FDIC chairwoman Sheila Bair on to its board for her regulatory expertise. And it hired Brooke Skinner Ricketts, a former head of brand strategy at Twitter who is married to Chicago Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts, as vice president of brand and design.

If you haven’t heard of Avant yet, you will soon.With plans for a credit card this summer and a slew of other new products, it’s beginning to grow beyond its bread-and-butter business — providing personal loans to middle-class consumers turned down by traditional banks.Its algorithmic technology determines whether the company will lend and helps set an annual interest rate from 10 to 36 percent. (Options for below-prime borrowers can reach much higher; other types of loans, like online payday loans, hit triple-digit interest rates.)Avant's average customer has a FICO credit score of 650 and household income between $50,000 and $100,000, someone who may have a few thousand dollars in credit card debt or who might need cash for an emergency. Its average loan size is $8,000.














Avant, led by cofounder and CEO Al Goldstein, moved into a new Loop office in late January, and today employs 950 in Chicago, Los Angeles and London. (Meg Graham, Blue Sky)



“These are customers who are getting declined from traditional banks — they only have a credit card, and that credit card has at most $1,000 cap on it,” said Adam Hughes, chief operating officer. “So if they need to fix their car, they need to fix their boiler, they have a medical expense, they need a better product to handle that emergency.” Avant aims to pare out just the right slice of the borrowing demographic: customers who don’t quite make the cut at regular banks, but who have enough regular income to be decent risks to repay the loans along with their sizable interest. It made $300 million in revenue in 2015.To continue to grow — it's aiming for $600 million this year — Avant plans to offer these same customers even more options.“We want to expand from a personal (loan) company into a multiproduct platform that’s really fulfilling the needs” of middle-class consumers, Hughes said. In March, it announced it would offer auto refinance loans. It also inked a deal with Regions Bank, which will use Avant's platform to make loans starting later this year. Regions also will refer customers who don't meet its loan criteria to Avant. “For those customers that don’t have that 700-plus FICO score … those customers were getting declined,” Hughes said. “Now, they’re going to see a nice pop-up saying, ‘You’re not eligible for a Regions personal loan, but would you like to be considered by our partner Avant?’”Avant is in “advanced stages” with more banks for similar partnerships, Hughes said.Next up: credit cards. The company hopes to begin offering its card, in partnership with MasterCard, in August, he said. The card can be an entry point for customers who don't qualify for loans.Avant is also considering offering other products like mortgages or home equity lines of credit. Massive growth isn't new for CEO Goldstein, 35. He co-founded online lender Enova International, then called CashNetUSA, and sold it for $265 million in 2006. He also began Pangea Properties, a real estate investment trust that rehabs distressed properties. He started Avant under the name Avant Credit with John Sun and Paul Zhang.That gives Goldstein a “been there, done that” kind of story, said Mark Tebbe ⇒, chairman of ChicagoNext, the mayor's tech council, and a board member at Enova. “He’s a proven entrepreneur,” Tebbe said. “Anytime we can have an entrepreneur who’s now on his third venture, that’s a good thing.”Tebbe also noted Goldstein’s ability to lure high-profile hires to the company. “He’s got a great reach, and everyone knows him,” Tebbe said. “People like working with him. He’s pulled in some amazing people.”The company celebrated the opening of an 80,000-square-foot space at 222 N. LaSalle St. in March with Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and a packed house of Chicago business guests.But challenges lie ahead.Other online lenders have entered the scene, catering to different swaths of borrowers — among them SoFi and Prosper. But Avant is the biggest player in its target of 600 to 700 FICO scores, said Peter Renton, co-founder of LendIt, an online lending conference. He publishes a blog on the industry. “There are plenty of people who compete at some point on that spectrum with Avant,” he said. However, “most focus a little more on the prime borrowers.”Avant relies upon huge influxes of money from investors, who have included JP Morgan Chase and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. Some of the other sources of funding that drive the company are slowing down, though.“The securitization market is certainly not as vibrant as it was even three months ago,” Renton said. “The biggest challenge the industry is facing now is getting investor dollars in the door.”More government scrutiny is on the way, too.The Treasury Department is beginning to consider new ways online lenders might be regulated. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a watchdog group in the Federal Reserve System, also began accepting complaints pertaining to online lenders last month. And industry watchers are considering how online lenders might weather an economic downturn. 

“As the economy goes south and people lose their jobs, they stop paying these types of loans first,” said Brandon Barford, partner at Washington, D.C.-based firm Beacon Policy Advisors.As Avant looks for new territory, it also plans to widen its geographic reach. Outside the U.S., it’s now operating in parts of Canada and the United Kingdom, with plans to launch in Australia and possibly other countries.“Brazil I think is pretty interesting. Maybe Mexico; we’ll have to do a deeper dive there,” Hughes said. “If we want to be a really big player, which we do, we think a global view is really important.”  mgraham@tribpub.comTwitter @megancgraham

Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to Avant Loans Funding Trust 2016-C | Business Wire
























































Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to Avant Loans 
      Funding Trust 2016-C






August 02, 2016 05:36 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigns preliminary ratings to three 
      classes of notes issued by Avant Loans Funding Trust 2016-C (“AVNT 
      2016-C”). This is a $200 million consumer loan ABS transaction that is 
      expected to close on August 11, 2016.
    

      This transaction represents Avant, Inc.’s (“Avant” or the “Company”) 
      third rated securitization collateralized by a trust certificate backed 
      by unsecured consumer loans originated under its online marketplace 
      lending platform (“Avant Platform”). There have been four prior 
      unrated securitizations, in which Avant or Avant’s institutional 
      investors were the sponsors and the collateral was unsecured consumer 
      loans originated under the Avant Platform.
    

      Founded in 2012, Avant is located in Chicago, Illinois and operates an 
      online lending platform. Personal installment loans are offered to 
      non-prime consumers through the Avant Platform. Typical customers have 
      an average annual income of $61,000 and average FICO score of 580 - 720. 
      Loans typically have an original term of between 24 – 60 months, an 
      original balance between $1,000 and $35,000 and a fixed APR between 
      9.95% - 36.00% depending on the borrower’s risk profile and loan term. 
      Borrowers are not charged an application fee, origination fee or any 
      prepayment penalties on the loans. For the 6 months ended June 30, 2016, 
      $971 million was originated through the Avant Platform, down from $1.2 
      billion during the 6 months ended December 30, 2015.
    

      Avant retains a portion of loans originated through the Avant Platform. 
      Avant does not fund loans through a peer-to-peer platform, but instead 
      partners exclusively with institutional investors for whole loan sales.
    

      The transaction has initial credit enhancement levels of 56.85% for the 
      Class A Notes, 31.50% for the Class B Notes and 19.30% for the Class C 
      Notes. Credit enhancement consists of overcollateralization, 
      subordination in the case of the Class A and Class B Notes and a reserve 
      account funded at closing.
    

      KBRA applied its General Rating Methodology for Asset-Backed Securities 
      as part of its analysis of the transaction’s underlying collateral pool, 
      the proposed capital structure and the Avant Platform’s historical gross 
      loss data. KBRA also conducted an operational assessment of the Avant 
      Platform, as well as a review of the transaction’s legal structure and 
      transaction documents. KBRA will also review the operative agreements 
      and legal opinions for the transaction prior to closing.

Loans for Many Purposes | Avant



































































Loan Uses












A personal loan through Avant can be used for almost any situation. Whether you are looking for a simple way to consolidate your debt, planning a home improvement project or dealing with an unexpected life event.  Avant may be able to help, right when you need it the most.

Debt Consolidation
Debt Consolidation Loans
Consolidate one or more unsecured debts – such as your credit card balances – into one, easy-to-manage monthly payment. Unlike some other products, loans through Avant have a fixed interest rate and a set term.
Home Improvement
Home Improvement Loans
When you have loans through Avant, you don’t have to use your savings, or even the equity in your home, to fund your home improvement projects. You are free to make whatever repairs or renovations your home needs.
Unexpected Expenses
Emergency Loans
Avant may make it easier to deal with the unexpected. While there are things no one can plan for, receiving a loan through Avant and having the funds deposited directly into your bank account can help ease your burden during times of emergency.

















All unsecured installment loans issued through Avant are made by WebBank, member FDIC.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

Loan Disclosures


This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.

Oh what a blessing National Debt Relief is to me. From the first conversation up until this time they have set me free from sleepless nights of "how am I going to make it". Don't hesitate any longer. Try them. You will be glad you did.  Thank you National Debt Relief.

"Spare of the moment to decide to go to …"
Spare of the moment to decide to go to them, entire transaction was explained and good to go in a couple hours.  All was put into motion before the next billing cycle of creditors due date.  I would recommend this one over the many I receive by mail, they didn't contact me I went to them and they listened.  Staff is very courteous and considerate, understanding you as a person and in my case didn't choose to be in this financial position but bad stuff happens.

Are you in over your head in debt? Are you barely making ends meet? Use our free debt calculator to calculate your debt to income ratio and see how risky your financial situation.
1. Enter in your total unsecured debt – this includes credit cards, personal loans, medical bills and other unsecured debts.
2. Enter in your average interest rate on your debts. Add up the APRs on your credit cards and then divide by the number of credit cards to get the average interest rate.
3. Enter in your desired program length (enter # of months) – the lower the number the higher your monthly program payment and the higher the number the lower your monthly payment.
4. Press calculate and see how long it will take you to get out of debt with the popular debt reduction methods.






The Debt Calculator
This is a free debt analysis that starts with your monthly income before taxes and then asks for some common expenses like your monthly rent or mortgage payment, your car payment, and debt payments.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
