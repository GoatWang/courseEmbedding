      Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower covered up UFO sighting in England, letter claims Churchill, Eisenhower covered up UFO sighting in England: letter   BY  Michael Sheridan   DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Thursday, August 5, 2010, 11:47 AM     facebook   Tweet   email          In a letter sent to England's Ministry of Defense, a man claimed that Winston Churchill and then-General Dwight Eisenhower conspired to cover up UFO sighting during World War II. (Getty)       BY  Michael Sheridan   DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER Thursday, August 5, 2010, 11:47 AM    It's an international conspiracy worthy of the "X-Files." British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower covered up a UFO sighting during World War II in an effort to prevent mass panic, a letter sent to the British government suggests. The missive was one of thousands of documents related to the sighting of unidentified flying objects released by the United Kingdom's National Archives on Wednesday. This is the second mass release of UFO-related documents this year, and the sixth since 2008. The latest collection spans from 1995 to 2003. A letter sent in 1999 by an unnamed person from Leicester, England, relays a story he was told by his mother, which came from his grandfather, who claimed to have witnessed the alleged cover-up. "It is claimed that my grandfather, [REDACTED] was present during a debate between Winston Churchill and Mr. Eisenhower during World War II involving making a decision about an unexpected incident," the letter states, dated Sept. 20, 1999. The incident in question took place off the English coast and involved a Royal Air Force bomber crew, which was returning from a "photographic mission" in either Germany or France.  "The aircraft was intercepted by an object of unknown origin," the letter explains, "which matched course and speed with the aircraft for a time and then underwent an extremely rapid acceleration away." Photos and/or film were supposedly captured of the object, which "hovered noiselessly" and seemed metallic.      In a letter sent to England's Ministry of Defense, a man claimed that Winston Churchill and then-General Dwight Eisenhower conspired to cover up UFO sighting during World War II.    The incident sparked a discussion between Churchill and General Eisenhower, presumably via telephone, who commanded the Allied forces during the later period of the war.According to the letter, the grandfather who witnessed the conversation heard Churchill state: "This event should be immediately classified since it would create mass panic amongst the general population and destroy one's belief in the Church."The writer of the letter claims to not be a "crackpot," but explains that his interest is purely scientific, having heard the story for so many years.According to the reply sent by the Ministry of Defense, which received the letter, documents relating to UFO are destroyed after five years when a threat to national security is not involved."Any 'UFO' report files from the WWII era would most probably have been destroyed," the reply letter, dated Sept. 30, 1999, states.The massive collection of letters, all of which have had the names and addresses blacked out, include an array of stories of people who have spotted UFOs or claim to have come in contact with alien lifeforms.One woman sent a hand-written letter in 1997 relating her experience with alien abduction, in which she details a list of aliens, and their locations around the world, which included "Stargate Aliens" in America, as well as spider people in Russia.There are also letters relating to "Britain's Roswell," an incident that took place in 1980 in Rendlesham Forest, outside an RAF base, as well as several seeking to expose England's version of "Area 51," Rudloe Manor. msheridan@nydailynews.com; or follow him at Twitter.com/NYDNSheridan Send a Letter to the Editor  Join the Conversation:  facebook   Tweet
