                Lowering Interest Rate Risk 
Without Sacrificing Yield
            

SHAG: WisdomTree Barclays Yield Enhanced U.S. Short-Term Aggregate Bond Fund
In today’s fixed income markets, the ability for investors to maintain the appropriate balance between risk and return remains extremely challenging.  In many instances, decreasing interest rate risk means a significant reduction in yield. While this may be conventional wisdom, there are alternatives to that line of thinking.
The WisdomTree Barclays Yield Enhanced U.S. Short-Term Aggregate Bond Fund (SHAG) offers investors:

The potential to lower interest rate risk while simultaneously enhancing income.
An approach for minimizing interest rate risk  in the core  of their portfolio without having to sacrifice yield.
A cost-efficient alternative to traditional short-term, income exposure.

The Fund
This investment offering provides broad exposure to a high-quality portfolio of U.S. Government and U.S. Government Agency bonds, with limited exposure to non-investment-grade credit sectors. Managed by Andrew Szczurowski since 2014, the Fund seeks to pr ovide a core fixed income solution for investor portfolios. As a low duration strategy, the fund provides limited interest-rate risk, as its average duration will not exceed three years.



The Approach
The Fund's strategy draws upon Eaton Vance's decades of experience actively managing high-quality government bond portfolios. The investment team applies a time-tested process centered upon a combination of fundamental research and relative value trading . The Fund invests in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities as well as U.S. government-issued Treasury bills and bonds, with flexibility to invest up to 10% in securities of any credit rating.



The Features
Designed for income investors wishing to mitigate portfolio risk through a high-quality allocation, the Fund may be complementary to many lower-quality segments of the fixed-income markets. With a typically attractive yield advantage over comparable matu rity government bond mutual funds of similar duration and quality, the Fund may serve as a core holding for building diversified income portfolios. Managed by Eaton Vance, a government bond investing leader.

Portfolio Management




 
Andrew Szczurowski, CFA


Managed Fund since 2014






Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in one or more affiliated investment companies (Portfolios) and may also invest directly. Unless otherwise noted, referen ces to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund, including its pro rata share of each Portfolio or Fund in which it invests.


About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Securities with longer durations tend to be more  sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter durations. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and ex tension risks. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perce ived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. While certain U.S. government-sponsored agencies may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.  Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying i nstrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collater al or other assets held by the counterparty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectu s for a complete description.



1. Class A and I Ratings: 3-year: 5 and 5 stars, respectively; 5-year: 5 and 5 stars, respectively; 10-year: 4 and 5 stars, respectively. The total number of funds in the Short Government category for the 3, 5 and 10 year periods are 105, 95, 73, respective ly. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for  36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating  formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.
2. BofA Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index is an unmanaged index of short-term U.S. Treasury securities.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
Financial markets posted widespread gains in the first quarter. Key themes driving the broad rally included optimism about the Trump Administration's pro-growth agenda, stronger European economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets.
Treasury yields finished the quarter almost exactly where they began, but it was a volatile quarter with yields touching multi-year highs before retracing lower in the last two weeks. The initial move higher was aided by a newly hawkish Federal Reserve ( the Fed), emboldened by expansionary fiscal policy in the U.S. and receding risks to stability abroad. The market's rosy outlook turned negative in the last two weeks of the quarter following the Administration's failure to pass healthcare reform and ris ing uncertainty surrounding French elections and North Korea.
Entering the second quarter, the market must weigh an economy potentially running hot at 4.5% unemployment (the lowest reading since March 2007) versus the increasingly dangerous geopolitical landscape. Importantly, it seems the Fed is more concerned wit h the former as they have increased talk of winding down their $4.2trn balance sheet at the end of the year in an attempt to tighten financial conditions before inflationary pressures build too much.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Short Duration Government Income Fund (the Fund) outperformed its benchmark, the BofA Merrill Lynch 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index (the Index)2, at net asset value for the quarter.

The Fund benefited from a slowdown in Agency MBS prepayment rates due to the backup in mortgage rates which occurred during the fourth quarter.
The Fund's investments in floating rate Agency CMOs benefited from rising rates on the short end of the yield curve, as the securities' coupons reset higher.

Contributors 
The Fund's investments in floating rate Agency CMOs were a leading driver of performance and benefited from rising rates on the short end of the yield curve, as the securities' coupons reset higher.

The Fund's investments in fixed rate Agency CMOs also aided performance during the period as these securities outperformed Treasuries despite slight spread widening.



Detractors 
The Fund's investments in interest only Agency MBS were a slight drag on performance despite slowing prepayment speeds during the quarter.


Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
Management believes that although the U.S. economy remains on a solid footing, the likelihood of tail risk events which could have a positive or negative impact on financial markets have increased due to the change in U.S. political leadership and the gr owing geopolitical uncertainties. Against this backdrop, management believes Agency MBS remain an attractive investment opportunity, as they provide investors with an attractive spread over Treasuries without taking credit risk.
In the current low yield environment, it is important not to reach for yield and be mindful of interest-rate risk. As such, management believes Agency MBS with minimal extension risk and more stable prepayment profiles remain extremely attractive in the  current rate environment.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Securities with longer durations tend to be more  sensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter durations. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and ex tension risks. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perce ived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. While certain U.S. government-sponsored agencies may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.  Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying i nstrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collater al or other assets held by the counterparty. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectu s for a complete description.

Vanguard share class options






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

NAVFor funds with a fluctuating price per share, the net asset value (NAV) is the market value of a mutual fund's total assets, minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

Fees and minimums
Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

* Credit-quality ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). ”NR” is used to classify securities for which a rating is not available. NR securities may include a fund’s investment in Vanguard Market Liquidity Fund or Vanguard Municipal Cash Management Fund, each of which invests in high-quality money market instruments and may serve as a cash management vehicle for the Vanguard funds, trusts, and accounts. U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency, and U.S. Agency mortgage-backed securities appear under ”U.S. Government.” Credit-quality ratings for each issue are obtained from Barclays using ratings derived from Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). When ratings from all three agencies are available, the median rating is used. When ratings are available from two of the agencies, the lower rating is used. When one rating is available, that rating is used.

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
The fund is designed for investors with a low tolerance for risk; however, the fund’s performance could be hurt by:Interest rate risk: The chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates. Interest rate risk should be low for the fund because it invests primarily in short-term bonds, whose prices are much less sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of long-term bonds.Income risk: The chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates.Credit risk: The chance that a bond issuer will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Credit risk should be low for the fund because it purchases only bonds that are of investment-grade quality.Index sampling risk: The chance that the securities selected for the fund, in the aggregate, will not provide investment performance matching that of the index. Index sampling risk for the fund should be low.

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund’s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


The 7-day SEC yield reflects fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements in effect for the period. Had the Adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses, the 7-day SEC yield would have been lower.


Average annual total returns reflect reinvested distributions, net of expenses for the periods. The 7-day SEC yield more closely reflects the current earning of the fund than the total returns.

Performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than that shown here.


Northern Trust Investments, Inc. has contractually agreed to reimburse a portion of the operating expenses of the Portfolio (other than certain excepted expenses, i.e., acquired fund fees and expenses, service fees, the compensation paid to each Independent Trustee of the Trust, expenses of third party consultants engaged by the Board of Trustees, membership dues paid to the Investment Company Institute and Mutual Fund Directors Forum, expenses in connection with the negotiation and renewal of the revolving credit facility, extraordinary expenses and interest) to the extent the "Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses" exceed 0.25%. This contractual limitation may not be terminated before April 1, 2018 without the approval of the Board of Trustees. In the absence of these reimbursements, yield, total return, growth since inception and dividends would have been reduced. Total return is based on net change in NAV assuming reinvestment of distributions. The 7-day current yield more closely reflects the current earnings of the Portfolio than the total returns. The Portfolio also includes voluntary expense reimbursements to prevent a negative yield that may change or end at any time. Without the voluntary expense reimbursements, the 7-day current yield would have been 0.78% for Shares and 0.78% for Service Shares as of June 30, 2017. In the event the 7-day current yield with waivers and the 7-day current yield without waivers are equal, it would indicate there were no voluntary waivers necessary for the preceding 7-day period.


NAV Information: Market Value NAV is calculated using current market quotations, or an appropriate substitute, to value a portfolio. This NAV is not currently being used for transacting purchase and sale activity. All purchase and sale activity is being transacted at the Amortized Cost NAV of $1.00.

‡Includes contractual expense reimbursements that, if not extended, will end on April 1, 2018. Effective July 1, 2016, Northern Trust Investments, Inc. has contractually agreed to reimburse a portion of the operating expenses of the U.S. Government Portfolio to the extent that the Portfolio's "Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses" exceed 0.25%.

Credit ratings are subject to change. AAAm rating by Standard & Poor's is obtained after Standard & Poor's evaluates a number of factors, including credit quality, market price, exposure and management. Money market funds rated Aaa-mf by Moody’s are judged to have a very strong ability to meet the dual objectives of providing liquidity and preserving capital. Ratings are based on an evaluation of several factors including: objective measures to assess portfolio credit quality as well as market and liquidity risks in stress scenarios, sponsor quality, the fund’s management, and legal factors. This fund is on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners list. Inclusion on the NAIC list is the result of an accounting measure involving the fund’s underlying investments, and does not constitute an assessment of quality. The NAIC listing does not represent an endorsement or recommendation of the overall fund.
For more information about the ratings provided by Moody's and Standard and Poor's, please visit their websites at www.moodys.com and www.standardandpoors.com, respectively.

All data is as of date indicated and subject to change.












U.S. Government Guarantee: U.S. government guarantees apply only to the underlying securities of a Fund’s portfolio and not the Fund’s shares.





iMoneyNet Fund AverageTM - Government/Agencies Institutional category includes the most broadly based of the government institutional funds. These funds may invest in U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agencies, repos or government-backed floating rate notes. The category average is the average of all funds in this category reported by iMoneyNet. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.





Quality Distribution: A security is classified as Tier 1 when two or more of the three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies have assigned a rating in their top short-term ratings category (A1+ and A1 for Standard & Poor's, P1 for Moody's and F1+ and F1 for Fitch). A security is classified as Tier 2 when two or more of the ratings assigned to that security are below the top short-term ratings from the agencies (this would include ratings of A2 for Standard & Poor's, P2 for Moody's and F2 for Fitch). If a security has only two short-term ratings available, the lower rating is used to define the Tier; i.e. a split rating of A1/P2 is considered Tier 2. If only one short-term rating is available for a security, the Tier is determined by that one agency. A security is classified as Tier 3 if it does not meet the definition of Tier 1 or Tier 2, has two or more ratings below A2, P2, or F2 or if the security does not have a short-term rating.





Distribution Calculations: (Security Distribution, Quality Distribution, Maturity Distribution and Sector Distribution) are measured on a trade date basis and exclude uninvested cash from the market value used to compute the percentage calculations.





Maturity Distribution: The data is measured using the lower of the stated maturity date or next interest rate reset date.

                Lowering Interest Rate Risk 
Without Sacrificing Yield
            

SHAG: WisdomTree Barclays Yield Enhanced U.S. Short-Term Aggregate Bond Fund
In today’s fixed income markets, the ability for investors to maintain the appropriate balance between risk and return remains extremely challenging.  In many instances, decreasing interest rate risk means a significant reduction in yield. While this may be conventional wisdom, there are alternatives to that line of thinking.
The WisdomTree Barclays Yield Enhanced U.S. Short-Term Aggregate Bond Fund (SHAG) offers investors:

The potential to lower interest rate risk while simultaneously enhancing income.
An approach for minimizing interest rate risk  in the core  of their portfolio without having to sacrifice yield.
A cost-efficient alternative to traditional short-term, income exposure.
