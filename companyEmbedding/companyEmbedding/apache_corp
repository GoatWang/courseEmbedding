Careers






Home>CareersA few terms define Apache’s culture: grow, succeed, innovate – and do it faster than the competition.
Since our founding in 1954, we’ve grown through the determination and efforts of our people, in spite of the obstacles in our path. In fact, some of Apache’s greatest steps forward came during times of greatest adversity in the oil and gas industry. To continue this pattern of growth and success, we hire the best people in the exploration and production business; we encourage them to take risks; and we retain them through challenging and rewarding work.
If you are ready for such challenges, Apache could be the place for you.

Integrity, respect, individual initiative, innovation and striving for excellence.
These are core values that define Apache Corporation, and they're the values we expect from our suppliers.  Each of our suppliers are expected to maintain the highest level of safety and environmental stewardship and to comply with our corporate code of business conduct.
If you're a supplier who would like to do business with Apache, please contact your local Apache representative to inform them of the type of work you can provide. If your services are needed, they will provide you with a Vendor Addition Request Form. 
While we cannot conduct business with every company, we reevaluate our supplier base as the need arises. We are committed to a selection process that provides all suppliers with an equal opportunity to submit information about their organizations, products and services for consideration.

In 1967, the oil well Fagerness #1 was drilled, yielding the company's first major discovery.[3]
In 1969, Apache Corporation became a public company via an initial public offering and its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: APA).[3]
In 1970, Apache diversified into agriculture with the acquisition of the S&J Ranch in California. The ranch produced citrus fruit, figs, pistachios, olives, and almonds.[4]
In 1971, it formed Apache Exploration Company (subsequently "Apexco") as its oil and gas operating company.[3]

Pipeline explosion[edit]
In 2008, the natural gas pipeline explosion at Apache's Varanus Island processing hub on 3 June 2008 led to the 2008 Western Australian gas crisis. Apache restored 60% of Varanus Island gas deliveries on August 8, 2008.[39] The Australian government was forced to drop charges as a result of a technicality.[40]
Attempts to limit shareholder proposals[edit]

In 2012, Apache purchased assets in the Beryl field in the North Sea from ExxonMobil.[33]
In 2012, Apache completed the acquisition of Cordillera Energy Partners in a deal worth $2.5 billion in cash and 6.3 million shares of common stock. The acquisition added approximately 71 million barrels of oil equivalent (430,000,000 GJ) to Apache's reserves and strengthened its position across western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.[34]
In November 2013, Apache completed the sale of a non-controlling 1/3 share of its Egyptian assets to Sinopec [35]
In 2015, the company sold its assets in Western Australia for $2.1 billion.[36]
Controversies[edit]
2013 toxic waste spill[edit]
On June 1, 2013 an Apache pipeline in northern Alberta, Canada was noticed to have ruptured, spilling 60,000 barrels (9.5 million litres) of toxic waste in what was cited as one of the largest of such disasters in recent history in North America.[37][38]
Pipeline explosion[edit]
In 2008, the natural gas pipeline explosion at Apache's Varanus Island processing hub on 3 June 2008 led to the 2008 Western Australian gas crisis. Apache restored 60% of Varanus Island gas deliveries on August 8, 2008.[39] The Australian government was forced to drop charges as a result of a technicality.[40]
Attempts to limit shareholder proposals[edit]
In 2007, Apache CEO G. Steven Farris wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission in favor of limits on nonbinding shareholder proposals at public company annual meetings.[41]

History[edit]
In 1954, the Apache Oil Corporation was founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, by Truman Anderson, Raymond Plank and Charles Arnao with $250,000 in funding.[3]
In 1955, the first wells were drilled in the Cushing field, between Tulsa and Oklahoma City.[3]
In 1960, Apache acquired interests in the Foshay Tower, a Minneapolis landmark. The 32-story imitation of the Washington Monument, became Apache's headquarters from the early 1960s until 1984.[3]
In 1967, the oil well Fagerness #1 was drilled, yielding the company's first major discovery.[3]
In 1969, Apache Corporation became a public company via an initial public offering and its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: APA).[3]
In 1970, Apache diversified into agriculture with the acquisition of the S&J Ranch in California. The ranch produced citrus fruit, figs, pistachios, olives, and almonds.[4]
In 1971, it formed Apache Exploration Company (subsequently "Apexco") as its oil and gas operating company.[3]
In 1977, the company sold Apexco and its non-petroleum holdings, including the ranch, and reinvested into a farm-in agreement with GHK to operate its wells in the Anadarko Basin.[3]
In 1980, the company acquired a non-operating interest, via a participation in a Royal Dutch Shell joint venture, in operations in the Gulf Of Mexico.[5]
In 1981, the company created Apache Petroleum Company (APC), the first public master limited partnership in the United States.[5][6]
In 1985, the company acquired oil and gas wells in 8 states from David Holdings for $200 million. In 1986, the company acquired oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico from Occidental Petroleum.[5][7]

In 1993, Apache acquired Hadson Energy Resources in a $58 million transaction, expanding its assets to offshore Western Australia.[8][12]
In 1994, the company entered Egypt by acquiring a 25 percent non-operated interest in the Qarun Concession, operated by the Phoenix Resource Companies.[8] Production began in December 1995.[13]
In 1995, the company acquired Dekalb Energy Canada, marking Apache's return to Canada, in a $285 million stock transaction.[8][14]

In 1996, Apache acquired Phoenix Resources and took over operations of the Qarun Concession in Egypt.[16]
In 1999, the company acquired fields and leases in the Gulf of Mexico from Royal Dutch Shell for $715 million in cash, plus 1 million shares of stock.[17]
In 2001, Apache acquired operations in the Western Desert of Egypt from Repsol YPF for $410 million.[18]
In 2002, Apache Corporation drilled its first deepwater wells in the West Mediterranean Concession of offshore Egypt.[19]

In 2003, Apache acquired the Forties oilfield, the largest field ever discovered in the United Kingdom North Sea as well as assets in the Gulf of Mexico from BP for $1.3 billion.[21]
In 2005, Apache and ExxonMobil completed a series of agreements that provided for transfers and joint ventures across a broad range of properties in Western Canada.[22]
Later in 2005, the company partially sold its stake in the deepwater section of Egypt's concession.[23]
In 2006, Apache completed the sale of its oil production interest in China to Australia-based ROC Oil Company Limited for US$260 million.[24]
In 2006, Apache bought many Gulf of Mexico Shelf properties from BP.[25]
In 2007, A test horizontal well at the Van Gogh project, in Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, produced 9,694 barrels per day.[26]
In 2010, Apache started production from the Van Gogh development offshore Western Australia.[27]
In 2010, a Federal judge upheld Apache's decision to exclude from its annual meeting ballot a corporate governance proposal from a person who had not proven on a timely basis that he actually was one of the company's shareholders.[28]
In 2010, Apache acquired Mariner Energy for $2.7 billion.[29]

In 1955, the first wells were drilled in the Cushing field, between Tulsa and Oklahoma City.[3]
In 1960, Apache acquired interests in the Foshay Tower, a Minneapolis landmark. The 32-story imitation of the Washington Monument, became Apache's headquarters from the early 1960s until 1984.[3]
In 1967, the oil well Fagerness #1 was drilled, yielding the company's first major discovery.[3]
In 1969, Apache Corporation became a public company via an initial public offering and its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: APA).[3]
In 1970, Apache diversified into agriculture with the acquisition of the S&J Ranch in California. The ranch produced citrus fruit, figs, pistachios, olives, and almonds.[4]
In 1971, it formed Apache Exploration Company (subsequently "Apexco") as its oil and gas operating company.[3]
In 1977, the company sold Apexco and its non-petroleum holdings, including the ranch, and reinvested into a farm-in agreement with GHK to operate its wells in the Anadarko Basin.[3]
In 1980, the company acquired a non-operating interest, via a participation in a Royal Dutch Shell joint venture, in operations in the Gulf Of Mexico.[5]

In 2005, Apache and ExxonMobil completed a series of agreements that provided for transfers and joint ventures across a broad range of properties in Western Canada.[22]
Later in 2005, the company partially sold its stake in the deepwater section of Egypt's concession.[23]

2013 toxic waste spill[edit]
On June 1, 2013 an Apache pipeline in northern Alberta, Canada was noticed to have ruptured, spilling 60,000 barrels (9.5 million litres) of toxic waste in what was cited as one of the largest of such disasters in recent history in North America.[37][38]
Pipeline explosion[edit]
In 2008, the natural gas pipeline explosion at Apache's Varanus Island processing hub on 3 June 2008 led to the 2008 Western Australian gas crisis. Apache restored 60% of Varanus Island gas deliveries on August 8, 2008.[39] The Australian government was forced to drop charges as a result of a technicality.[40]
Attempts to limit shareholder proposals[edit]
In 2007, Apache CEO G. Steven Farris wrote to the Securities and Exchange Commission in favor of limits on nonbinding shareholder proposals at public company annual meetings.[41]

Apache Oil of Pasadena Texas has been providing HPP Corp. with diesel fuel, lubricants and various other supplies for our fleet of heavy equipment for the past 7 years. The service provided by their staff has been “Outstanding”. Our Account Manager, Jay Britt, has provided Excellent Service. Johnny in dispatch and the inside sales staff are always quick to provide Top Notch Service. The warehouse crew is always ready to help me load up supplies. Apache’s pricing is competitive and invoicing accurate. I wish all my vendors were as efficient and easy to do business with.

For those not familiar with an Ironman competition, that’s a 2.4 mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon, or 26.22 miles, raced in that order and without a break.  Snapp, marketing representative in Apache’s U.S. Gas Marketing group, moved to the gas marketing desk in January 2015 after working his way t...hrough the marketing organization’s rotation program.  The U.S. Gas Marketing group sells all of Apache’s U.S. residue gas production. It’s a 24/7 business with multiple daily deadlines and is operating at a time when exports to Mexico and the LNG business are taking domestic production beyond U.S. borders.        Snapp is able to apply the lessons he draws from triathlons to the workplace. Motivation on the job is important, he says, as is self-improvement, especially in a crowded, competitive industry. And he better understands the imperative to be prudent with time, budget and energy. The finish earned Snapp his Ironman pro card and qualified him for the World Championship in Kona, Hawaii, in October.  Congratulations Ryan, and Good Luck! 展开Apache Corporation 上传了 2 张新照片。 · 7月4日 12:55 · Every day at Apache, we are humbled and inspired to work with colleagues, organizations and communities who exemplify the best of America.

They also have the opportunity to interact with the families being housed there temporarily, enabling them to hear their stories and learn their background while enjoying dinner.Apache Corporation · 6月19日 · If not for a change of heart, Tad Smith might have been a professional violinist. But Apache’s director of geoscience for the Exploration and Production Technology department had second thoughts in college that led him to a Ph.D. in geology  from Texas A&M and ultimately to one of the most influential jobs at Apache. Smith was recently named to the Texas A&M geology and geophysics department advisory council, an honor that underscores his contribution to Apache and to the oil... industry more broadly. The advisory group of 25 meets twice a year in College Station, Texas, addressing everything from curriculum to fundraising to alumnae relations. The appointment comes at a critical time for oil companies, given their increased reliance on universities like Texas A&M to provide them with future leaders to navigate an increasingly complex energy landscape. The good news:  A&M’s geology and geophysics department has seen an 80-percent increase in undergraduate students in the past two years.  “It’s in the industry’s best interest to make sure our feeder schools have the resources and guidance they need to prepare students for a career in earth sciences,” said Smith. “We need people who are passionate about this field, people willing to speak up, people who can make a difference.” 展开Apache Corporation · 6月14日 · A few weeks ago, Fund for Teachers held their annual Sporting Clay Shoot at Jake’s Clays in Midland, Texas, an event Apache was proud to support.

Max Easley, director of Permian Operations, was on hand to draw the raffle winners. One in eight participants won a prize.  About F...und for Teachers Fund for Teachers supports educators' efforts to develop skills, knowledge and confidence that impact student achievement. By trusting teachers to design unique fellowships, Fund for Teachers grants validate teachers' professionalism and leadership, as well. Since 2001, Fund for Teachers has invested $27.5 million in nearly 7,500 teachers, transforming grants into growth for teachers and their students. 展开Apache Corporation · 6月8日 · Just as we strive for excellent in all we do, Apache will often bring in guest speakers who are excellent in their own walk of life.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
