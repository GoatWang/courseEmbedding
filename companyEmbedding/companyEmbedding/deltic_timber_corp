Potlatch downgraded after disappointing timber tariff news, valuation concerns
Shares of Potlatch Corp.  dropped 1.7% in morning trade Tuesday, after the real estate investment trust which owns timberlands was downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation in the wake of underwhelming regulatory announcement regarding tariffs on Canadian lumber. Analyst Colin Mings cut his rating to market perform from outperform and removed his stock price target. The stock closed Monday at a four-year high of $48.20, above Mings' previous price target of $48. Late Monday, the Commerce Department announced it was considering additional fees on Canadian lumber imports that would mean some products could face duties as high as 30.88%. The announcement comes two months after the Trump administration moved to impose a 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Mings said that while protectionist trade policies are a positive for the timber REIT sector, the preliminary duty rates were within expectations. "However, there was no upside surprise in yesterday's announcement relative to our forecast, and we believe the preliminary finding will underwhelm some investors expecting a more aggressive stance on the issue," Mings wrote in a note to clients. July lumber futures  tumbled 1.8%. Among other timber REITs, shares of CatchMark Timber Trust Inc.  slipped 0.3%, Deltic Timber Corp.  lost 0.7% and Rayonier Inc.  edged up 0.1%. Potlatch's stock has climbed 14% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Potlatch downgraded after disappointing timber tariff news, valuation concerns
Shares of Potlatch Corp.  dropped 1.7% in morning trade Tuesday, after the real estate investment trust which owns timberlands was downgraded at Raymond James, which cited valuation in the wake of underwhelming regulatory announcement regarding tariffs on Canadian lumber. Analyst Colin Mings cut his rating to market perform from outperform and removed his stock price target. The stock closed Monday at a four-year high of $48.20, above Mings' previous price target of $48. Late Monday, the Commerce Department announced it was considering additional fees on Canadian lumber imports that would mean some products could face duties as high as 30.88%. The announcement comes two months after the Trump administration moved to impose a 20% tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber. Mings said that while protectionist trade policies are a positive for the timber REIT sector, the preliminary duty rates were within expectations. "However, there was no upside surprise in yesterday's announcement relative to our forecast, and we believe the preliminary finding will underwhelm some investors expecting a more aggressive stance on the issue," Mings wrote in a note to clients. July lumber futures  tumbled 1.8%. Among other timber REITs, shares of CatchMark Timber Trust Inc.  slipped 0.3%, Deltic Timber Corp.  lost 0.7% and Rayonier Inc.  edged up 0.1%. Potlatch's stock has climbed 14% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

May 3 17
Deltic Timber Corporation reported preliminary and unaudited and consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net sales of $53,215,000 compared to $50,624,000 a year ago. Net income was $1,081,000 compared to $395,000 a year ago. Basic and diluted EPS were $0.09 compared to $0.03 a year ago. The improved financial results for the first quarter of 2017 were primarily due to increased operating income in the company’s Manufacturing segment resulting from a higher average sales price for both lumber and medium density fiberboard, increased lumber sales volume, and improved operating performance at the company’s MDF plant. Capital expenditures were $7.8 million in the first quarter 2017 compared to $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2016. Income before income taxes was $2,541,000 against $574,000 a year ago. Operating income was $3,997,000 against $3,217,000 a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,334,000 against $2,780,000 a year ago. First quarter results benefited from a solid uptick in lumber pricing, a positive trend driven by steady improvement in lumber demand as well as the implementation of tariffs on Canadian lumber imports. 


For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects pine sawtimber harvest to be 200,000 to 230,000 tons. Finished lumber sales volume is estimated to be 70 to 80 million board feet for the second quarter of 2017. MDF sales volume for the second quarter is forecast to be 20 to 30 million square feet.


For the full year 2017, the company expects pine sawtimber harvest to be 765,000 to 790,000 tons. Finished lumber sales volume is estimated to be 290 to 315 million board feet for the full year 2017. MDF sales volume for the year is forecast to be 90 to 115 million square feet. The company anticipates CapEx in 2017 to be approximately $34 million.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
