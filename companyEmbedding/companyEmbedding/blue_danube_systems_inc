Blue Danube Systems Announces FDD LTE Massive MIMO Commercial Trials with Shenandoah Telecommunications Company and AT&T
Feb 16 17
Blue Danube Systems announced that it has completed first commercial trials of its Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in licensed FDD (Frequency Division Duplex) LTE spectrum. These trials were conducted using company’s BeamCraft™ 500 active antenna product for advanced 3D beamforming, which is capable of delivering a 160W of transmit power for a Massive MIMO system. Based on its underlying High Definition Active Antenna System (HDAAS™) technology, the 96 element BeamCraft 500 can intelligently and seamlessly focus signal energy where it is needed, allowing wireless carriers to better serve high demand areas and minimize interference zones. These trials were conducted with Shenandoah Telecommunications Company (Shentel) and AT&T, supported over 10TB of data during a three-month period. Through a simple retrofit of the existing antenna with a BeamCraft 500 unit at the trial sites, an improvement of 2X to 5X in throughput was demonstrated for users in high traffic demand areas for the same transmit power as the legacy installation. Additionally, users received up to 20X improvement in instantaneous video throughput and experienced smooth 1080p HD videos in locations where existing systems were stalling and previously only capable of 144p. A second phase of trials is now ongoing to test additional operational modes and traffic scenarios.

      Shentel MIMO Trial Yields Up to 5x Wireless Bandwidth Boost      

 Joan Engebretson
February 19, 2017
A new technology known as massive MIMO has the potential to help urban and rural wireless carriers substantially improve the performance of current mobile infrastructure through an antenna change.
In a recent Shentel MIMO trial in Woodstock, Va, the regional wireless carrier saw massive MIMO technology yield bandwidth gains of up to 20 times for video traffic and up to five times for traffic overall without increasing power requirements, according to Blue Danube Systems, the massive MIMO developer whose technology was used in the trials. AT&T is an investor in Blue Danube Systems and also participated in a similar trial in St. Paul, Minn. Read More

Blue Danube Selects MaxLinear Clock Jitter Cleaner Product for Massive MIMO Wireless Systems
Posted By  MaxLinear on February 27, 2017 


MaxLinear’s new PM7531 provides ultra-low jitter clock that enhances system performance for BeamCraft™ product

BARCELONA – Feb. 27, 2017 – MaxLinear Inc. (NYSE: MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF) and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home and wired and wireless infrastructure markets, today announced that Blue Danube has selected its PM7531 as the high-accuracy clock generator in its next-generation massive MIMO product, BeamCraft™.
Blue Danube’s BeamCraft™ products generate agile 3D beams for unparalleled accuracy in spectrum power placement to improve capacity for 4G/5G networks. BeamCraft systems can be easily mounted onto existing antenna locations on towers and buildings and support both AWS and PCS frequency bands. Recently, Blue Danube concluded commercial trials of the industry’s first FDD massive MIMO system.
The PM7531 is an ultra-low power clock synthesizer with an integrated jitter attenuator that delivers the industry’s lowest output phase noise of -165dBc/Hz for a 122.88MHz carrier frequency measured at 800kHz offset. Operating at less than 700mW, the PM7531 integrates high-performance phase-lock loops (PLLs) and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) to generate and condition the precision system clocks and reference signals used inside wireless base station radio modules.
PM7531 features include multiple reference inputs, reference switching, short-term holdover, and JESD SYSREF generation, with programmable dividers and delay for each of 18 outputs. Its ultra-low output jitter enhances radio system performance for next-generation 4G/5G macrocell base stations, active antenna systems (AAS), small cells, software-defined radios (SDR), digital broadcast, wired communications, test and measurement, and medical imaging applications.
“MaxLinear’s clock product family has been very well received by major telecom customers because of its high level of integration, unmatched phase noise performance, and lowest power consumption – all of which are required to power best-in-class wireless infrastructure radios,” said Brendan Walsh, Vice President of Marketing, Wireless Infrastructure Group. “We’re pleased to enable the high-performance architecture of Blue Danube’s BeamCraft™ products.”
“MaxLinear’s PM7531 provides the ultra-low jitter clock and proven performance we need to quickly integrate and commercialize our active antenna products with existing infrastructure solutions,” said Mihai Banu, CTO of Blue Danube Systems.
The PM7531 is available in volume quantities. For more information email: info@maxlinear.com.

      Blue Danube Systems Raises $16 Million in Series B Funding
    



Includes a strategic investment from AT&T to accelerate deployment






May 12, 2015 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blue 
      Danube Systems, a provider of mobile wireless access solutions that 
      significantly and cost-effectively increase network capacity and enhance 
      quality of service, today announced that it closed $16 million in Series 
      B funding. Previous investor Sequoia 
      Capital and new investor Northgate 
      participated in the round, which also includes a strategic investment by AT&T 
      that will help accelerate early product testing and deployment. To date, 
      Blue Danube has raised a total of $23.7 million in equity financing.
    


      Blue Danube is addressing the explosive growth of mobile data generated 
      from the proliferation of video apps and interconnected devices by 
      making more efficient use of the existing wireless spectrum. The company 
      will use these new funds to accelerate the commercial deployment of a 
      novel radio system, based on its proprietary integrated circuits and 
      software, which enables up to a 10X increase in average cell capacity 
      with existing LTE infrastructure and mobile devices. The technology also 
      empowers mobile service providers to shape capacity to better serve 
      high-demand service areas and mitigate interference zones.
    

      “We have made remarkable progress in delivering first working systems 
      and validating the disruptive potential of our technology,” said Dr. 
      Mark Pinto, CEO of Blue Danube. “With this level of support from 
      investors, we are confident we will deliver commercial products that 
      provide a 5G experience on today’s 4G networks.”
