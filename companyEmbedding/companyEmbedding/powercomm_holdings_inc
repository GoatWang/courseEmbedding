The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling 
Shareholder Shares.


The Company specializes in providing services related to overhead and 
underground electrical transmission distribution, construction and maintenance.
Since the Company’s services are highly specialized, there are no other firms in
the industry that offer the specific set of services offered by the Company. As
a result, the Company has a favorable competitive position in the market as the
only supplier of its distinctly specialized services and does not anticipate
encountering any significant competition in the near future.


Company Description
The Company is an early-stage company whose current business is in electric
utility, fiber optic, and telecommunications construction and maintenance
services. The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 12,
2015, and was formerly known as White Grotto Acquisition Corporation


 (“White
Grotto” or “White Grotto Acquisition”). 

On September 14, 2015, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing
shares to new shareholders, redeeming shares of existing shareholders, electing
new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing
officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the
shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company’s name from White Grotto Acquisition Corporation to
PowerComm Holdings, Inc. 

On November 15, 2016, the Company entered into a stock-for-stock acquisition 
agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with PowerComm Construction, Inc., a
private company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia
(“PCC”). 
---

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary PCC, installs, connects and
services the energy and communications sectors. Experienced PCC teams also build
and maintain America’s infrastructure from fiber-optic lines to high voltage
lines to cellular communication towers. The current business of PCC is in
electric utility, fiber optic, and telecommunications construction and
maintenance services. PCC has provided for almost 20 years a diverse range of
power services, telecommunications and fiber optic services and cellular
services. PCC is a longstanding service provider that works on complex projects
for industry leaders. PCC service crews perform electrical power line work on
overhead and underground power distribution infrastructures as well as on
transmission and sub-transmission lines.

The Company is located at 3429 Ramsgate Terrace, Alexandria, Virginia 22309. The
Company’s main phone number is (571) 259-8773. The Company's email address is

                          Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

NATURE OF OPERATIONS

PowerComm Holdings Inc. (formerly White Grotto Acquisition Corporation)
(PowerComm or the Company) was incorporated on January 12, 2015 under the
laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking,
including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.

On September 14,2015, the Company effected a change in control by the
redemption of 19,500,000 shares of then outstanding 20,000,000 shares
of common stock. The current officers and directors resigned and David
Kwasnik was named the sole officer and director of the company.  Pursuant
to the change in control, the company changed its name to PowerComnm
Holdings Inc. On September 15, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 shares
of common stock to David Kwasnik.

The Company intends to develop through a business combination with an
ongoing company otherwise a company designed to serve as a holding company
for certain privately owned power transmission, distribution,
telecommunications, fiber optic, cellular communications, excavation,
dredging, gas and oil pipeline, road and bridge, wind and solar,
alternative energy, bio-fuels, and bio-coal construction companies.

The Company has been in the developmental stage since inception.

The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of the target company with the Company. The combination
will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or
stock-for-assets exchange.

In most instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of tax-free reorganization under
Section 351 or section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful
in locating or negotiating with any target company.  The Company has been
formed to provide a method for a foreign domestic private company to
become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited financial
statements. Such unaudited financial statements and accompanying
notes are the representations of the Company's management, who are
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting
policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP) in all material respects, and have
been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited
financial statements.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) were
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The results for the three
months ended June 30,2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of unaudited financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at
banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not have
cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The
Company places its cash with high quality banking institutions.
The Company did not have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation limit as of June 30, 2016.

POWERCOMM HOLDINGS
            Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements


INCOME TAXES

Under ASC 740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances
are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.  As of June 30, 2016 there
were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of
net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration.

LOSS PER COMMON SHARE

Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by
dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock was exercised or converted into common
stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared
in the loss of the entity. As of June 30, 2016, there are no outstanding
dilutive securities.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the unaudited financial statements on a recurring
basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value
measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and
disclosed at fair value in the unaudited financial statements
on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to
measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3
measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as
follows:

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
directly or indirectly.

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN

The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception to
date and has sustained an operating loss of $3,000 from January 1,
2016 to June 30, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit
of $9,500 and an accumulated deficit of $10,558 as of June 30, 2016.
The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its
ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet
its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members
or other sources, as may be required.




______________________________________________________________________

                 POWERCOMM HOLDINGS INC.
            Notes to Unaudited Financial Statements

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however,
the above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability
to do so. The unaudited financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of
liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue
as a going concern.

In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company
will require additional working capital from either cash flow from
operations or from the sale of its equity.  However, the Company
currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase
of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional working
capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its current level
of operations.


NOTE 3 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity
in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative). The objective
of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve
areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost
and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the
usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements.
Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax
liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a
classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation
of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that
deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a
classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this
Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities
and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented
as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update.
For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective
for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning
of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is still in the
process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

On June 12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical
Corrections and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a
wide range of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements to the
Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on
current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost
to most entities. This Accounting Standards Update is the final
version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-240-Technical
Corrections and Improvements, which has been deleted.
Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this Update. The
amendments in this Update that require transition guidance are
effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. All other
amendments will be effective upon the issuance of this Update.
Management is in the process of assessing the impact of this ASU
on the Company's financial statements.

On April 30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06 Earnings per
Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per units of Master
Limited Partnership Dropdown Transaction.  Under Topic 260, Earnings
per Share, Master Limited partnerships (MPLS) apply the two class method
to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the general partner,
limited partners, and incentive distribution rights holders each
participate differently on the distribution of available cash. When
a general partner transfers or (drops down) net assets to a master
limited partnership and that the transaction is accounted for as a
transaction between entities under common control, the statement of
operations of the master limited partnership are adjusted
retrospectively to reflect the dropdown transaction as it occurred
on the earliest date during which the entities were under common
control. The amendments in this update specify that for the purpose of
calculating historical EPU under the two-class method, the earning
(losses) of a transferred business before the late dropdown transaction
should be allocated entirely to the general partner interest, and
previously reported EPU of the limited partners would not change as
a result of a dropdown transaction.  Qualitative disclosure about
how the rights to earnings (losses) differ before and after the
dropdown transaction occurs also are required. This Accounting
Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards
Update EITF-14A Earnings Per Share Effects on Historical Earnings per
Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions (Topic 260),
which has been deleted. Effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Earlier application is permitted. The amendments in
this Update should be applied retrospectively for all financial
statements presented. Management is in the process of assessing the
impact of this ASU on the Company's financial statements.


Note 4   ACCRUED EXPENSE

As of June 30, 2016, the Company had an accrued professional expense
of $9,500.


NOTE 5   STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT

On January 22, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 founders common stock
to two directors and officers. On September 14, 2015, the Company
redeemed 19,500,000 of then outstanding 20,000,000 shares at a redemption
price of $.0001 per share for an aggregate redemption price of $1,950.

On September 15, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 shares of its common
stock pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 at par, to
David Kwasnik as a party of the change in control of the Company.

The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 Shares of common stock and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock.  As of June 30, 2016 20,500,000
shares of common stock and no preferred stock were issued and outstanding.

NOTE 6  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

Management has evaluated subsequent events through October 5, 2016,
the date which the financial statements were available to be issued.
All subsequent events requiring recognition as of June 30, 2016 have been
incorporated into these financial statements and there are no subsequent
events that require disclosure in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 855,
Subsequent Events.







______________________________________________________________________


ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
          CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

PowerComm Holdings Inc. was incorporated on January 12, 2015 under the laws
of the State of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking,
including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.

PowerComm Holdings Inc. (PowerComm or the Company) is a blank check
company and qualifies as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April, 2012.

Since inception the Company operations to date of the period covered
by this report have been limited to issuing shares of common stock to its
original shareholders and filing a registration statement on Form 10 on
March 2, 2015 with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended to register its class of common
Stock and effecting a change of control.

On September 14, 2015, the following events occurred in the change of control:

The Company redeemed an aggregate of 19,500,000 of the then 20,000,000 shares
of outstanding stock at a redemption price of $0.0001 per share for an
aggregate redemption price of $ 1,950.

James Cassidy and James McKillop, the then current officers and directors
resigned.

David Kwasnik was named the sole director and officer of the Company.

On September 15, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000 shares of its common
stock to David Kwasnik.

The Company filed a Form 8-K noticing the change of control.



The Company has no operations nor does it currently engage in any
business activities generating revenues. The Company intends to develop
through a business combination with an ongoing company otherwise a company
designed to serve as a holding company for certain privately owned power
transmission, distribution, telecommunications, fiber optic, cellular
communications, excavation, dredging, gas and oil pipeline, road and
bridge, wind and solar, alternative energy, bio-fuels, and bio-coal
construction companies.

A combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange.  In most instances the target
company will wish to structure the business combination to be within the
definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, the
Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization,
joint venture, licensing agreement or other arrangement with another
corporation or entity.  On the consummation of a transaction, it is likely
that the present management and shareholders of the Company will no longer
be in control of the Company.  In addition, it is likely that the officer
and director of the Company will, as part of the terms of the business
combination, resign and be replaced by one or more new officers and
directors.

As of June 30, 2016 the Company had not generated revenues and had
no income or cash flows from operations since inception.  For the six
months ended June 30 2016 the Company had sustained a net loss of $3,000,
and had an accumulated deficit of $10,558 as of June 30, 2016.

At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of
Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its
stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to
continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with
a business entity for the combination of that target company with
PowerComm Holdings Inc.


ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Information not required to be filed by Smaller reporting companies.


ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures.

Disclosures and Procedures

Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to
Exchange Act Rules.  This evaluation was done as of the end of the
period covered by this report under the supervision and with the
participation of the Company's principal executive officer (who is
also the principal financial officer).

Based upon that evaluation, he believes that the Company's
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in gathering, analyzing
and disclosing information needed to ensure that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and
communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

This Quarterly Report does not include an attestation report of

Website Rebuilt & Redesigned

Early in 2011 we realized that in order to bring our customers an online experience worthy of clicks, registrations and return visits, and have a platform for innovation over the long term, the site needed to be rebuilt from the ground up. The result is a new front-end interface and back-end architecture designed to make our site easier for users to navigate and update.

                        We're proud of what we built, but the process has also brought the site "back to beta" as a work in progress. We have a long queue of updates and features that are in the works as much more content and functionality will be needed to realize our vision of providing our current and future customers with an abundance of high quality content and become the most comprehensive online resource for Power Line Carrier professionals.

                        We'd love hearing your thoughts on the site's new layout and any bugs you might spot. If you have a brilliant idea for new content or a feature, let us know so our development team can prioritize their next projects.

PCC
cellular services span a range of tower services and maintenance.
For tower services, PCC offers construction (such as tower

Legal
Matters

 

At the

unlimited legal fees in defense of the suit.

during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $3,063,319 as compared

loss of $143,573 as compared to a net loss of $302,306 for the year

loss of $212,943 as compared to net income of $75,547 for the six

respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

EXPRESSED IN THE ACT AND IS, THEREFORE,
UNENFORCEABLE.

NOTES TO
UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 




 



1.



NATURE OF
OPERATIONS




 

PowerComm
Construction, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in
Massachusetts in 1997 and has been headquartered in Alexandria,
Virginia, since 2000. On September 26, 2014, the Company changed
its state of incorporation to Virginia. The Company performs
underground and overhead utility services primarily in the
southeastern region of the United States working solely with
utility companies. The Company’s fiscal year ends on December
31.

 




 



2.



SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




 

Basis of
presentation:

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared pursuant to
the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) and in accordance with the U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

 

Use of
estimates and assumptions:

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Management makes these estimates using the
best information available at the time the estimates are made.
However, actual results could differ materially from those results.
The most significant estimates reflected in the financial
statements include depreciation and useful lives of property and
equipment. Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and
the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements
in the period they are determined to be necessary.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents:

 

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash and all highly liquid instruments
with original maturities of three months or less.

 

Accounts
receivable:

 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at net realizable value consisting of the
carrying amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts, as needed.
Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and
analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer
credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. Based
on the management’s assessment, no allowance for doubtful
accounts was recorded at the balance sheet dates.

 

Fixed
assets:

 

Fixed
assets consist of computers, furniture and fixtures, machinery and
equipment, and trucks and vehicles. They are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals and
betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are
retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain
or loss is included in operations.

POWERCOMM

NOTES TO
UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Depreciation
is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

 




 



Useful
Life (in years)





 



 





Computers



5





Office
Furniture and Fixtures



7





Machinery
and Equipment

Trucks and
Vehicles

The
Company applies the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 360 (ASC 360),
“Property, Plant, and Equipment” which addresses
financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in
accordance with ASC 360, at least on an annual basis. ASC 360
requires the impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets
used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those
assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that
event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the
carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived
assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined
in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for
the cost of disposal. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and
the year ended December 31, 2015, there was no impairment of
long-lived assets recorded.

 

Revenue
recognition:

 

The
Company performs underground and overhead utility services
primarily in the southeastern region of the United States for
utility companies. The Company’s work is performed under
cost-plus-fee contracts. The length of the Company’s
contracts varies, but are typically two to three years. Revenues
are recognized on the accrual basis as services are performed. The
Company recognizes service revenue in accordance with GAAP when the
following overall fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or
the service has been performed, (iii) the Company’s price to
the customer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection of the
resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured. During the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015,
the Company recognized revenue when the above four criteria were
met.

 

Cost of
revenue:

 

Costs of
revenue include all direct materials, labor costs, equipment and
those indirect costs, including depreciation of machinery and
equipment, trucks and vehicles, and indirect labor, supplies,
tools, repairs and miscellaneous job costs. Changes in job
performance, job conditions and estimated profitability, may result
in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period
in which the revisions are determined.

 

Recent
accounting pronouncements:

 

In
February 25, 2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02-Leases.The amendments in
this Update create Topic 842, Leases, and supersede the leases
requirements in Topic 840, Leases. The objective of Topic 842
is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply
to report useful information to users of financial statements about
the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a
lease. The FASB is issuing this Update to increase transparency and
comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and
lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key
information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any
entity that enters into a lease (as that term is defined in this
Update), with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this
Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The main difference between
previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and
lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as
operating leases under previous GAAP. The core principle of Topic
842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities
that arise from leases. All leases create an asset and a liability
for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,
Elements of Financial Statements, and, therefore, recognition of
those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement
over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and lease
liabilities to be recognized for most leases. A lessee should
recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to
make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease
term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a
lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be made in
optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to
exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise an option
to terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase
the underlying asset should be included in the measurement of lease
assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably
certain to exercise that purchase option. Reasonably certain is a
high threshold that is consistent with and intended to be applied
in the same way as the reasonably assured threshold in the previous
leases guidance. In addition, also consistent with the previous
leases guidance, a lessee (and a lessor) should exclude most
variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease
liabilities, other than those that depend on an index or a rate or
are in substance fixed payments. For leases with a term of 12
months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy
election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets
and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should
recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this
Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The
Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of
adopting this standard.

UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

In
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17- Income Taxes.  
The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to
reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification
Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to
identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be
reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the
information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP
requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and
assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified
statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of
deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that
deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in
a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in
this Update apply to all entities that present a classified
statement of financial position. The current requirement that
deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an
entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected
by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in progress of
evaluating future impact of adopting this
standard. 

 

On June
12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections
and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range
of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements
to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
effect on current accounting practice or create a significant
administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards
Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been
deleted. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this
Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition
guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the
issuance of this Update. Based on management’s assessment,
this ASU does not cause material impact on the Company's financial
statements.

 

In April
7, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-03-Interest-Imputation of Interest.
The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to
reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification
Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to
identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be
reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the
information provided to users of financial statements. To simplify
presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this Update
require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt
liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with
debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt
issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this Update.
For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. Based on management’s assessment, this ASU does
not cause material impact on the Company's financial
statements.

In
January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 Income
Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the
Concept of Extraordinary Items. The objective of this Update is to
simplify the income statement presentation requirements in Subtopic
225-20 by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items.
Extraordinary items are events and transactions that are
distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of
their occurrence. Eliminating the extraordinary classification
simplifies income statement presentation by altogether removing the
concept of extraordinary items from consideration. This Accounting
Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting
Standards Update 2014-220 Income Statement Extraordinary Items
(Subtopic 225-20), which has been deleted. Effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the
amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the
amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the
financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the
guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of
adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business
entities and all other entities. Based on management’s
assessment, this ASU does not cause material impact on the
Company's financial statements.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES




 

Litigation

 

In April
2014, Gregory Randolf, a former employee of the Company filed a
Class Action Labor Lawsuit against the Company in the Maryland
District Court. The lawsuit alleges that he and 48 other flaggers
of the Company were not paid overtime pay which in Maryland is time
and ½. The Company believes that Mr. Randolf’s testimony
as to the amount of hours he worked was completely false and that
he was correctly paid for the hours he worked per his time slips.
As of December 2015, the Company has offered $100,000 to settle the
case and is now waiting to hear if the Judge will accept the terms
of the settlement. The Company accrued contingent loss of $100,000
during the year ended December 31, 2014. No additional contingent
liability was accrued during the year ended December 31, 2015. On
April 28, 2016, the settlement agreement was approved by court and
judgment for plaintiffs was entered in the amount of $100,000. On
April 29, 2016, the company made payments to plaintiffs in the
total amount of $100,000.

 

In May,
2015, the Company filed a complaint against Riverport Insurance
Services (“Riverport”) in Circuit Court for Montgomery
County, Maryland, for failing to defend a workers’
compensation claim previously filed against the Company. The
Company is seeking a declaration from the Court that Riverport
owned the Company a duty to defend the subject workers’
compensation claim. The Company seeks recovery of attorneys’
fees and costs incurred in defending against the claim, and
attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in litigating the
complaint. Trial for this litigation was scheduled for June 2,
2016. On September 14, 2016, a judgment of the litigation against
Riverport was entered in favor of the Company in the amount of
approximately $45,000. No contingent gain was recorded by the
Company as of June 30, 2016.
