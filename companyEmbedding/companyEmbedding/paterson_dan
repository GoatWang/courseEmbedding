Equipment & TechnologyThe right solutions for your unique practice









Patterson works with a diverse group of manufacturer partners to connect you to the equipment and technology solutions that are right for your unique practice. Driven by a long history of innovation, we enable every practice to offer a best-in-class patient experience while improving efficiencies that enable practice growth. Every practice can benefit from innovations in equipment and technology. Among the many benefits new technology brings are improved diagnostics, optimized workflows, a boosted bottom line, and more satisfied patients.
Digital imaging products – both extraoral and intraoral – have an immediate impact on diagnostics and image quality. Beyond digital impressioning and restorations, CAD/CAM technology lets you take on implantology and orthodontic cases. And up-to-date operatory equipment enables smoother workflows and efficiencies. It’s not just through equipment and technology, either. Patterson also offers practice management software solutions that keep your practice running efficiently and effectively.

1Description







The Super System 4 Universal Tank from Paterson is constructed from high-impact polystyrene that stands up to high volume use. This tank has no hidden parts, and is always easy to keep clean. The Super System 4 Tanks are durable, easy to use, and provide consistent, even film development. It features a unique snap-in light trapping funnel for quick filling and emptying, to ensure even development and precise processing times. The Super System 4 Tank offers a choice of agitation methods; use inversion agitation,  rotary agitation with the removable agitator rod supplied, or a combination of both. The Paterson Universal Tank holds two 35mm film rolls or a single roll of 120/220 film. It comes with two multi-format reels for 35mm, 126, 127, 120, or 220 rolls.






										
												The thoughtful design of Super System 4 includes a funnel which locks in place to keep reels secure. And, as an extra safety feature, the cap cannot be locked if the funnel is improperly seated
										  
										 




										
												Chemicals pour without splash, and solution quantities are permanently indicated on the bottom of every tank
										  
										 




										
												All parts are interchangeable
										  
										 




										
												The Super System 4 is simpler to load, faster to fill and easier to clean than any other tank
										  
										 




										
												A large diameter, one-piece lid and funnel which clips into place positively and securely, enables the tank to be filled and emptied quickly

	Welcome to Paterson Products

	Manufacturers Agents to the Industrial, Hardware and Building Supply Industry



	Thank you for taking the time to visit our website and learn about our company.

	Paterson products is a thirty year old sales agency founded and operated by Jamey Paterson. The key to our agency’s success has been in the development of relationships and our commitment to servicing the products we sell.

	Having experience in the Building Materials Industry, this need to service the products as they were sold became apparent and crucial.

	With both Retail and Industrial/Wholesale accounts continually demanding more service, Paterson Products has been able to expand our concept of “We Service What We Sell” to meet the requirements of today’s market place.

	Currently the Paterson Products Team consists of 9 Sales & 6 Service Personnel throughout Western Canada.

	At Paterson Products we don’t want to be the biggest Agency, only the Best. We don’t feel the need to have 25-30 Companies to be successful, only the Best Companies.

	Paterson Products can offer your company the sales and service expertise that is needed to grow your Company in the expanding and demanding market of Western Canada.

	We hope that you find something in these pages that prompts you to call us directly, so we can begin to build that all-important relationship and subsequently determine if a working relationship could be mutually beneficial.

	We Look Forward To Meeting You!

	Sincerely

	Jamey Paterson
