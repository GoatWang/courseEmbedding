Skills and Qualifications
Ms. Turpin brings to our Board long experience as a retail executive, most recently as President and Chief Executive Officer of Limited Stores, where she worked in a multi-divisional retail structure similar to that of our Company. She previously served as a director of two other public companies, The Warnaco Group, Inc. and Stage Stores, Inc., and she served as chair of the compensation committees of those companies. Her strong retail and brand marketing background strongly complements the expertise of the Board, and her past service as chair of the compensation committees of other public retail companies provides particularly useful background for her service on our Compensation Committee.
