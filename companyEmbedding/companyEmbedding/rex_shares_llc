The Secret Appeal To Shorting VIX | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»The Secret Appeal To Shorting VIXMar. 28, 2017  7:00 AM ET|| Includes: SVXY, UVXY, VMAX, VMIN, VXX, XIVby: REX Shares, LLCREX Shares, LLC Gold, ETF investing, macro, VIXRex SharesAs many die-hard VIX sellers already know, it is very possible to make money with short VIX positions without any significant movement at all in the VIX. In this article, we will briefly explain the factors that go into this. If you have not read Greg King's previous article on shorting VIX, we would recommend you do so before reading this one. Taking the period of time since January 3, the first trading day of 2017 to March 16, (the day of this writing), we see this phenomenon at work. During that time, the VIX index moved from 12.85 to 11.21 while hitting a high of 12.85 and a low of 10.58 during the period. Overall, the net move was -12.76% and the distance between the low and the high as measured from the starting level of VIX for the period was 18.1%. So even if someone picked the high to short VIX and the low to buy it back, timing the market perfectly, the maximum return would have been +18.1%. Now keep in mind VIX is uninvestable as is, and that does not factor in transaction costs. However, during that same time frame, a hypothetical static short position in continuously rolling VIX futures, as represented by the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index would have gained a staggering +31.99%. Moreover, a daily compounding position in shorter duration VIX futures contracts, as represented by the returns on the net asset value of the REX VolMAXX Short VIX Weekly Futures Strategy ETF (NYSEMKT:VMIN), would have gained 47.47% over this same time frame (note: past performance is certainly no guarantee of future results, with respect to the VIX, VIX futures, or VMIN). Still how is it possible that short VIX futures positions have risen more than the level of the VIX has fallen? Spoiler Alert: The answer lies in the steepness of the VIX futures curve. Let's remember that a short position in futures of any kind has three potential sources of return. First, is the most boring. Collateral yield. Futures are leverage instruments, and so the cash collateral supporting them must have a yield to it. Ten years ago, this made a lot more of a difference than it does today because rates were higher, but it still counts for something.
 A second source of return is the movements in the underlying index itself (in this case VIX). How the VIX moves up and down affects the corresponding prices of the VIX futures. And even though it may seem like a foregone conclusion that up movements in the VIX equate to up movements in the VIX futures, that may not always be the case, although most of the time it is. Which leads us to our third source of returns, roll yield. This last source is what tends to confuse investors the most. Holding a position for a time period longer than the duration of the underlying futures contract means the position must be rolled. For example, before April expiry, an April VIX contract that has been sold short must be bought back and the May VIX contract sold in order to maintain the short position. Through this contract swapping process, a profit or loss is achieved. 

 The above graph shows the VIX futures curve as of the close on March 16, 2017; we can see that the March, April, and May prices are 11.93, 13.28, and 14.33 respectively. Let's assume the curve were to stay the same shape over time and that the level of the VIX does not move. If we assume the April contract (now at 13.28) follows the curve down, and in a month, closes where the March futures contract is now (at 11.93), that short position would increase by the difference (1.35 or around 10.17% on the shorted notional). The punch line here is that, given our assumptions, spot VIX has not moved but value of the short VIX futures position would have increased by 10.17% in one month. This is the secret appeal to shorting VIX. The steepness of the curve lately has rewarded short position holders handsomely, even though VIX has not moved much. Although they are bearing the risk of VIX rallying unexpectedly (a significant one), many still choose to employ this strategy. And now you know why.
 Footnotes The market price return for VMIN is 47.26% for the same period. NAV return for VMIN from inception (5/2/16) to 12/31/2016 was 81.24%, and the market price return for VMIN was 81.08% for the same period. The fund's expense ratio is 1.45%. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Short-term performance is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Shares are bought and sold at market prices and not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. NAV is calculated using prices as of 4:15 PM Eastern Time. The market price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and the Ask price as of the close of the exchange. Market price returns do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. About REX REX Shares, LLC ("REX") creates intelligently engineered alternatives ETFs that seek to help investors navigate turbulent markets and preserve wealth. REX was founded with a focus on gold and volatility based investment strategies. REX is based in Westport, CT. Rex Shares Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co. (One Freedom Valley Dr., Oaks, PA, 19456), which is not affiliated with Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC or any of its affiliates. Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds' prospectus, which may be obtained at www.rexetf.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. VMIN is actively managed. Active management may increase transaction costs. The VIX Index is not directly investable. VMIN expects to invest primarily in VIX futures contracts, which are considered commodities.
 The use of derivatives, such as futures contracts, swap agreements and options, presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying security, asset, rate or index. Gains or losses in a derivative may be magniﬁed and may be much greater than the derivative's original cost. The derivatives may not always be liquid. This could have a negative effect on the Funds' ability to achieve its investment objective and may result in losses. Short positions lose value as the security's price increases. The loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. Short sales involve leverage because the Fund borrows securities and then sells them, effectively leveraging its assets. The return for VMIN for periods other than a full trading day will differ from VMIN's stated daily inverse investment objective. During periods of high volatility, VMIN may not perform as expected and may have losses when an investor may have expected gains if VMIN is held for a period that is different than one trading day. ETF shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange.

REX Shares, LLC Key Developments

REX Shares, LLC Introduces Gold Hedged Equity ETFs
Apr 5 16
REX Shares, LLC announced the launch of two exchange-traded funds (ETFs): the REX Gold Hedged S&P 500 ETF and the REX Gold Hedged FTSE Emerging Markets ETF. Both funds seek to allow for investors to diversify their portfolios by accessing exposure to gold without reducing equity allocations. The funds also can help protect against the risk of a weakening U.S. dollar through gold exposure. This marks the first opportunity for ETF investors to access both gold and stocks in this way. Of the two funds, GHS is benchmarked against the S&P 500 Dynamic Gold Hedged Index and GHE is benchmarked against the FTSE Emerging Gold Overlay Index. Each fund provides exposure to its respective equity index allocation and additionally buys gold futures contracts to gain long gold exposure.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds' summary and full prospectuses, which may be obtained by calling 1-844-REX-1414. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.
The price of gold is volatile and may be affected by a variety of factors, including the global gold supply and demand and investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation. Developments affecting the value of gold may have a significant impact on the Fund. There is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value.
Fixed-income assets will decline in value because of rising interest rates.
The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying security, asset, rate or index. Gains or losses in a derivative may be magnified and may be much greater than the derivative’s original cost. The derivatives may not always be liquid. This could have a negative effect on the Funds’ ability to achieve its investment objective and may result in losses.
In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. In emerging markets, these risks are heightened, and lower trading volumes may occur.  Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
The Funds will invest in exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded funds, and will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles. The Funds’ performance will be directly related to the performance of those investments.
The Funds are non-diversified. 
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Rex NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange.

Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC serves as the investment advisor and Vident Investment Advisory serves as sub advisor to the fund. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co., which is not affiliated with Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC or any of its affiliates. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds' summary and full prospectuses, which may be obtained by calling 1-844-REX-1414. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.
The price of gold is volatile and may be affected by a variety of factors, including the global gold supply and demand and investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation. Developments affecting the value of gold may have a significant impact on the Fund. There is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value.
Fixed-income assets will decline in value because of rising interest rates.
The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying security, asset, rate or index. Gains or losses in a derivative may be magnified and may be much greater than the derivative’s original cost. The derivatives may not always be liquid. This could have a negative effect on the Funds’ ability to achieve its investment objective and may result in losses.
In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. In emerging markets, these risks are heightened, and lower trading volumes may occur.  Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
The Funds will invest in exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded funds, and will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles. The Funds’ performance will be directly related to the performance of those investments.
The Funds are non-diversified. 
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Rex NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange.

Returns are average annualized total returns, except those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Short term performance is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Shares are bought and sold at market price and not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
* Distribution Yield is the annual yield an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The yield represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV.
** 30-Day SEC Yield is a standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows for fairer comparisons among bond funds. It is based on the most recent month end. This figure reflects the interest earned during the period after deducting the Fund’s expenses for the period.

Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.
The price of gold is volatile and may be affected by a variety of factors, including the global gold supply and demand and investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation. Developments affecting the value of gold may have a significant impact on the Fund. There is no assurance that gold will maintain its long-term value.
Fixed-income assets will decline in value because of rising interest rates.
The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying security, asset, rate or index. Gains or losses in a derivative may be magnified and may be much greater than the derivative’s original cost. The derivatives may not always be liquid. This could have a negative effect on the Funds’ ability to achieve its investment objective and may result in losses.
In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from economic or political instability in other nations. In emerging markets, these risks are heightened, and lower trading volumes may occur.  Investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility.
The Funds will invest in exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded funds, and will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles. The Funds’ performance will be directly related to the performance of those investments.
The Funds are non-diversified. 
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Rex NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange.

Returns are average annualized total returns, except those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative. Performance quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so you may have a gain or loss when shares are sold. Current performance may be higher or lower than that quoted. Short term performance is not a good indication of the fund's future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Shares are bought and sold at market price and not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

S&P 500® VIX Short-Term Futures Index

“Weighted average time to expiration” for the Fund is calculated as the sum, for all instruments held by the Fund, of (a) the time to expiration for each instrument held by the Fund that provides exposure to VIX Futures Contracts, multiplied by (b) the ratio of (i) the Fund’s notional exposure to such instrument divided by (ii) the total notional exposure of instruments held by the Fund that provides exposure to VIX Futures Contracts.
“Time to expiration” for a VIX Futures Contract is calculated as the number of calendar days between the current day and the date such VIX Futures Contract expires.
“Time to expiration” for instruments other than VIX Futures Contracts is calculated as the sum, for all VIX Futures Contracts held by or tracked by such security, of (a) the time to expiration for each VIX Futures Contract held by or tracked by the security, multiplied by (b) the ratio of (i) the security’s notional exposure to such VIX Futures Contract divided by (i) the security’s total notional exposure to VIX Futures Contracts.
“Weighted average time to expiration” for the S&P 500® VIX Short-Term Futures Index is equal to time to expiration for SPVXSP.

 Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC serves as the investment advisor and Vident Investment Advisory serves as sub advisor to the fund. The Funds are distributed by SEI Investments Distribution Co., which is not affiliated with Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC or any of its affiliates. Check the background of SIDCO on FINRA's BrokerCheck.

Carefully consider the Funds’ investment objectives, risk factors, charges and expenses before investing. This and additional information can be found in the Funds’ prospectus, which may be obtained by calling 1-844-REX-1414. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. These Funds are actively managed and there are no guarantees investments selected and strategies employed will achieve the intended results. Active management may also increase transaction costs. The Funds expect to invest primarily in VIX futures contracts, which are considered commodities.
The use of derivatives, such as futures contracts, swap agreements and options, presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities. Changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying security, asset, rate or index. Gains or losses in a derivative may be magniﬁed and may be much greater than the derivative’s original cost. The derivatives may not always be liquid. This could have a negative effect on the Funds’ ability to achieve its investment objective and may result in losses.
Unlike most ETFs, VMAX expects to effect its creations and redemptions in exchange for a significant cash component and a smaller component of in-kind securities. Paying redemption proceeds in cash rather than through in-kind delivery may require VMAX to dispose of or sell portfolio investments and this may cause VMAX to recognize gains or losses that it might not have incurred if it had made a redemption in-kind. As a result, VMAX may pay out higher or lower annual capital gains distributions than ETFs that redeem in kind.
The VIX Index is not directly investable. The settlement price of a VIX Futures Contract is based on the calculation that determines the level of the VIX Index.  As a result, the behavior of a VIX Futures Contract may be different from traditional futures contracts whose settlement price is based on a specific tradable asset. When economic uncertainty increases and there is an increase in expected volatility, the value of VIX Futures Contracts will likely also increase. Similarly, when economic uncertainty recedes and there is an associated decrease in expected volatility, the value of VIX Futures Contracts will likely also decrease. Futures markets are highly volatile and the use of or exposure to futures contracts may increase volatility of the Fund’s NAV. Futures contracts are also subject to liquidity risk. Several factors may affect the price and/or liquidity of VIX Futures Contracts, including, but not limited to: prevailing market prices and forward volatility levels of the U.S. stock markets, equity securities included in the S&P 500® and prevailing market prices of options on the S&P 500®, the VIX Index, options on the VIX, VIX Futures, or any other financial instruments related to the S&P 500® and the VIX or VIX Futures; interest rates; economic, financial, political, regulatory, geographical, biological or judicial events that affect the current volatility reading of the VIX or the market price or forward volatility of the U.S. stock markets; supply and demand as well as hedging activities in the listed and over-the-counter equity derivatives markets; disruptions in trading of the S&P 500®, futures contracts on the S&P 500® or options on the S&P 500®; and the level of contango or backwardation in the VIX Futures Contracts market.
VMAX’s investment strategy is subject to risks related to rolling. The price of futures contracts further from expiration may be higher (“contango”) or lower ( “backwardation”). Because of the frequency with which the Fund expects to roll VIX Futures Contracts, the impact of such contango or backwardation may be greater than if the Fund experienced less portfolio turnover.
Short sales are transactions in which VMIN sells a security it does not own. If the security goes down in price between the time VMIN sells the security and buys it back, VMIN will realize a gain on the transaction: if the security goes up in price during the period, VMIN will realize a loss. Because a short position loses value as the security’s price increases and the market price of the shorted security could increase without limit, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited. Short sales involve leverage because the Fund borrows securities and then sells them, effectively leveraging its assets.
Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. VolMAXX NAVs are calculated using prices as of 4:00 PM Eastern Time. The closing price is the Mid-Point between the Bid and Ask price as of the close of exchange.
The Funds will invest in exchange-traded notes and exchange-traded funds, and will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles. The Funds’ performance will be directly related to the performance of those investments.
The return for investors that invest in VMIN for periods other than a full trading day will differ from the VMIN’s stated daily inverse investment objective. During periods of high volatility, the VMIN may not perform as expected and may have losses when an investor may have expected gains if the VMIN is held for a period that is different than one trading day.
The Funds are non-diversiﬁed.

Why Gold Hedged Investing?















Gold Hedged Investing


 


The Investment Case 
Why Gold Hedged Investing?
 “Gold hedged investing” is a method of accessing gold returns that keeps current asset allocations intact. Gold is the world’s oldest currency and gaining exposure to it can diversify investor portfolios away from their home currency. Like with any currency, exposure to gold can be taken either in physical form or by synthetic exposure. gold hedged investing involves “porting” gold returns into an existing portfolio by accessing exposure via gold futures positions overlaid as a “hedge” onto an equity position. Accessing gold this way, rather than via any physical-based holdings, conserves investment capital within the portfolio for other productive uses.  more...less...

Frequently Asked Questions    

What is "gold hedged" investing?
Gold hedged investing is the application of an overlay to an
investment portfolio that gives the portfolio exposure to the
price movements of gold.


Why not invest directly in gold?
A direct investment in gold, such as owning either physical
gold or a fund that owns physical gold, requires an up-front
payment to purchase the asset. To finance this up-front
payment, an investor may need to sell other assets, such as
equities, which can change an asset allocation mix. A futures
contract, by contrast, is an agreement to purchase the asset at
a future point in time. Instead, gold hedged investing takes
exposure to the price fluctuations of gold via futures in an
amount approximately equal to the amount of equity
exposure, and rolls the futures before they expire.


What makes gold a currency?
Gold is considered to be "money" or a "currency" by many
notable investors and financiers including J. Pierpont Morgan,
Alan Greenspan, and Ray Dalio (founder of Bridgewater, at
times the world's largest hedge fund). It is considered so
because it meets the six tests necessary for any substance to
be considered a currency: durability, portability, divisibility,
uniformity, acceptability, and limited supply.


How is gold a US dollar hedge?
The value of a currency can only be measured vs. another
currency or vs. a basket of goods. In that sense, gold is a USD
hedge when measured in terms of gold, as the correlation is
-1.0. However, gold may still be viewed as a good overall USD
hedge when compared against a basket of foreign currencies
that include EUR, JPY, GBP and other major currencies, as
gold has -0.4 correlation with the basket's change against
the dollar over the period from December 29, 2005 through
December 30, 2015.


Can gold act as a hedge during tail events?
Gold can reduce portfolio losses during some, but not all,
events that give rise to sudden, extreme market downturns.
These downturns are often referred to as "tail events." In
particular, gold can reduce portfolio losses during financial-related
economic downturns, which may give rise to a "flight
to quality." For more information, see World Gold Council:
Gold: hedging against tail risk, September 2010.


How is gold an EM currency hedge?
Emerging market currencies can often be expensive to hedge,
both because of interest rate differentials and high transaction
costs that may be associated with trading such currencies.
However, emerging market currency may fall sharply during
"flight to quality" situations. Because flight to quality may
positively impact the price of gold, gold can act as a hedge
against the risk of this type of situation.


Why not gold hedge my own portfolio?
An investor with the ability to trade gold futures contracts and
who was willing to periodically roll and rebalance their gold
futures exposure could gold hedge their own portfolio.


Does gold diversify a portfolio?
Historically, gold has shown low and sometimes
negative correlations to equity markets while exhibiting
positive returns over long time periods. On this basis, gold is
generally considered a valid way to diversify equity portfolios.


Is there "contango" or "backwardation" risk?
Yes. If gold hedged investing takes gold exposure via futures,
the total performance of the investment will be affected if the
future level of gold is higher than the current price of gold (a
condition typically referred to as "contango") or lower than the
current price of gold (a condition typically referred to as
"backwardation"). However, because it is relatively
straightforward to hold and store gold, the future price of gold
may experience less fluctuation relative to its current price
than may be the case for commodities that are perishable or
expensive to store.
