Our Team
Our Investment Advisor Representatives all act as fiduciaries for our advisory clients, striving to meet their specified objectives while using strategies that seek to protect their wealth.  Our profession is research-driven financial advice, rather than product-driven financial distribution.  Quite simply, we manage our clients’ investments using the same proprietary principles and strategies we use for our own accounts and those of our families.
Guided by our research and investment principles, we construct each client’s portfolio based on their best interests.  As objective investors, we conduct independent research before forming conclusions.  Once formed, we then seek to disprove these conclusions.  Thinking through the risks and problems of a particular investment strategy, and working backwards from there, is central to our investment approach.  We constantly ask the question, “What if… then what?” and then diligently seek the answer on behalf of our clients.
Our clients’ assets are allocated into the Jacobi Portfolios, which comprise a set of proprietary investment allocations.

Welcome to Jacobi Capital Management

Providing independent financial advice since 19921
Client-focused firm in a product-focused industry
Multi-disciplinary investment approach
Actively managed, proprietary portfolios which follow The Jacobi Method

 
Jacobi’s founder, Michael Hirthler, was named among Barron’s Magazine’s Top 1,000 Financial Advisors in the nation in both 2011 and 2012.2
1 Jacobi Capital Management, LLC was formed as a Registered Investment Adviser in 2008. The firm was originally founded in 1992 by Michael Hirthler as a branch office of LPL Financial.
2 Source: *Barron’s 2011 and 2012 “Top 1,000 Advisors,” as identified by Barron’s magazine, using quantitative and qualitative criteria and selected from a pool of over 4,000 nominations. Advisors in the Top 1,000 Financial Advisors have a minimum of seven years of financial services experience, and were selected based on three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor’s returns are dictated largely by the risk tolerance of clients. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor’s regulatory record. Neither Jacobi Capital Management nor its Financial Advisors pay a fee to Barron’s in exchange for the rating. Barron’s is a registered trademark of Dow Jones & Company, L.P. All rights reserved.

Jacobi Capital Management, LLC














 What’s needed is an antidote, and in my opinion, that’s quantification.  If you quantify, you won’t necessarily rise to brilliance, but neither will you sink into craziness.
- Warren Buffett
 

The Jacobi Method
The Jacobi Method is a multi-disciplinary approach based on behavioral economics, psychology, finance, engineering and sociology. Our focus within these disciplines was inspired by the studies of the great mathematician Carl Gustav Jacobi, as followed in the writings of Berkshire Hathaway’s Charlie Munger.
The Jacobi Method is rooted in the following Seven Timeless and Universal Certainties of Finance:

Your investments should be actively and tactically managed, based on quantification.
Behavioral bias and emotions frequently lead investors astray.
Understanding valuation helps determine your range of possible outcomes.
“The four most expensive words in the English language are, ‘This time it’s different.’” – John Templeton
The patient investor is confident.
Investment costs impact investment returns.
“Invert. Always invert.” – Carl Gustav Jacobi
