SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Voya Infrastructure, Industrials and Materials Fund (NYSE:    IDE) today announced important information concerning its distribution declared in June 2017. This press release is issued as required by the Fund's Managed Distribution Plan (the "Plan") and an exemptive order received from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Trustees has approved the implementation of the Plan to make quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders, stated in terms of a fixed amount per common share. This information is sent to you for informational purposes only and is an estimate of the sources of the July distribution. It is not determinative of the tax character of the Fund's distributions for the 2017 calendar year. Shareholders should note that the Fund's total regular distribution amount is subject to change as a result of market conditions or other factors.








The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are estimates, are not being provided for tax reporting purposes and the distribution may later be determined to be from other sources including realized short-term gains, long-term gains, to the extent permitted by law, and return of capital. The actual amounts and sources for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
Distribution Period: Second Quarter 2017, Payable July 17, 2017Distribution Amount per Common Share: $0.290
The following table sets forth an estimate of the sources of the Fund's July distribution and its cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date.  Amounts are expressed on a per common share basis and as a percentage of the distribution amount.

IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE: You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund's Plan. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income.' The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Section 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations.  The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
Set forth in the table below is information relating to the Fund's performance based on its net asset value (NAV) for certain periods.




 Average annual total return at NAV for the five year period ended on June 30, 20171 
 8.55% 


 Annualized current distribution rate expressed as a percentage of NAV as of June 30, 20172 
 7.23%

 11.22% 


 Cumulative fiscal year to date distribution rate as a percentage of NAV as of June 30, 20174

 1 
 Average annual total return at NAV represents the compound average of the annual NAV total returns of the Fund for the five-year period ended on June 30, 2017. 


 2 
 The annualized current distribution rate is the cumulative distribution rate annualized as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of June 30, 2017. 


 3 
 Cumulative total return at NAV is the percentage change in the Fund's NAV for the period from the beginning of its fiscal year to June 30, 2017 including distributions paid and assuming reinvestment of those distributions. 


 4 
 Cumulative fiscal year distribution rate for the period from the year-to-date period as a percentage of the Fund's NAV as of June 30, 2017. 




Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance quoted represents past performance. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.
Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value.  The market price of Fund shares may vary from net asset value based on factors affecting the supply and demand for shares, such as Fund distribution rates relative to similar investments, investors' expectations for future distribution changes, the clarity of the Fund's investment strategy and future return expectations, and investors' confidence in the underlying markets in which the Fund invests.  Fund shares are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of principal invested.  No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund.  An investment in a Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  Before investing, prospective investors should consider carefully the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses.
Certain statements made on behalf of the Fund in this release are forward-looking statements. The Fund's actual future results may differ significantly from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including but not limited to a decline in value in equity markets in general or the Fund's investments specifically. Neither the Fund nor Voya Investment Management undertake any responsibility to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement.
This information should not be used as a basis for legal and/or tax advice. In any specific case, the parties involved should seek the guidance and advice of their own legal and tax counsel.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund's Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC ("Rafferty") has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund's Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund's daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

1The Adviser has contractually agreed to limit expenses of the Fund. This expense limitation agreement excludes interest, taxes, investment-related costs, leverage expenses, and extraordinary expenses and may be subject to possible recoupment. Please see the Fund's prospectus for more information.
					

2The expense limit will continue through at least March 1, 2018. The Fund is operating under the contractual expense limit.    
					

3Total investment return at market value measures the change in the market value of your investment assuming reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the Fundâs dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return at market value is not annualized for periods less than one year.
					


The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
			 
		



Principal Risks
			All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. Price volatility, liquidity, and other risks that accompany an investment in equity securities of domestic and foreign companies, and small and mid sized capitalized companies. International investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. Risks of foreign investing are generally intensified for investments in emerging markets. Options RiskUnder normal market conditions, the Fund seeks to manage risk by employing an integrated options collar strategy. The Fund’s collar strategy includes: employing put spreads by purchasing and selling put options and writing call options on energy and materials indices (“Resource Indices”) and/or ETFs, correlated with the Fund’s portfolio, or securities held in the Fund’s. The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon the expiration or closing of the option contract. When an option is exercised, the proceeds on sales of the underlying security for a written call option or purchased put option or the purchase cost of the security for a written put option or a purchased call option is adjusted by the amount of premium received or paid. The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for profit if the market price of the security increases and the option is exercised. The risk in buying an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Risks may also arise from an illiquid secondary market or from the inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contract. A decision as to whether, when and how to buy or sell options under the Fund’s strategy involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. When a option purchased or sold by the Fund is exercised or closed out, the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities or to deliver portfolio securities to the option purchaser to satisfy its obligations when it would not otherwise choose to do so, or the Fund may choose to sell portfolio securities to realize gains to offset the losses realized upon option exercise. Such sales or delivery would involve transaction costs borne by the Fund and may also result in realization of taxable capital gains, including short-term capital gains taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and may adversely impact the Fund’s after-tax returns. This Fund has additional risks which you should consider, such as: Infrastructure-Related Investment Risk, Industrials Sector Risk, Materials Sector Risk, Foreign Investment and Emerging Markets Risk, Equity Risk, Small-Cap and Mid-Cap Companies Risk, Investment and Market Risk, Derivatives Risk, Interest Rate Risk, Illiquid Securities Risk, Distribution Risk, Tax Risk, Foreign (non-U.S.) Currency Risk, Portfolio Turnover Risk, Management Risk, Initial Public Offering Risk, Depositary Receipts Risk, Securities Lending Risk, Market Disruption and Geopolitical Risk, Current Capital Markets Environment Risk, Anti-Takeover Provisions, No Temporary Defensive Positions Risk, Sub-Custody Risk, Short Sales Risk, Preferred Stock Risk, Convertible Securities Risk, High-Yield Lower-Grade Debt Securities Risk and Leverage Risk. These and other risks are described more fully in the Fund’s prospectus and the most current annual or semi-annual report. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. Consider the Fund’s investment objective, risk, and charges and expenses carefully before investing.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund's Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC ("Rafferty") has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund's Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund's daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
