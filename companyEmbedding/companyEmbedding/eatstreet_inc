EatStreet Appoints Suzanne Harms as Chief Marketing Officer
Apr 6 17
EatStreet has hired former Duluth Trading Company marketing executive Suzanne Harms as its first chief marketing officer. Harms is responsible for driving EatStreet's growth through heightened brand awareness, customer acquisition, retention and customer insights. She will also serve as EatStreet's chief creative officer responsible for building a coveted, fan-focused brand.

Santiago joins EatStreet from Riot Games Inc., where he was the Head of Finance managing all of their business units. Santiago, a California native, has more than 15 years of financial leadership experience for digital and consumer product companies. He now makes the crosscountry trek to the Midwest after living in California his entire life. Over his career, Richard also served as a CFO at Red 5 Studios and U4ia Games. Prior to that, he progressed through Activision, the company responsible for blockbuster video games Guitar Hero and Call of Duty, where he progressed from Manager of Finance to ultimately a Group Vice President of Finance.


EatStreet Partners with UberRUSH to Improve Food Delivery in Chicago
Jan 28 16
EatStreet and Uber announced plans that will further expand the companies' online food delivery reach beginning with the Chicago market. EatStreet will integrate a new private API for UberRUSH into existing infrastructure that will optimize restaurant delivery placed through EatStreet's online and mobile platforms. Partnering with UberRUSH to power additional delivery opportunities will benefit both EatStreet diners and restaurant partners. This back-end solution will allow small- to mid-size restaurants an additional opportunity into the quickly growing food delivery space. Large restaurants, who may already have that capability, will be able to leverage this on-demand feature to get food to customers even faster.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/22/2017
            

                BBB has determined that Eatstreet, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.

                   3.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
