Pura Vida Investments





















Pura Vida Investments is a fundamentally driven, long/short healthcare-focused investment firm designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns by leveraging the team’s deep healthcare sector and medical expertise.  The firm was founded in 2012 and its partners include Efrem Kamen and Frank Litvack MD.
The firm’s portfolio is managed by Efrem Kamen and is run in a market neutral fashion, investing across most areas of healthcare, including medical devices, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, tools, life sciences and healthcare services. The fund has an optional 10% allocation to designated investments, allowing participation in private and certain illiquid public securities, which is managed by Frank Litvack MD.
The objective of the fund is to generate alpha on both longs and shorts by identifying inflections in company specific valuations as well as to capitalize on structural changes in the healthcare macro landscape. The firm strives to look past day-to-day volatility and to hone in on major value shifts over the medium to longer term.
