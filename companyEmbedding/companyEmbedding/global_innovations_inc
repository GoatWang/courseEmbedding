Home Automation Made EasyFlip of the Switch Makes Coming Home ExcitingPreviousNext123

Our Mission
At e5 Global Innovations, we believe in a world where home automation is easy, secure and free of the planned obsolescence that is pre-packaged in so many of our consumer electronics products.  Our product pipeline includes simple, plug & play devices that help you expand and control your light switch.
By giving homeowners more control, we empower them to live a brighter life.  By expanding the function of the wall switch, we utilize existing technology that is engrained in our daily activities to automate lighting.  We do these things using products that require no internet connection, no battery, no software update.
Our products will never crash, shutdown or become obsolete.  We expect our products to be quickly assimilated into our customers lives.

OUR PROCESS
 
CRU Global Innovations (“CRU”) is lighting the future. Printed Light, Printed Battery and Printed Solar is the process of creating a light, battery and/or solar panel onto a paper-thin flexible light-weight medium. The resulting product becomes a highly efficient light source, battery and/or solar panel or a combination of the three.
 
CRU Global Innovations has the exclusive license rights to sell and distribute products using the nano technology printed lights, individually & incorporating nano printed batteries, and individually & incorporating nanoprinted solar panels manufactured by Triton Solar to third parties. If you have an interest in becoming a distributor, please visit our  contact page.
































OUR STORY
 
"Cru" by definition, is a vineyard or group of vineyards, especially one of recognized quality. It is a French wine term which is traditionally translated as "growth". These principles of growth, community, and premium quality build the foundation for which this company is founded upon. The executive team of CRU GI had extensive experience in various fields. In all areas, we apply the same fundamentals of growth by connecting with others to build enterprises & each other up. Triton Solar, product manufacturers of printed light, battery, and solar technologies, came to CRU because of its expertise in growing lucrative businesses. They knew we could successfully share with the world how incredible this upcoming technology is. Given the task, CRU formed a team of qualified individuals who execute this vision with passion & pride together. And so, that is how CRU Global Innovations began.

 “School Safe” The Simple School Lockdown Solution

Allows the door to be locked in seconds without leaving the classroom.


Is readily affordable for every classroom and school.
Our ProductsSchool SafeBuy Now








School Safe, the simple and affordable school lockdown device, is an ‘anti-latch’ device, not a lock. It operates in conjunction with the doors existing lock. School Safe prevents the door from latching by keeping it slightly ajar.  The School Safe lever extends about 3/8 of an inch out from the jamb or door, thereby preventing the strike from entering into the strike plate and latching. So the door, even though locked, will never latch until the School Safe lever is flipped thereby allowing the door to close all the way.  Since it was already locked, the classroom is immediately secured without having to use keys, open the door, or venture into the hallway. School Safe comes in four different configurations because a door can open four different ways. NOTE: Each School Safe lockdown device ordered comes with a protective pad, a lock down label, and an alcohol wipe.


School Safe Double DoorBuy Now








School Safe Double Doors (SSDD) is a new school lockdown anti-latch device designed specifically for double doors that open out and do not have a center mullion. Many double doors used in gyms, auditoriums or hallway exits do not have center jambs or mullions. SSDD attaches vertically on the inside of the door near the top with the ‘pin’ end up and the ‘pull tab’ end down. As with regular School Safe, SSDD extends about 3/8 of an inch out from the door, preventing the strike from entering into the strike plate and latching. So the door, even though locked, cannot latch until the SSDD lever is pulled down allowing the door to close all the way.  Since it was already locked, the door is immediately secured without having to use keys.


SCHOOL SAFE SECURITY FILMBuy Now













School Safe Security Film (SSSF) is one of our new school lockdown products that installs on the door glass and allows the room to be viewed from the hallway when the lights in the room are on, but becomes reflective, like a mirror, on the hallway side of the door when the lights in the room are turned off. This eliminates the need for the teacher to cover the door window.  School Safe Security Film comes pre-cut to fit many standard door window sizes, or can be custom cut to your specifications. It can easily be installed by your maintenance staff using our SSSF Installation Kit.

School Safe Digital – Designed for quick and efficient school lockdownsInquire








The School Safe Digital mobile app is an extensible and affordable security platform that lets administrators take control of their existing electronic door control mechanism and PA systems with the push of a button. For less than the cost of a cell phone plan you can empower school staff by allowing them to initiate a school lock-down from any authorized and configured smart phone, tablet, or desktop PC. This significantly reduces the amount of time between the recognition of a threat and the initiation of a school lock-down or other lock-down event..
For the basic School Safe Digital system there is a one time modest installation fee based on the size of the school and/or the number of buildings. The monthly maintenance and monitoring charge is less than that of a typical cell phone plan.
The School Safe Digital mobile application easily integrates with existing electronic door locking systems  and public announcement systems and provides an easy to use method of mass communication. School Safe Digital can also be used to make PA announcements unrelated to emergency events.
To purchase School Safe Digital, please contact us so we can create a customized package for your school or district. We also offer a 15% discount on regular School Safe purchases for school districts that use School Safe Digital.


What Our Clients Say

 

“With School Safe, as a teacher and a parent it gives me a sense of security knowing that should we need to lockdown the building quickly, all I need to do is flip a switch and I don’t have to go rummaging across my desk to find my keys.” “When I talk to parents about School Safe, I find that they are very excited knowing that our school has taken this step to protect their children.”


Kem TeglerTeacher 
 

“I think that School Safe and Global Innovations, with the development of this product, is very intriguing to me because it provides a cost effective way for school districts to address their lockdown procedures. With the advent of 911 and other terrorist incidents, such as Columbine, it’s a very high priority for the school districts. That becomes problematic for the fire service to gain entrance and egress to individual classrooms because of lockdown situations. I think it’s a good compromise that can provide lockdown capability, but we can also mitigate our search and rescue from a life safety standpoint in a much faster way.”


Eric LobsteinFire Department Battalion Chief 
 

“As we work with the sheriff’s department and the fire department on our safety plan, I was pleased when one of our local firemen met with me and talked about this product. Because it showed me that it was something that was not only supported by our school but was also supported by the agencies that support our school in an emergency.” “I was really pleased to find out that for a couple hundred dollars School Safe puts all of the classrooms, in a very large school such as ours, in safe mode when we lockdown.”


Pat HornPhD., Principal 
 

“When School Safe staff came to me, they gave me the device to look at, and the first thing I noticed was how simple it was. It’s not a big mechanical device. It’s very simple and easy to use. Again, under stress peoples motor skills tend to diminish and with this device it’s very easy to implement. It’s always in the same place. It rotates very easily and it’s perfect for a lockdown situation.” “Budget concerns are a big thing now especially in schools and businesses. So this device is exceptional when you think about the safety of kids, the safety in the workplace, and just the amount of money to get this device installed is very minimal.”


Darrell HixsonRetired SWAT Officer
