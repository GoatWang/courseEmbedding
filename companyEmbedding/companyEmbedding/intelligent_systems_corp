Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

 For over forty years, Intelligent Systems has identified, created and grown technology focused companies, principally through majority owned subsidiaries to which we devote extensive management time and resources. Throughout our history, the company has developed and supported entrepreneurial companies with promising technologies that address real business needs which we believe can create shareholder value over time.


Following the sale of our ChemFree Corporation subsidiary in early 2015, we are now focused on our CoreCard Software business, expanding our footprint in the FinTech industry through internal growth and exploring related strategic initiatives.
