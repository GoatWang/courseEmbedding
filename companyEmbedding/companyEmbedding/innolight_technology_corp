InnoLight Technology Announces Volume Shipments of 17 100G QSFP28 Products and the Introduction of 400G OSFP at OFC 2017
Mar 20 17
InnoLight Technology announced volume shipments of a complete suite of QSFP28 products. InnoLight also announced the availability of 400G OSFP at OFC 2017. With the convergence of Telecom, Mobile, Enterprise and Data Center networks into cloud network architecture, the demand for ubiquitous, high bandwidth and low cost optics just exploded. 100G QSFP28 has become the de-facto standard for optical interconnects for the cloud networks. On a /Gbit basis, 100G QSFP28 is more cost effective than 10G SFP+ and 40G QSFP+, and in some cases, by a significant margin. Due to this unrivaled price performance, all industry participants are rapidly rolling out QSFP28 connections. To support this rapid adoption, InnoLight has introduced the most comprehensive portfolio of QSFP28 optics in the industry: Beyond 100G, the next milestone is 400G. To enable 400G expansion, InnoLight will introduce and conduct a live demo of 400G OSFP optics at OFC in Los Angeles this year.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately US$         million, or approximately US$         million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses
payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial offering price
of US$         per ADS, the midpoint of the range shown on the front cover page
of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
ADSs by the selling shareholders. A US$1.00 change in the assumed initial public
offering price of US$         per ADS would, in the case of an increase,
increase and, in the case of a decrease, decrease the net proceeds of this
offering by US$         million, or approximately US$         million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, under
these assumptions.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We intend
to use US$         million to expand our 100G production capacity, US$        
million to strengthen our research and development capability, and the remainder
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The portion of the net
proceeds we plan to use to strengthen our research and development capacity
includes US$       for purchasing equipment, US$       for expanding facilities,
US$       for additional hiring and US$       for tooling and sampling.
Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or acquire
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions as of the date of
this prospectus. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if
any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant
flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.


The market for optical transceivers for use in data communication applications
remains highly competitive. We anticipate that the market for our products will
continually evolve and will continue to experience rapid technological change,
evolving industry standards, shifting customer requirements and frequent product
introductions. We must continually design, develop and introduce new products
with improved features to be competitive. We believe the principal competitive
factors in these markets are:

• product performance, features, functionality and reliability;

• time-to-market of new product introductions;

• adoption of emerging industry standards;

• price/performance characteristics;

• comprehensive product portfolio;

• service and support; and

• access to customers.

Our principal competitors include Finisar, JDS Uniphase, Avago Technologies and
Sumitomo Electric, though we do not compete with any of these companies across
our full range of products. In addition to our current competitors, we may also
face competition at any time from established companies in related fields and
from newer startups in our own field. Many of our competitors and potential
competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, access
to larger customer bases, complementary product offerings, and significantly
greater financial, sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing,
distribution, technical and other resources than we do. Current and potential
competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic
relationships between themselves or with our existing or potential customers,
suppliers or other third parties. In addition, our customers could develop
products or technologies internally that would replace their need for our 
products and would become a source of competition.


Company Description
We are a leading infrastructure enabler of cloud data center networks. Our
optical transceivers connect computer servers by converting electrical signals
into optical signals for transmission over fiber optic cables. We focus on
optical transceivers that handle data transmission at high speeds


 within and
between cloud data centers, and our products have been adopted by some of the
largest data center operators in the United States. We are a leader in the
single mode 40G optical transceiver market, with a 37% global market share in
2014 based on revenue according to a research report we commissioned from
LightCounting LLC, an independent market research company. Forty gigabits per
second, or 40G, is currently the fastest commercially viable speed for data
center networks. By leveraging our proprietary expertise and know-how from
developing 40G products, we have developed new products for the cloud data
center 100G optical transceiver market, which is expected to exceed the 40G
market in terms of revenue by 2016, according to LightCounting.

The substantial growth in data traffic in recent years has been driven by the
proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices, the worldwide adoption of
high bandwidth mobile networking, the increase in rich media content and the
spread of internet-enabled devices. The demand for cloud data centers to handle
this traffic has been strong and is expected to continue to grow. Annual global
cloud IP traffic is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR,
of 32% per year from 2013 to 2018, according to the Cisco Global Cloud Index.
Global mobile data traffic is expected to grow at a CAGR of 57% per year from
2014 to 2019, according to the Cisco Visual Networking Index. In turn, strong
demand from the data center industry is expected to drive continued rapid growth
in the optical transceiver market, particularly for the high-performance optical
transceivers that we produce. Global sales volume for 40G or faster optical
transceivers for use in cloud data centers is expected to grow from US$376
million in 2014 to US$2,249 million in 2019, according to LightCounting,
representing a CAGR of 43%. Capital expenditure by companies whose primary
business is the creation, storage and dissemination of digital information such
as Google and Amazon doubled from US$23 billion in 2008 to US$46 billion in 2013
and is expected to grow to US$116 billion by 2019, according to Ovum Ltd., an
independent market research company, representing a six-year CAGR of 17%.

Our products include a comprehensive suite of 10G and 40G optical transceivers
as well as a growing number of leading-edge 100G products. We strategically
focus on developing high-performance optical transceivers for interconnections
within and between data centers, particularly single mode optical transceivers,
which are effective over longer distances than multi-mode ones. As data centers
become larger in scale to accommodate increasing traffic, data transmission
within the data center has to cover longer distances within given constraints on
power consumption and physical space, and we expect single mode technology will
become increasingly prevalent. We have shipped over three million units of
optical transceiver products since the founding of our company in 2008. We have
developed research and development targets and a product roadmap for a
comprehensive suite of leading-edge 100G products and are currently
transitioning our first generation of 100G products from development to
production. We design, develop and manufacture our products in-house, which
allows us to respond quickly to new opportunities in our rapidly evolving
market.

We have implemented a flexible sales strategy to serve a full range of
customers. We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our
channel partners. In the United States, we focus on sales directly to cloud data
center operators and system integrators, while in China we usually work with
system equipment manufacturers as well as system integrators. Cloud data center
operators have the greatest demand for high-performance optical transceivers and
require the most customization. Selling to them directly enables us to better
understand their needs and the direction in which the market is evolving, and 
thereby to meet their time-to-market requirements. Time-to-market is an
important competitive edge as product cycles shorten. In addition to the cloud
data center market, we are selectively penetrating the enterprise and telecom
carrier markets as these customers migrate to higher interconnection speeds and
as telecom companies in particular transition from traditional to cloud
computing. In 2014, our customers included Google and Arista in the United
States and ZTE and H3C in China.

We follow a selectively vertically integrated business model, under which we
perform the essential steps of product research, design, development and
manufacturing in-house while purchasing components from multiple suppliers. Our
research and development and our manufacturing facilities are located together
with our headquarters at the Suzhou Industrial Park, where we work in close
proximity to many key component suppliers, fiber optics cable companies and
research and development centers in our industry. We believe that concentrating
our facilities in one location within a robust optoelectronics ecosystem
facilitates collaboration, reduces development time, accelerates time-to-market
and enhances our ability to ramp up production quickly. As a China-based
company, we have been able to select from among some of the best candidates in
the massive and highly educated talent pool in China, and we have fostered
practices and expectations based on our Silicon Valley origins, including
encouraging innovation, supporting professional training initiatives and
promoting a less hierarchical corporate culture.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately US$         million, or approximately US$         million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses
payable by us. These estimates are based upon an assumed initial offering price
of US$         per ADS, the midpoint of the range shown on the front cover page
of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
ADSs by the selling shareholders. A US$1.00 change in the assumed initial public
offering price of US$         per ADS would, in the case of an increase,
increase and, in the case of a decrease, decrease the net proceeds of this
offering by US$         million, or approximately US$         million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, under
these assumptions.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We intend
to use US$         million to expand our 100G production capacity, US$        
million to strengthen our research and development capability, and the remainder
for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The portion of the net
proceeds we plan to use to strengthen our research and development capacity
includes US$       for purchasing equipment, US$       for expanding facilities,
US$       for additional hiring and US$       for tooling and sampling.
Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or acquire
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions as of the date of
this prospectus. The amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if
any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have significant
flexibility in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund its capital expenditures or working capital. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely
basis, if at all.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities.


The market for optical transceivers for use in data communication applications
remains highly competitive. We anticipate that the market for our products will
continually evolve and will continue to experience rapid technological change,
evolving industry standards, shifting customer requirements and frequent product
introductions. We must continually design, develop and introduce new products
with improved features to be competitive. We believe the principal competitive
factors in these markets are:

• product performance, features, functionality and reliability;

• time-to-market of new product introductions;

• adoption of emerging industry standards;

• price/performance characteristics;

• comprehensive product portfolio;

• service and support; and

• access to customers.

Our principal competitors include Finisar, JDS Uniphase, Avago Technologies and
Sumitomo Electric, though we do not compete with any of these companies across
our full range of products. In addition to our current competitors, we may also
face competition at any time from established companies in related fields and
from newer startups in our own field. Many of our competitors and potential
competitors have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, access
to larger customer bases, complementary product offerings, and significantly
greater financial, sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing,
distribution, technical and other resources than we do. Current and potential
competitors have established or may establish financial and strategic
relationships between themselves or with our existing or potential customers,
suppliers or other third parties. In addition, our customers could develop
products or technologies internally that would replace their need for our 
products and would become a source of competition.


Company Description
We are a leading infrastructure enabler of cloud data center networks. Our
optical transceivers connect computer servers by converting electrical signals
into optical signals for transmission over fiber optic cables. We focus on
optical transceivers that handle data transmission at high speeds


 within and
between cloud data centers, and our products have been adopted by some of the
largest data center operators in the United States. We are a leader in the
single mode 40G optical transceiver market, with a 37% global market share in
2014 based on revenue according to a research report we commissioned from
LightCounting LLC, an independent market research company. Forty gigabits per
second, or 40G, is currently the fastest commercially viable speed for data
center networks. By leveraging our proprietary expertise and know-how from
developing 40G products, we have developed new products for the cloud data
center 100G optical transceiver market, which is expected to exceed the 40G
market in terms of revenue by 2016, according to LightCounting.

The substantial growth in data traffic in recent years has been driven by the
proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices, the worldwide adoption of
high bandwidth mobile networking, the increase in rich media content and the
spread of internet-enabled devices. The demand for cloud data centers to handle
this traffic has been strong and is expected to continue to grow. Annual global
cloud IP traffic is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR,
of 32% per year from 2013 to 2018, according to the Cisco Global Cloud Index.
Global mobile data traffic is expected to grow at a CAGR of 57% per year from
2014 to 2019, according to the Cisco Visual Networking Index. In turn, strong
demand from the data center industry is expected to drive continued rapid growth
in the optical transceiver market, particularly for the high-performance optical
transceivers that we produce. Global sales volume for 40G or faster optical
transceivers for use in cloud data centers is expected to grow from US$376
million in 2014 to US$2,249 million in 2019, according to LightCounting,
representing a CAGR of 43%. Capital expenditure by companies whose primary
business is the creation, storage and dissemination of digital information such
as Google and Amazon doubled from US$23 billion in 2008 to US$46 billion in 2013
and is expected to grow to US$116 billion by 2019, according to Ovum Ltd., an
independent market research company, representing a six-year CAGR of 17%.

Our products include a comprehensive suite of 10G and 40G optical transceivers
as well as a growing number of leading-edge 100G products. We strategically
focus on developing high-performance optical transceivers for interconnections
within and between data centers, particularly single mode optical transceivers,
which are effective over longer distances than multi-mode ones. As data centers
become larger in scale to accommodate increasing traffic, data transmission
within the data center has to cover longer distances within given constraints on
power consumption and physical space, and we expect single mode technology will
become increasingly prevalent. We have shipped over three million units of
optical transceiver products since the founding of our company in 2008. We have
developed research and development targets and a product roadmap for a
comprehensive suite of leading-edge 100G products and are currently
transitioning our first generation of 100G products from development to
production. We design, develop and manufacture our products in-house, which
allows us to respond quickly to new opportunities in our rapidly evolving
market.

We have implemented a flexible sales strategy to serve a full range of
customers. We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our
channel partners. In the United States, we focus on sales directly to cloud data
center operators and system integrators, while in China we usually work with
system equipment manufacturers as well as system integrators. Cloud data center
operators have the greatest demand for high-performance optical transceivers and
require the most customization. Selling to them directly enables us to better
understand their needs and the direction in which the market is evolving, and 
thereby to meet their time-to-market requirements. Time-to-market is an
important competitive edge as product cycles shorten. In addition to the cloud
data center market, we are selectively penetrating the enterprise and telecom
carrier markets as these customers migrate to higher interconnection speeds and
as telecom companies in particular transition from traditional to cloud
computing. In 2014, our customers included Google and Arista in the United
States and ZTE and H3C in China.

We follow a selectively vertically integrated business model, under which we
perform the essential steps of product research, design, development and
manufacturing in-house while purchasing components from multiple suppliers. Our
research and development and our manufacturing facilities are located together
with our headquarters at the Suzhou Industrial Park, where we work in close
proximity to many key component suppliers, fiber optics cable companies and
research and development centers in our industry. We believe that concentrating
our facilities in one location within a robust optoelectronics ecosystem
facilitates collaboration, reduces development time, accelerates time-to-market
and enhances our ability to ramp up production quickly. As a China-based
company, we have been able to select from among some of the best candidates in
the massive and highly educated talent pool in China, and we have fostered
practices and expectations based on our Silicon Valley origins, including
encouraging innovation, supporting professional training initiatives and
promoting a less hierarchical corporate culture.
