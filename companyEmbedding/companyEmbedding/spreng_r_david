A NOTE ON METHODOLOGY: The Midas List seeks to identify individuals who deploy venture capital to create wealth for their investors. Our ranking formula ignores the original amount invested in a deal (as it is often undisclosed), instead weighing most heavily the market capitalization of a venture-backed company on the close of its first day of trading or the purchase price in an acquisition. A lesser weight is given to the change in value of each investment since going public or being sold. Ranking also depends on a venture capitalist's (or lawyer's, banker's or recruiter's) length of involvement and influence with a startup. Companies must have gone public or been acquired after June 1995 to be considered, and they must be engaged in information technology or life sciences. Our results are based on extensive reporting and surveys sent to 1,000 professionals, including VCs, angels, lawyers, bankers, recruiters and limited partners. Special thanks go to Thomson Financial Venture Economics/National Venture Capital Association, Alternative Investor/Private Equity Analyst/VentureOne. CONTRIBUTORS: Erika Brown, David Whelan, Michael K. Ozanian, Mitchel Rand, Carl Subick, Leslie Kippen, Anton Klusener, Charles Brucaliere.
