As the former President and CEO of the company, Mr. Spoerry has long-standing experience in the global precision instrument industry and a deep knowledge of the company, including its organization, products, markets, customers, and competitors. He has a strong technical background and experience with innovation-driven companies. Mr. Spoerry has broad international experience across industries and businesses relevant to the company, including by virtue of his service on several other boards of directors. 
Mr. Spoerry devotes a substantial amount of his time to his service as Chairman of the Board and other specific duties. His deep understanding of the company, its markets, customers, and competitors, which was developed over more than thirty years of service, is a unique and valuable qualification that we believe provides a substantial benefit to the company and its shareholders.
