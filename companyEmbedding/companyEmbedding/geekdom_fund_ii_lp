It is managed by Riverwalk Capital, LLC.   Visit Geekdom Fund II, LLP Website ›Targeted TechnologyThe Targeted Technology Funds are focused on early stage investments in companies that  we believe can advance ground breaking or disruptive technologies to significantly improve  the practice of medicine and patient outcomes. They favor technologies that can positively  improve the efficiency, cost, or functionality of the development and manufacture of life science  products and believe that their life science investment model is particularly suited to today’s  healthcare and economic environment. One that favors innovations that can improve clinical  outcomes and patient care, while at the same time reducing healthcare costs.  Visit Targeted Technology Website ›InCube LabsMulti-disciplinary life sciences R&D lab focused on developing breakthrough medical innovations.   Visit InCube Labs Website ›CardiovateCardiovate is a medical technology company that targets transformational health care opportunities in tissue regeneration and repair through the development of novel products that utilize proprietary materials and processes along with a deep understanding of clinical needs.

It is because of their experiences and their commitment to being helpful in everything they do, that HelpSocial exists today. The tools for the job of social customer care were lacking and they seeked out to develop a platform that could help them serve their customers in social media that went beyond features, functions, UI design, API, and scale the operation across an enterprise. The HelpSocial platform was developed in a live production environment while using it to serve customers at the same time. This allowed them to make great development decisions and has resulted in a workflow that exists specifically to solve the unique problems that got in the way of delivering support.Visit HelpSocial Website ›ParlevelParlevel is a full-featured vending software solution that delivers real-time visibility into vending and office coffee service operations.

Currently, we are in the later stages of developing our award-winning extracranial pressure relief technology designed to aid in the prevention of cranial deformations in newborns. The prevalence of plagiocephaly in the United States has increased from 5 percent of all newborns in the 1990s to between 20 percent and 30 percent at present. Additionally, plagiocephaly has been associated with heightened risk for developmental delays in infants and toddlers. Invictus Medical is dedicated to providing cutting-edge, innovative solutions for the unmet needs of newborns, their caregivers and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) professionals.  Our Vision: To improve the lives of newborns and the individuals who care for them.  Our Mission: To secure early healthy development in newborns by providing innovative products, services, and solutions to the healthcare professional and consumer markets.  Our Commitment to Quality: Invictus Medical is committed to providing safe and effective medical products and high levels of service to the healthcare and consumer markets.Visit Invictus Medical, Inc. Website ›OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc. (formerly OtoMetrix Medical Technologies, Inc.) is commercializing a ground-breaking, patented, Doppler ultrasound medical device to rapidly and accurately diagnose middle ear infections, called Otitis Media (OM), in children and adults. 17.6 Million patient visits each year are coded to OM at a cost of more than $5 Billion/year, yet clinical studies show a 50% error rate in diagnosis.   Otitis Media is the #1 reason for antibiotics prescriptions in children and the #1 cause for surgery in children. Current diagnostic methods are decades old and, critically, cannot distinguish the type of infection behind the tympanic membrane (eardrum). Our handheld device is designed to quickly and accurately detect both the presence and the type of fluid behind the eardrum in a second or less, providing, for the first time, objective, definitive diagnostic data, leading to increased accuracy, earlier and better treatment, reduced antibiotic use, and reduced healthcare costs.   Visit OtoNexus Medical Technologies, Inc.  Website ›Metric Medical Devices Inc.Metric Medical Devices, Inc.’s mission is to develop advanced orthopedic implant systems for musculoskeletal fixation. Metric develops, manufactures and is commercializing products to advance the standard of care in the treatment of disease and trauma. The orthopedic fracture and internal fixation market exceeds $2.6 billion annually for the foot and hand and is expected to exceed $4.6 billion annually by 2015 due to the growing related disorders of obesity, diabetes, and arthritis as well as the population’s increasing age and active lifestyle.Visit Metric Medical Devices Inc. Website ›StemBioSys, LLC.StemBioSys, LLC Inc., develops and licenses novel, proprietary stem cell technologies to meet the promise of regenerative medicine in a surging global market. The company's first manufactured product is XC-marrow ECM™Bone Marrow – High Performance MicroEnvironment™ (BM-HPME™) , a unique extracellular matrix which provides a native three-dimensional environment for rapid isolation and expansion of stem cells derived from various sources including bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood and umbilical cord tissue. Compared with culture media currently in use, cells cultured on this next-generation ECM grow 7 to 10 times faster and maintain their stem cell qualities ("stemness") in unprecedented fashion.StemBioSys is focused on final process development activities for our patented core technology, BM-HPME™ and scale up of our cGMP facility with partner BioBridge Global. We are also beginning to explore business relationships with potential partners for other, next generation, product offerings from this versatile platform technology.StemBioSys technology also isolates and expands large and hitherto unrecognized quantities of pluri-potent, embryonic-like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human umbilical cord blood. Such cells can advance future stem cell applications in regenerating human tissues including nerve, muscle, skin, bone, adipose, cartilage, glandular cells and blood vessels.Visit StemBioSys, LLC.

Local investors have rustled up millions in a new venture capital pool slated for early stage technology startups in the San Antonio metro area — more than $6.6 million among 35 investors, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Geekdom Fund II LP is seeking to sell an additional $8.3 million of equity to invest in technology startup companies for a round totaling $15 million, records show.

Each accredited investor pitched in at least $100,000 to participate in the round.




Despite the similar moniker, it is not controlled by Geekdom LC, the collaborative co-working space downtown, but rather co-managed by a group of individuals active in the local technology industry. A similarly named Geekdom Fund that sprouted up a few years ago was a different legal entity.
Michael Girdley is chairman of the board at Alamo Fireworks and Codeup LLC, a local retailer and computer coding career school in San Antonio.
Don Douglas is CEO at Liquid Networx, a local information technology services company and founding partner at 186k Ventures, another early stage fund in San Antonio.
Michael Troy is CEO of FlashScan3D, a local biometrics company that is developing technology that scans fingers and hands without touching the surface of a device. He is also a former IBM consultant.
Cole Wollack is an engineer at FlashScan 3D and co-manager of the venture capital fund. Wollack works on deal flow, due diligence and administrative duties for Geekdom Fund.




 


In 2014, about $2.9 million of equity was raised by Geekdom Fund I LP among 47 investors through Riverwalk Capital LLC. In 2015, Geekdom Fund I had raised nearly $3.4 million total, split among 54 investors.
Geekdom Fund has invested in several San Antonio companies like Merge Labs Inc., the creators of Merge VR, a virtual reality headset and Parlevel Systems Inc. a vending machine technology startup.

About two years ago, a local venture capital pool called Geekdom Fund was created in an effort to invest in technology companies. Since then, the organization has raised two funds — Geekdom Fund I LP and Geekdom Fund II LP with $3.4 million and $6.6 million, respectively.
The first fund has investments in nearly two dozen technology businesses spanning from San Antonio to Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, Geekdom Fund II LP is looking to raise an additional $8.3 million in equity — for a round totaling $15 million — to invest in technology startup companies, records show, though it was not immediately clear whether the fund is fully committed or not.

A peek at the investment portfolio of Geekdom Fund I shows mostly software technology startups — nearly all of which are graduates of Techstars, an accelerator program with campuses around the world.





Here is a snapshot of the San Antonio-based companies Geekdom Fund I invested in:
SeatSmart, a web portal that sells tickets to events as a third-party broker, was co-founded by Brett and Jerome Cohen. True Ability, an information technology industry certification tool startup, was co-founded by former Rackspace Hosting Inc. employees Frederick Mendler, Marcus Robertson and Dusty Jones. The startup is an alumni of Techstars. Parlevel Systems Inc. is a vending machine industry startup that builds hardware and software products, like a self-checkout system for fresh food markets. It was co-founded by Rafael Barroso, Alfonso Garcia and Luis Pablo Gonzalez. The startup is also an alumni of Techstars. HelpSocial Inc., a next generation customer service tool using social media, was co-founded by former Rackspace employees Matt Wilbanks and Robert Collazo — alumni of Techstars. Promoter.io, an email marketing and customer feedback technology startup, was founded by former Rackspace employees Chad Keck and Ricardo Reyna, also Techstars graduates. Merge Labs Inc., which makes a foam virtual reality headset for smartphones, was co-founded in 2013 by Andrew Trickett and Franklin Lyons. Virtkick, a cloud website and database management tool, was co-founded by Polish entrepreneurs Mirek Wozniak and Damian Nowak who moved to San Antonio after finishing the Techstars program. MedSpoke, a tool that connects emergency room doctors with open shifts at hospitals, was co-founded by Jon Larson and Rick Morris.

Among those startups in the Alamo City, Geekdom Fund I invested roughly $860,000 since 2014, with an average investment of $100,000, according to information included in a presentation for investors obtained by the Business Journal.
Geekdom Fund's management declined comment on most of the San Antonio Business Journal's questions about the fund's rate of return for investors and portfolio companies.




 


But the information in the investor presentation shows that some of the Geekdom Fund's portfolio companies have flourished. Parlevel Systems, for example, has seen its valuation rise from $2.6 million when Geekdom Fund invested in the startup to a recent valuation of about $13 million, according to the presentation for investors.
Austin-based startups that were supported through the Geekdom Fund I pool:
Tenfold is a sales team performance tool and Techstars graduate. Fashion Metric is an algorithm-driven tool for tailoring menswear and Techstars alum. BitFusion is a software tool that aims to accelerate research and applications for scientists and Techstars alum. Patient IO is a software tool that connects patients with medical professionals through a web portal, which was acquired by Aetna Inc. in November. It was a startup graduate of Techstars. Waldo Photos is a crowdsourced photo marketplace startup that uses facial recognition. It was co-founded by Rodney Rice and Michael Beaudoin. Smart Picture Technologies is a mobile phone software developer whose product takes two-dimensional images and turns it into 3-D photos. It was founded by Kari Myllykoski. Klever Logic Inc. is a software and hardware company that built Flash Valet, a parking system for valet companies. One Model is a data analytics tool for human resources and Techstars graduate.
Beyond Texas, here are the technology startups that Geekdom Fund I invested in:
FileThis is a San Francisco-area bill reminder dashboard startup. Puracath Medical is a San Francisco-area medical device for home dialysis therapy startup. Testlio is a mobile app testing startup with offices in San Francisco and Estonia. It went through the Techstars program. Heroik Labs Inc., doing business as Worklife, was a San Francisco-based business team collaboration tool that was acquired by Cisco in October. Benchmade Modern is a custom furniture startup that's a hybrid brick-and-mortar store and website based in San Francisco. Stabilitas is a safety alert tool for travelers based in Seattle that went through Techstars. MetricStory is an artificial intelligence-fueled data tool for businesses based in Seattle that went through Techstars. StyleSage is a New York-based fashion analytics startup that graduated from Techstars.
For Geekdom Fund II, the investors plan to invest $25,000 to $500,000 per startup, according to the presentation for investors.
Going forward, however, the Geekdom Fund will not have a Techstars Cloud program in San Antonio as a source to draw from for its portfolio as the national Techstars organization recently decided to cease operating its Alamo City incarnation.
Investing in Techstars companies can reduce risk, given the deep level of screening that goes into selecting each class. The acceptance rate for technology startups to a Techstars cohort, a three-month mentorship business accelerator, is less than 1 percent. For the former Techstars Cloud program in San Antonio, about 1,000 startups applied for about a dozen slots.
But there are stirrings of other business accelerators in San Antonio that might fill the gap.
