About the Kirby Company

Kirby vacuums and Kirby parts are held to a higher standard  by the company itself. By labeling its products luxury vacuums, Kirby makes higher-end cleaners that are highly versatile. The current Kirby vacuum model, the Kirby Sentria, can be used to perform an array of tasks, for example, acting as an upright, a canister, a carpet cleaner, and a floor buffer. Kirby prides itself on the versatility of having one machine for all your floor care needs. 
When Kirby originated in 1906, Jim Kirby invented his first masterpiece: a Kirby vacuum called the Domestic Cyclone. 


		Kirby created vacuums for the Scott & Fetzer Machine Company, including the Vac-u-ette Electric, the predecessor to the Kirby multi-use units like the Sentria.  Much like most companies in the early 1900s, Kirby vacuums were sold via door-to-door salesmen who implemented in-home demonstrations of the multi-use machines. However, unlike most companies today, Kirby vacuums are still only sold directly to consumers through independent door-to-door retailers around the nation. 
By building off the original design of the Vac-u-ette Electric vacuum, the company has constantly improved its vacuum systems by adding more bells and whistles. 


Each generation of Kirby vacuums focused on rolling all floor care needs into a single machine, with high-quality items for better functionality. These premium attachments, such as LED lights located on the base of the vacuum to better clean in dark areas, add to the luxury appeal of the Kirby vacuum. More so, by using certified HEPA air filters in the systems, Kirby vacuums are better able to remove allergens from the home, enabling enhanced breathing for its consumers. 
As the Kirby vacuum systems are designed to last decades using die-cast aluminum for the base, it is not likely that consumers will need to buy a new Kirby vacuum. 


With the design structured to outlast many other brands of vacuums, all the consumer need do is replace Kirby vacuum cleaner parts from time to time. This is where PartsWarehouse.com has you covered  for all your Kirby parts in one place.

5.0 out of 5 stars40th Birthday GiftByAmazon Customeron March 19, 2013This was a 40th birthday gift for my daughter who had this record as a child. She loves this CD and was glad that it was recorded in CD form because she no longer has a record player. She plays it in her car almost everyday, and in her home on weekends. Her favorite songs are "The Greatest Band" and "Watch Out for Goofy." My daughter is so happy to have this childhood favorite and can't wait to share it with her one year old grandson. This brought back such fond memories of watching my daughter dance and sing to this recording when she was a child. We are still looking in the attic for the original and her old record player. My daughter and I both highly recommend this CD. I thought it was pricey, but when I saw the heard the happiness and joy in my daughter's voice when she received her birthday gift, I can truly say it is Priceless, and worth every dollar. The recording was as featured on Amazon, and it was shipped immediately and received in two days. Can't thank you enough Amazon for featuring this CD.

Smookon July 12, 2010Format: Audio CD|Verified PurchaseI remembered this record from when my son was about 5, back in 1980 or so.  We had this LP record and I used it to play "musical pillows" (musical chairs using pillows made it safer and more fun) at his birthday party.  I know the boys had so much fun dancing to the songs during the game and we played it several times.  So I wanted to find it for my grandchildren (and nostalgia for myself and my son!)  My 4 year old grandson claimed it as his own and will not let it out of his sight!  He takes it everywhere and his pre-school teachers play it there for the kids too.  It was well worth the money and a new generation now has received the treat!  I loved it then and I love it now!  It continues to spread happiness to children!Happy Grandma0Comment|

Our kids were just 3,5,7 when we had a record of this music.  they would play it and dance around the house till they dropped.  It was so scratched up that we had to retire it.  Our daughter wanted to use it for her pre-school.  We got the tape for posterity.0Comment|

About the Kirby Company

Kirby vacuums and Kirby parts are held to a higher standard  by the company itself. By labeling its products luxury vacuums, Kirby makes higher-end cleaners that are highly versatile. The current Kirby vacuum model, the Kirby Sentria, can be used to perform an array of tasks, for example, acting as an upright, a canister, a carpet cleaner, and a floor buffer. Kirby prides itself on the versatility of having one machine for all your floor care needs. 
When Kirby originated in 1906, Jim Kirby invented his first masterpiece: a Kirby vacuum called the Domestic Cyclone. 


		Kirby created vacuums for the Scott & Fetzer Machine Company, including the Vac-u-ette Electric, the predecessor to the Kirby multi-use units like the Sentria.  Much like most companies in the early 1900s, Kirby vacuums were sold via door-to-door salesmen who implemented in-home demonstrations of the multi-use machines. However, unlike most companies today, Kirby vacuums are still only sold directly to consumers through independent door-to-door retailers around the nation. 
By building off the original design of the Vac-u-ette Electric vacuum, the company has constantly improved its vacuum systems by adding more bells and whistles. 


Each generation of Kirby vacuums focused on rolling all floor care needs into a single machine, with high-quality items for better functionality. These premium attachments, such as LED lights located on the base of the vacuum to better clean in dark areas, add to the luxury appeal of the Kirby vacuum. More so, by using certified HEPA air filters in the systems, Kirby vacuums are better able to remove allergens from the home, enabling enhanced breathing for its consumers. 
As the Kirby vacuum systems are designed to last decades using die-cast aluminum for the base, it is not likely that consumers will need to buy a new Kirby vacuum. 


With the design structured to outlast many other brands of vacuums, all the consumer need do is replace Kirby vacuum cleaner parts from time to time. This is where PartsWarehouse.com has you covered  for all your Kirby parts in one place.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
