Photo by @CristinaMittermeier // On Assignment for @NatGeo with @PaulNicklen.

Bathing the northern fjords of Norway in molten gold, the sun peeks over the horizon for the first time after the long, dark winter.  January 19 is the first day when the sun returns and although it only lasts a few minutes, evert second is a magical mix of sunrise and sunset, made more special by the company of orcas.

A few seconds after I made this photograph of a female orca surfacing into the light, the sun set again, casting the cold shadow of winter on everything around us.  To get a glimpse of what orcas look like underwater, in the dead of winter, #follow my #instragram account @CristinaMittermeier.

#Regram from #MACSeniorArtist @Ashley_Rudder.
#MACArtistChallenge #MyArtistCommunity 126 26,270She had me at - I want to write a movie script that shows a raw, human side of you the world has never seen.

A pleasure to sit for hours with the creator of POWER and prolific writer, @courtneyakemp. 
I was impressed at the deep dived research she did on my life and career before our meeting. She writes brilliantly flawed, edgy, exposed, vulnerable, intense characters and she had a take on my life in ways no writer ever has. 
A fascinating POV from this woman, on what makes me the man I am today. 
This is the first step of many and projects like this take time. Great initial meeting and can't wait to dig in with her.
