Jul 08, 2011, 16:21 ET
		  		  								
						 from   Entergy Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


BATON ROUGE, La., July 8, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Louisiana, LLC ("ELL"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation (NYSE:   ETR), announced today that it plans to sell approximately $206,000,000 principal amount of Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding I, L.L.C., Senior Secured Investment Recovery Bonds in an underwritten public offering. All of the investment recovery bonds will be offered in a registered offering under a shelf registration statement filed jointly with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 24, 2011, by ELL and Entergy Louisiana Investment Recovery Funding I, L.L.C. 
ELL will use the net proceeds as a reimbursement for previously-incurred investment recovery costs.
ELL anticipates that the investment recovery bonds will be offered late in July or during August 2011 after the registration statement has become effective. 
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any state. The offering may be made only by means of a prospectus and related prospectus supplement. 
In this news release, and from time to time, Entergy Louisiana, LLC makes certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Except to the extent required by the federal securities laws, Entergy Louisiana, LLC undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.
Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. There are factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, including (a) those factors discussed in: (i) Entergy Corporation's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, (ii) Entergy Corporation's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, and (iii) Entergy Corporation's other reports and filings made under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (b) uncertainties associated with rate proceedings, formula rate plans and other cost recovery mechanisms; (c) uncertainties associated with efforts to remediate the effects of major storms and recover related restoration costs; (d) nuclear plant relicensing, operating and regulatory risks, including any changes resulting from the nuclear crisis in Japan following its catastrophic earthquake and tsunami; (e) legislative and regulatory actions; and (f) conditions in commodity and capital markets during the periods covered by the forward-looking statements, in addition to other factors described elsewhere in this news release and in subsequent securities filings.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

For the full year, the company realized a loss of 99 cents per share on an as-reported basis and operational EPS of $6.00 per share. The as-reported loss resulted from asset impairments in the third and fourth quarters reflecting the effects of strategic decisions in the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to reduce the company’s exposure to volatile and poorly structured wholesale power markets.“In 2015, we successfully worked through an extensive to-do list aimed at laying the foundation for steady and predictable Utility, Parent & Other earnings growth and improving certainty in our merchant generation business. Some of these actions, while necessary, were difficult for our stakeholders and impacted our as-reported financial results for the year,” said Entergy chairman and chief executive officer Leo Denault. “On an operational basis, our final 2015 results are in line with the expectations we shared with you last fall. We are also initiating 2016 guidance indicating strong Utility growth in large part due to the strategic accomplishments of last year, again consistent with indications on Utility, Parent & Other growth since the middle of last year and the ranges we gave at our last Analyst Day in 2014.”


                                The following information was filed by ENTERGY LOUISIANA INVESTMENT RECOVERY FUNDING I, L.L.C. on Thursday, February 18, 2016 as an 8K 2.02 statement, which is a press release pertaining to results of operations and financial condition.
