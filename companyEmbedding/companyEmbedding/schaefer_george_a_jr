      Address: Fifth Third Bancorp, 38 Fountain Square Plaza, Cincinnati, Ohio
      45263; http://www.53.com.
    

      ■ George A. Schaefer Jr., the chief executive officer at the
      Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, was once described as a
      "numbers-crunching, penny-pinching workaholic" (
      
        Insitutional Investor
      
      , July 2001). Schaefer drifted into the banking business by mere chance,
      bearing an unrelated military and engineering background. While Fifth
      Third had already possessed a hard-working, everybody-sells-all-the-time,
      frugal corporate culture when he took the helm in 1990, Schaefer added his
      engineer's love of gathering data and measuring everything as well
      as an aggressive leadership style to the mix; he once compared banking to
      guerrilla warfare. For many people, under Schaefer's leadership
      Fifth Third was not an easy place to work; type A people who thrived in
      meritocracies, on the other hand, were quite at home. Over the span of
      Schaefer's tenure Fifth Third's assets increased from $8
      billion to more than $91 billion. Fifth Third had not even been the
      largest bank in Cincinnati when he took over, but 15 years later it ranked
      among the 15 largest bank-holding companies in the United States in terms
      of assets and among the top 10 in market capitalization.
    

      WORKING-CLASS ROOTS
    

      Schaefer was born in 1946 in the working-class community of West
      Cincinnati. With five brothers and sisters he developed an extremely
      competitive personality, which he nurtured by playing high-school
      football. It was Schaefer's football coach who gave him an
      application to West Point during his senior year. Schaefer recalled that
      his coach had said, "Mr. Schaefer, I think you're the only
      person on this team who can read. Why don't you fill this out and
      send it in" (
      
        American Banker
      
      , March 23, 2001). Because he lacked the money to attend a strictly
      academic university—rather than because he possessed an
      overabundant sense of patriotism—Schaefer applied to West Point; he
      was accepted.
    

      Regardless of his motivation Schaefer came to appreciate the discipline
      instilled by the academy in its cadets. After graduating in 1967 with a
      degree in engineering, he attended the U.S. Army's elite Ranger
      School in Fort Benning, Georgia. Schaefer then spent two years in Germany
      serving with a nuclear-demolition munitions team. During the height of the
      Cold War his unit was assigned to destroy roads and bridges using small
      nuclear bombs in the case of an attack launched by the Soviets—a
      task that brought perspective years later to the pressures of running a
      bank.
    

      Schaefer completed his commitment to the Army by going to Vietnam for two
      years during the war. While supervising a 280-man crew constructing a
      strategically important highway, he learned how to perform under pressure
      and gained lessons about leadership that would influence his business
      career. In a profile in 
      
        Insitutional Investor
      
      , he explained, "If you take good care of your people, whether
      they're soldiers in Vietnam or bankers selling checking accounts in
      Chicago, then they'll do a marvelous job for you" (July
      2001). The highway construction was dangerous work, with his crew always
      in jeopardy of being shot at by the enemy as well as mistakenly by fellow
      Americans. For his service Schaefer was awarded a Bronze Star for valor.
    

      HIRING FREEZE AT NUCLEAR PLANT LEADS TO BANKING CAREER
    

      Schaefer had no interest in remaining in the army beyond his West Point
      commitment; in 1971 he returned home to
       Cincinnati. He applied for an engineering job at the nearby Zimmer
      Nuclear Power plant, which was being built by Cincinnati Gas and Electric,
      but as a result of a delay in the issuing of the plant's license a
      hiring freeze was imposed. With no other engineering positions available
      in the area, Schaefer decided to become a management trainee at Fifth
      Third for a salary of $8,500 a year.
    

      Fifth Third's origins could be traced to the 1858 opening of the
      Bank of the Ohio Valley in Cincinnati. That institution was purchased in
      1871 by Third National Bank, which merged in 1908 with Fifth National
      Bank, forming the Fifth Third National Bank of Cincinnati. Fifth Third
      Bancorp was formed as a holding company in 1975. When Schaefer joined
      Fifth Third it was headed by William S. Rowe, the fourthgeneration
      Cincinnati banker who over his 42-year tenure infused the bank with a
      frugal, conservative approach. According to Schaefer, "He
      wouldn't spend a nickel to see an earthquake" (
      
        American Banker
      
      , March 14, 1994). Rowe's successor Clement L. Buenger, who took
      over in 1979, had a background in the grocery and insurance industries and
      brought the perspective gained from a sales culture to Fifth Third, with
      an emphasis on hard work. Both men's strengths would inform
      Schaefer's approach to business, as the trained engineer turned
      accidental banker worked his way up through the organization.
    

      Taking the advice of a brother-in-law who worked at the Federal Reserve in
      Cincinnati, Schaefer at first asked to be assigned to the commercial-loan
      department. He would later find a better use for his superior mathematical
      skills in taking over the bank's data-processing operation. In the
      mid-1970s Fifth Third became involved in the credit-card business,
      initially relying on Bank One to do the necessary processing work. When
      Fifth Third decided to do processing in-house, management discovered that
      the company lacked both the necessary computer power and programming
      personnel. During the operation's overhaul Schaefer was put in
      charge of the data-processing unit, Midwest Payments Systems. That
      business would eventually become a profit center for Fifth Third through
      the processing of credit-card and ATM transactions for other companies.
      Schaefer's strong performance in his new role caught the attention
      of the bank's upper management and directors.
    

      NIGHT-SCHOOL MBA
    

      To help advance his career, Schaefer went to night school, earning an MBA
      from Xavier University. After several years heading Midwest Payments, in
      1979 Schaefer returned to the commercial-loan department; three years
      later he was named the department's senior vice president. In 1982,
      when he was just 36 years old, Schaefer had his first heart-bypass
      operation—a routine follow-up operation would be conducted in
      1997—but health concerns did little to delay his advancement at
      Fifth Third. In 1984 Schaefer became the head of commercial lending and
      executive vice president. The next major step in his career came in 1989
      when he was appointed president and chief operating officer. When Buenger
      retired on January 1, 1991, Schaefer became Fifth Third's new CEO.
    

      Schaefer took over a well-established institution with a strong corporate
      culture. In the words of 
      
        American Banker
      
      , "His challenge was to fill the big shoes of Clement Buenger, who
      10 years ago took over a profitable, penny-pinching, conservative bank and
      turned it into a very profitable, penny-pinching, conservative
      bank" (July 19, 1991). At Fifth Third everyone was a salesperson;
      employees from any number of departments made calls to attract business.
      Tellers were paid $10 if they convinced a customer to apply for a Fifth
      Third credit card. Another legacy from Buenger was the bank's early
      move into supermarket locations, which provided a convenient venue through
      which to do business with a wider range of customers.
    

      In keeping with Fifth Third's cult of salesmanship, one of
      Schaefer's first acts as CEO was to lead 20 employees on a
      door-to-door sales campaign to drum up new business for the bank. The one
      who knocked on the most doors was awarded a $200 pair of Allan Edmond
      shoes. Such luxuries, while suitable as sales incentives, were not common
      at Fifth Third, which was known for its thriftiness. The bank's
      headquarters made do with 20-year-old carpeting, executives flew coach,
      business lunches were a rarity, and Midwest Payment relied on two
      second-hand IBM mainframe computers to conduct business. Schaefer took
      penny-pinching at the bank to the next level, disposing of the few cars
      owned by the bank for company use. From that point on even Schaefer drove
      his own car on local business and was reimbursed for mileage.
    

      Schaefer's obsession with cost controls resulted in strong profits.
      While banks spent on average about 65 cents for every revenue dollar,
      Fifth Third spent just 50 cents. For their hard work and incessant
      selling, Fifth Third employees were rewarded with a generous share of the
      profits. Schaefer had assumed control of an institution that was
      conservative on other levels as well: at the senior ranks Fifth Third was
      an all-male club, and Buenger was known to send female employees home to
      change if he deemed their attire inappropriate.
    

      Overall, Schaefer inherited a bank that was well run and one of the best
      performers in the industry. He readily admitted that he had no overarching
      strategy and that his strength lay in the day-to-day execution of his job.
      If anything, his vision was to do the same as his
      predecessor—sell—simply to a greater extent. He proved
      relentless in riding herd on his employees. One of his first actions was
      to light a fire under the trust business, which had failed to measure up
      to his expectations. As an engineer number cruncher, Schaefer eventually
      took advantage
       of Fifth Third's management-information system to keep tabs on all
      of the company's major profit centers, ensuring that all employees
      were kept abreast of who the "winners" and
      "losers" were. Schaefer was not known to lose his temper or
      try to intimidate anyone; he simply let statistics pit executives and
      their groups against one another. Peer pressure to avoid landing on the
      bottom of one of Schaefer's well-circulated lists was more than
      enough motivation for his employees; if they lacked driven, type A
      personalities, they generally didn't stick around very long.
    

      A DECADE OF CONSERVATIVE EXPANSION
    

      Schaefer was both ambitious and conservative as he expanded Fifth Third
      one safe step at a time. In his first two years he completed several small
      acquisitions, then in 1992 attempted a bolder move, making an unsolicited
      takeover bid for Star Banc Corporation, Fifth Third's chief
      competitor in Cincinnati. When the offer was rejected by Star's
      board, Schaefer backed off; somewhat humbled, he returned to his more
      cautious approach to expansion. Over the course of 10 years Schaefer
      oversaw the acquisition of more than 50 small banks, thrifts, and branch
      purchases—mostly institutions with assets in the $500 million
      range. But as Fifth Third grew larger, so did its capacity to make sizable
      deals, and Schaefer did not shy away from the challenge. The bank made a
      pivotal move in 1999 when it completed the $2.4 billion purchase of the
      Evansville, Indiana–based CNB Bancshares, which placed Fifth Third
      on the edge of the coveted Chicago market.
    

      As the 1990s came to a close, Schaefer was managing an enterprise that
      ranked among America's top 25 banks, boasting more than $38 billion
      in assets. Its core branch network was located in the three states of
      Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana and was supplemented by operations in other
      states, especially Florida. But with the company's increases in
      size came complications. To avoid the risk of spreading Fifth Third too
      thin, Schaefer looked for in-market acquisitions. The dramatic increase in
      the number of employees threatened to dilute the company's
      cherished culture; to address that issue, he expanded the bank's
      educational programs: new training facilities were opened, teams from the
      benefits department made more visits to employees of acquired operations,
      and a weekly newsletter was created to keep the much larger workforce
      informed.
    

      To manage Fifth Third's expanding banking enterprise, Schaefer
      created what one management consultant described as a "model of
      supercommunity banking" (
      
        Insitutional Investor
      
      , July 2001). In essence he established a management structure that broke
      acquisitions into smaller pieces, creating confederations of regional
      affiliates, each with a great deal of local decision-making power. Field
      officers were charged with serving customers according to their needs,
      while the home office set performance goals and provided administrative,
      marketing, and product support. Schaefer tried to put his own people in
      charge wherever possible.
    

      Employees at new acquisitions were quickly inculcated with Fifth
      Third's culture, although the assimilation was not always
      successful. A case in point was Schaefer's attempt to break into
      the securities industry: In 1998 Fifth Third acquired the Columbus-based
      Ohio Company, a regional brokerage firm. According to an 
      
        American Banker
      
       article, "a significant number of brokers reportedly left out of
      dissatisfaction with the buyer's operating style, and some took a
      lot of client assets with them" (March 23, 2001). This case was an
      exception, however, over Schaefer's first 10 years at the helm of
      Fifth Third.
    

      GAMBLES ON OLD KENT ACQUISITION
    

      Schaefer displayed a gambling side to his personality in November 2000
      when—in the midst of an economic downturn—he agreed to pay
      $5.5 billion for Old Kent Financial Corporation of Grand Rapids, Michigan.
      The deal was more than twice the size of the CNB acquisition and was a key
      addition because it provided Fifth Third with direct entry into the
      lucrative Chicago market as well as other parts of Illinois and Michigan.
      The addition of Old Kent brought the value of Fifth Third's assets
      to $69 billion, and with $44 billion in deposits and one thousand banking
      locations Fifth Third was now one of the five largest banks in the
      five-state area of Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio.
    

      The acquisition did not come without problems, however. Schaefer announced
      that a large number of Old Kent's seven thousand employees would be
      laid off, which made the task of persuading the remaining employees to buy
      into Fifth Third's culture, which was not geared toward people
      adverse to meritocracy, a difficult one. As he had done with previous
      acquisitions, Schaefer reorganized Old Kent, forming three affiliate
      banks, two of which (including one in the all-important Chicago market)
      would be headed by trustworthy Fifth Third executives. Schaefer hoped to
      break up Old Kent's culture, allowing him to more easily convert
      employees to the Fifth Third way of conducting business.
    

      LOOKING FOR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
    

      After Old Kent, Schaefer continued to look for opportunities to spur Fifth
      Third's growth by way of acquisitions; yet he reverted to a more
      cautious approach, looking for deals which would merely provide toeholds
      in new markets. From there the bank could employ a technique that it had
      used successfully in the past: expanding outward and building market
      share. New markets that Schaefer considered opportunistic existed in the
      St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Milwaukee areas; he was also interested in the
      cities of Charleston, West Virginia, and
       Knoxville, Tennessee. In 2002 Fifth Third agreed to acquire the
      Tennessee-based Franklin Financial Corporation, a bank with $954 million
      in assets. However, the $240 million deal was held up because of concerns
      on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Ohio Department
      of Commerce's Division of Financial Institutions in light of the
      bank's September 2002 admission to the Securities and Exchange
      Commission that it was unable to account for $54 million worth of internal
      investment funds. The matter hung over Fifth Third for the next 18 months,
      delaying the Franklin Financial acquisition and tarnishing to a certain
      extent the reputations of both Schaefer and Fifth Third.
    

      When regulatory concerns were finally resolved, Schaefer was able to
      continue his quest to spur Fifth Third's growth. He maintained that
      he planned to retire before he turned 65, a decision he said was unrelated
      to his previous heart problems; yet as long as he was in charge at Fifth
      Third, it remained likely that he would continue to expand the
      bank's operations, by and large opting for the conservative route
      but occasionally exhibiting a willingness to take chances. He told 
      
        Forbes
      
      , "This business is like playing poker. You have to ante up or get
      out of the game" (January 8, 2001).
