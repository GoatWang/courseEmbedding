 Spec Sheet
    



The iMow MI 632 P cuts the lawn automatically and according to requirements. The mowing time is conveniently programmed using the control panel. Using the rotary knob, you can simply adjust the cutting height in 15 levels from 20 to 60 mm. Everything else is done by the iMow. Fast, intelligent and efficient. And extremely practical - during mowing, the clippings are shredded finely and returned to the soil as nutrients. Leave the lawn care to the iMow and spend your free time doing all of the things you enjoy. For more information contact your local approved iMow dealer.

Features
                






Standard








Mulching mower - for a greener lawn
During mowing, the iMow shreds the grass clippings finely, which then fall back onto the lawn acting as a effective fertiliser (known as mulching). Not only does this provide vital nourishment to help grow a thick and healthy lawn, it also means there are no grass clippings to collect and dispose of. Every time the blade stops the rotation direction changes automatically, thus ensuring even wear. If the blade needs to be replaced, this can be done simply and without tools.









Offset drive home feature
By default, the robotic mower travels back home to the docking station along the perimeter wire. If required, and depending on the edge of the mowing area, you can also set the mower to travel at an offset of 0.3 to 0.7 m to the perimeter wire. Please take into account any necessary additional installation accessories when laying corridors (e.g.: wiring set AED 600)









Bright LCD display
Not only can all the necessary settings be entered intuitively via the screen, thanks to its high-contrast, bright display, it can also be used in bright sunlight. On the MI 6 models, the display can also be removed as a console to facilitate programming without having to bend down.









Removable control panel
The control panel with strong light LCD display can be removed from the device. You don't have to stoop to programme your device and can also control it manually.









Docking station
If it rains or the battery runs low, the robotic mower returns itself to the docking station and recharges automatically. With its intelligent charging system, the robot mower decides whether a quick charge is needed to complete a scheduled mowing plan, or whether the battery can be charged in a slower mode.









Movable hood
The hood of the iMow robotic mower is movable and features sensors for detecting obstacles. If the machine bumps against an obstacle, the impact forces are deflected along the hood and the robotic mower immediately changes direction. If the hood is lifted, the blades stop.









Standard equipment
1 machine (incl. AAI 201 and blade), 1 docking Station (incl. 4 pegs for securing to the ground), 1 iRuler (tool for laying of the perimeter wire)









Integrated theft protection
For extra security you can program iMow to lock itself and sound an alarm if it is physically removed from the mowing area.









Wheels with traction tread
The traction thread on the wheels allow the iMow to mow areas with denser grass, uneven terrain and gentle slopes. Not only are the profile wheels smooth running, but also self-cleaning.












Accessories
                












AIP 600 iProtect canopy for docking station


        In sunny conditions, the canopy provides an effective sunscreen protecting the iMow against direct sunlight extending its service life.

The family business is now run by Charles and his son Graham, along with a team of dedicated employees who are all long serving and experienced in their departments. The timber business, founded by Charles’ father Rowland in 1922 is where Charles gained his long-  standing practical experience of chainsaws and the timber trade. As chainsaws were first introduced, he could see their huge potential and  eventually sold his first Stihl chainsaw in 1964. Charles H Hill Ltd has grown from that day and is now a well-established and well-known firm in  Lincolnshire. The timber business, R H Hill & Son continues to operate, producing quality firewood.
 Fifty years of quality
It’s now fifty years since Charles Hill sold his first Stihl chainsaw to Norman Leggate of Tattershall Thorpe. The  original chainsaw was purchased for just £62 12 / 6d. Fifty years later and the Leggate family still have a great  working relationship with the Hills. In the 1960s, the West German company of Andreas Stihl only made two  models of chainsaw.  As the range of Stihl products rapidly increased over the years, the business grew, taking  on all the new quality products as they were introduced and also carrying the huge stocks of spare parts required to maintain the backbone of the business, which of course, is after sales service.
 Stihl quality 
Andreas Stihl Ltd now manufactures a huge range of quality forestry and garden machinery, for both domestic and Professional use, together with all the accessories and safety equipment that complements the range. The 2014 price list now consists of 250 pages, including chainsaws,
polesaws, brush cutters, strimmers, hedge trimmers (including long reach), posthole borers, garden blow vacs, pressure washers and vacuums.  Virtually the entire range is carried in stock at Horsington and all sold at competitive prices. The company also stocks the Viking range which is  part of the Stihl Group, which also includes the new iMow robotic mower.
 The Honda franchise
When Charles H Hill Ltd decided to expand its range into lawnmowers and generators, the Honda franchise was the obvious choice as Honda’s reputation for reliability and quality was already legendary. The Honda product range has also grown rapidly over the years and Charles H Hill Ltd now sells and stocks virtually all the Honda Power Product Range, which includes ride-on mowers, lawnmowers, handy and industrial generators, water pumps, engines and rotavators. Most Honda Mowers and ride-ons now carry up to a seven-year warranty along with other selected products, again with the after sales care afforded similarly to Stihl. The ranges of Stihl and Honda have worked well, being sold alongside each other and both being market leaders in their fields. Charles H Hill Ltd also stocks a range of Husqvarna ride-on mowers  including the rider range of front-mounted decks with articulated rear-wheel steering for excellent manoeuvrability. Also in stock at the  Horsington premises is the Etesia range of ride-on and pedestrian mowers. This company specialises in manufacturing very strong mowers  which will cut and collect grass even in wet conditions, marketed as they are as ‘anti-clog’ mowers. Future success Celebrating fifty years in  style, Charles H Hill Ltd now looks forward to continued success. Priding themselves on offering the very best after-sales service to customers,  the company will continue to expand the ranges stocked, ensuring customers receive high-quality products and outstanding services at all  times.
