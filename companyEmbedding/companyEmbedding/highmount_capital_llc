Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].
