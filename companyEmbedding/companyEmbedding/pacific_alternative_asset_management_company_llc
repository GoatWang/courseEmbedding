Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!

Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff

PRESS RELEASE
IRVINE, Calif. and NEW YORK, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — KKR and Pacific Alternative Asset Management Company, LLC (“PAAMCO”) today announced the completion of their strategic transaction to combine PAAMCO and Prisma Capital Partners LP (“Prisma”) to create PAAMCO Prisma Holdings, LLC (“PAAMCO Prisma”).
PAAMCO Prisma is now one of the largest firms in the liquid alternatives industry, with more than $30 billion of assets under management or advisement. PAAMCO Prisma offers a broad suite of liquid alternatives products that addresses a wide spectrum of client needs. Jane Buchan will continue as CEO of the PAAMCO business and Girish Reddy will be CEO of the Prisma business; Jane and Girish will be co-CEOs of the holding company, PAAMCO Prisma.
As previously disclosed, PAAMCO and Prisma’s core investment and client teams will remain unchanged, and the Prisma and PAAMCO brands and funds will continue to exist side-by-side. The firm offers all of the products and strategies clients have invested in historically, with the additional benefits of operational scale and access to a broader suite of investment solutions. 





Henry Kravis and George Roberts, co-Founders and co-Chairmen of KKR, stated when the transaction was announced: “We are bringing together two leading names to create an even stronger liquid alternatives firm. The decision to combine Prisma with PAAMCO is based on our shared view that a larger enterprise with exceptional resources, technology and investment acumen will be even better positioned to support clients in today’s marketplace.”
The business is majority employee-owned, with employees of PAAMCO Prisma Holdings owning 60.1% of the business and KKR owning a 39.9% interest as a long-term strategic partner.
About PAAMCO Prisma Holdings
PAAMCO Prisma Holdings combines two leading firms, each with a history of performance, innovation, and steadfast dedication to serving as fiduciaries to their investors. PAAMCO and Prisma were both put into business by institutional investors and share a long-standing commitment to serving the needs of the world’s preeminent investors. Each firm brings with it a track record of performance and leadership in alternatives, as well as innovative alpha strategies such as Prisma Apex Tactical (Prisma’s unconstrained thematic strategy) and Horizons (PAAMCO’s liability-driven investing approach), among many others.
As PAAMCO Prisma Holdings, the firms together offer a broad suite of liquid alpha solutions to address a wide spectrum of client needs. With over $30 billion in assets under management or advisement and a shared vision for the future of asset management, we believe PAAMCO Prisma Holdings is well-positioned to remain at the forefront of innovation and alpha creation.

Philosophy[edit]
PAAMCO has established a Sector Specialist approach in which senior investment professionals lead a research-driven investment management process to build customized hedge fund portfolios. The firm requires full position-level transparency from its underlying hedge fund managers and has established a multi-strategy, institutional and customized approach to investing in hedge funds for institutional investors. PAAMCO’s emphasis is on early stage managers that research and experience have shown to outperform more established hedge funds.[2] As needs and best practices took shape, PAAMCO created a proprietary managed account platform in 2005 to allow enhanced oversight and a greater ability to tailor exposures for its clients. In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[3]
PAAMCO was ranked #2 among alternatives managers for Best Places to Work in 2014.[4]
Strategy[edit]
The firm is specialized in the following strategies:convertible bond hedging, distressed debt, equity market neutral, event-driven equity, fixed income relative value, long/short credit, long/short equity and opportunistic investments.
History[edit]
PAAMCO was founded in 2000 by four partners, including Jane Buchan,[5] who is involved with 100 Women in Hedge Funds, and who received a BA from Yale and a PhD from Harvard.[6] PAAMCO expanded its U.S. operations to London in 2003 and Singapore in 2006.[7] In February 2011, the CAIA Association and PAAMCO announced a partnership to provide 10 scholarships towards the CAIA designation.[8] Co-founder Judith Posnikoff has endowed a scholarship at her graduate alma mater, University of California, Riverside.[9] Other founders include Bill Knight (PhD University of California, Riverside) and Jim Berens (PhD University of California, Irvine).[10]

Philosophy[edit]
PAAMCO has established a Sector Specialist approach in which senior investment professionals lead a research-driven investment management process to build customized hedge fund portfolios. The firm requires full position-level transparency from its underlying hedge fund managers and has established a multi-strategy, institutional and customized approach to investing in hedge funds for institutional investors. PAAMCO’s emphasis is on early stage managers that research and experience have shown to outperform more established hedge funds.[2] As needs and best practices took shape, PAAMCO created a proprietary managed account platform in 2005 to allow enhanced oversight and a greater ability to tailor exposures for its clients. In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standards of best practice endorsed by its members.[3]
PAAMCO was ranked #2 among alternatives managers for Best Places to Work in 2014.[4]
Strategy[edit]
The firm is specialized in the following strategies:convertible bond hedging, distressed debt, equity market neutral, event-driven equity, fixed income relative value, long/short credit, long/short equity and opportunistic investments.

PAAMCO was founded in 2000 by four partners, including Jane Buchan,[5] who is involved with 100 Women in Hedge Funds, and who received a BA from Yale and a PhD from Harvard.[6] PAAMCO expanded its U.S. operations to London in 2003 and Singapore in 2006.[7] In February 2011, the CAIA Association and PAAMCO announced a partnership to provide 10 scholarships towards the CAIA designation.[8] Co-founder Judith Posnikoff has endowed a scholarship at her graduate alma mater, University of California, Riverside.[9] Other founders include Bill Knight (PhD University of California, Riverside) and Jim Berens (PhD University of California, Irvine).[10]

Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
