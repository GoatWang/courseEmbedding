An investment in any of the AQR Funds involves risk, including loss of principal.

Please refer to the prospectus for complete information regarding all risks associated with the Funds. An investor considering the Funds should be able to tolerate potentially wide price fluctuations. The Funds are subject to high portfolio turnover risk as a result of frequent trading, and thus, will incur a higher level of brokerage fees and commissions, and cause a higher level of tax liability to shareholders in the Funds. The Funds may attempt to increase its income or total return through the use of securities lending, and they may be subject to the possibility of additional loss as a result of this investment technique.

The Fund seeks to invest in lower beta stocks of companies with stable businesses, high profitability, low operating and financial leverage, lower earnings-per-share variability and other measures of quality.These stocks generally are less volatile than the market average, and are expected to produce higher risk-adjusted returns over a full market cycle than market indexes. The Fund utilizes a proprietary optimization process and a number of sophisticated trading techniques to manage transaction costs.
