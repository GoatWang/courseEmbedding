Many of these  Irish families sailed to North America aboard overcrowded passenger ships. By far, the largest influx of Irish immigrants to North America occurred with  Great Potato Famine during the late 1840s. These particular immigrants were instrumental in creation of the United States and Canada as major industrial nations because the many essential elements such as the roadways, canals, bridges, and railways required an enormous quantity of cheap labor, which these poor immigrants provided. Later generations of Irish in these countries also went on to make valuable contributions in such fields as the arts, commerce, politics, and education. Extensive research into immigration and passenger lists has revealed many early immigrants bearing the name Shanahan: Shanahan Settlers in United States in the 18th CenturyJohn Shanahan, who landed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1765 [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.

    Buy PDF History »The surname Shanahan was first found in  County Clare (Irish: An Clár) located on the west coast of  Ireland in the province of  Munster, where they held a  family seat from very ancient times.Shanahan Spelling VariationsShanahan Spelling VariationsNumerous  spelling variations of the surname Shanahan exist. A partial explanation for these variants is that ancient scribes and church officials recorded names as they were pronounced, often resulting in a single person being recorded under several different spellings. Different spellings that were found include Shanahan, O'Shanahan, Shahan, Shannon, Gilshenan and many more.Shanahan Early HistoryShanahan Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Shanahan research.

Many of these  Irish families sailed to North America aboard overcrowded passenger ships. By far, the largest influx of Irish immigrants to North America occurred with  Great Potato Famine during the late 1840s. These particular immigrants were instrumental in creation of the United States and Canada as major industrial nations because the many essential elements such as the roadways, canals, bridges, and railways required an enormous quantity of cheap labor, which these poor immigrants provided. Later generations of Irish in these countries also went on to make valuable contributions in such fields as the arts, commerce, politics, and education. Extensive research into immigration and passenger lists has revealed many early immigrants bearing the name Shanahan: Shanahan Settlers in United States in the 18th CenturyJohn Shanahan, who landed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1765 [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Filby, P.
