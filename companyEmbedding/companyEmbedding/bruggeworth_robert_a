Good day and welcome to the Qorvo, Inc. Q1 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Doug DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations for Qorvo. Please go ahead.
Douglas DeLieto - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks very much, Keith. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.
In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance. During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com, under Investors.
In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant limit themselves to one question and a follow-up. Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Mark Murphy, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings call. Revenue for the June quarter increased 4% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to approximately $698 million. Revenue was above our quarterly guidance provided May 4, reflecting strength in Mobile in China, a large customer smartphone ramp and growth in IDP's broad markets. During the quarter, we saw customer demand coming strong than expected well within lead times and we worked hard to keep up with the demand. Our customers called on us and the Qorvo delivered.
Gross margin was 48.2%, reflecting low-band PAD business exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs. Also, lesser than impact, but in the mix, early yields on high volume quadplexers for China were below plan. In both examples, these were high volume products. Operating margin was 24% and operating expenses were approximately $169 million. The sequential increase in OpEx reflected higher R&D expense, increased variable compensation expense and the addition of GreenPeak Technologies. The company's higher R&D expense reflects increased investment in the designers of high-performance filters, SAW and BAW process engineers, and associated material costs for prototypes.

During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. Qorvo's June financial performance and September guidance provide context for two major initiatives underway: One, leveraging our BAW filter assets; and two, establishing filter independence. We expect these initiatives to support margin expansion early next year, as new customer programs ramp.
Qorvo today is number one or number two in the majority of our growth markets, and we are investing to extend our leadership. We're building a technology moat to maintain leadership, where we're number one. And where we're number two, we're investing to advance from a challenger to the leader. How will we do this? First, we will leverage our BAW filters. The vast majority of our customers from newcomers to market leaders are requesting more highly integrated solutions with even greater capabilities, including receive diversity modules with integrated LNAs, RF Flex modules with quadplexers, RF Fusion modules with hexaplexers, Wi-Fi FEMs with BAW filters and multi-chip modules to support massive MIMO.
An increasing number of these solutions contain BAW filters and BAW filters rank first among our growth drivers. BAW filters will also deliver the highest incremental margin for Qorvo, and BAW filters are a primary driver of our long-term operating model. To keep pace with customer demand, we're staffing up our engineering teams to complete the up fit of our Richardson fab from 6-inch to 8-inch. We're also bringing up an 8-inch line in a recently acquired fab in Farmers Branch, Texas. Today, our BAW filter utilization is below optimal, but we expect that to reverse as new programs ramp next year.
Demand for our first quadplexers has been robust and we continue to enjoy large customer interest in our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes. More importantly, we have delivered hexaplexer solutions utilizing our recently released next-generation BAW process and customer feedback indicates we are very competitive. For the premium tier, we are integrating BAW-based hexaplexers into RF Fusion, and in the performance tier, we are integrating BAW-based quadplexers.
Second, we will achieve filter independence. We believe Qorvo's growth will rely increasingly on filters and filter-based products and we are adding high performance filter designers and SAW and BAW process engineers to in-source all filters to improve our cost, accelerate time to market and deliver higher value solutions. Today, our largest revenue product, which is growing significantly this quarter, contains third-party SAW filters. By comparison, our RF Flex modules next year will integrate high performance and lower cost internally-sourced Qorvo filters for the first time. This will significantly enhance our product margins while creating a new competitive barrier to entry.
To ensure we achieve filter independence, we are increasing from 6-inch to 8-inch BAW in Richardson and we're increasing from 4-inch to 6-inch SAW in temp-comp SAW in Florida. In Greensboro, we're converting our 6-inch gas capacity to temp-comp SAW and adding a new power metal process for SAW, which is another Qorvo first. Of note, Qorvo's power metal process for SAW is the final process needed in our toolbox, if you will, clearing the path for us to achieve filter independence. We're also moving our gas capacity from North Carolina to our Oregon fab and transitioning our North Carolina GaN products to Texas. In China, we're bringing up our second packaged assembly and test facility, even as these efforts add to COGS and R&D today. We expect them contributing to revenue and margin expansion related to large customer opportunities slated for 2017 and 2018.
Looking at our June quarterly performance by segment, Mobile Products revenue was approximately flat year-over-year and increased 18% sequentially to $547 million. Qorvo helped launch a number of premium and performance tier smartphones and we benefited in China from a strong market and the migration from three-mode to full-mode smartphones for domestic and export markets.

We saw strong demand for our recently launched quadplexers, and for our second-generation RF Flex modules, which launched last year. In Wi-Fi, for handsets, we enjoyed 13% growth sequentially, as we ramped our highly integrated RF Fusion, for mobile Wi-Fi. Outside of handsets, Mobile Products grew 30% versus last quarter. Across all of Mobile Products, customer order activity strengthened throughout the June quarter with many orders placed well within lead times. Through the month of July, order activity in Mobile remained very strong. It's clear to us the demand for broadband data continues to increase with the effect amplified for RF suppliers as content per device experience.
We believe the expanding market requirements for carrier aggregation and 5G among others will favor our unique competitive strengths and we expect this to support strong longer-term dynamics and improving visibility into our growth drivers. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly integrated solutions.
In IDP, revenue grew 24% year-over-year and 6% sequentially to $151 million. We are very pleased with the performance of IDP, particularly the revenue and margin performance, the addition of a great franchise in GreenPeak Technologies and the achievement of another strong design win quarter. GreenPeak is growing at a rapid clip and we expect this acquisition to be accretive by the end of the year.
IDP continues to reposition their product portfolio to support high growth markets, and today, they are highly diversified business in a $3.8 billion serviceable market. IDP currently forecasts the markets they serve will grow at a compound annual rate of 17%, which nearly doubles their market by 2020 to $7 billion. In our infrastructure unit, we continue to see a stabilization in the China base station market and strong customer activity, especially in GaN. We enjoyed robust demand for our 3.5 gigahertz GaN PAs during the quarter and we supplied duplexers, LNAs and PAs for small cell solutions at multiple base station OEM customers.
On the design front, our GaN PAs were selected by a major infrastructure provider for a massive MIMO active antenna system. Two global wireless infrastructure manufacturers selected our 28 gigahertz 5G base station GaN PAs and a major infrastructure provider selected our 2.6 gigahertz PA, LNA and switch for pre-5G MIMO deployment. In connectivity, we saw strong momentum in CPE Wi-Fi, particularly 5-gigahertz, and we layered in GreenPeak Technologies during the quarter. GreenPeak is a recognized industry leader in ultra low-power short-range RF communication and they expand our customer offering very nicely to include highly integrated RF systems on a chip for the connected home and Internet of Things. The markets we are targeting are growing faster than 40%.
In transport, we began the production ramp of a quad linear 400G optical driver for a Tier 1 telecom equipment provider. We also reached record revenue levels for our CATV hybrid products driven by the industry leaders. Both support the build-out of infrastructure to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for data. In defense, our business is up 30% year-over-year. Most of this growth has been driven by domestic, active electronically scanned array radar programs, and the proliferation of gallium nitride, especially for international markets. In the defense market alone, we anticipate greater than $300 million of potential opportunities for Qorvo's GaN products.
So, from a high level, whether you're looking at IDP or Mobile Products, Qorvo is delivering breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. In IDP, we're introducing breakthrough products using highly differentiated internally developed technologies that enable our customers to introduce products at record speed and with higher levels of functionality. In Mobile, we're leveraging the industry's most complete product and technology portfolio with our broad scale, integration capabilities, and system level expertise to offer high-performance RF solutions with unprecedented levels of integration.

In summary, Qorvo saw customer order activity accelerate as the June quarter progressed, and the entire Qorvo team ran hard to satisfy that demand. In the September quarter, we continue to see strong demand and support of this year's most popular devices and we're rapidly expanding our capabilities to develop new, highly integrated solutions for large customer opportunities launching in 2017 and 2018.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's non-GAAP revenue increased 15% sequentially for the June quarter to $698 million. Mobile Products revenue increased 18% sequentially to $547 million, and Infrastructure and Defense Products increased 6% sequentially to $151 million. Qorvo had three 10% customers, the largest at approximately 29% of revenue representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Huawei and Samsung.
Gross margin was 48.2%, impacted by low-band PAD business, exceeding expectations with higher than expected costs. Upon transition to more integrated modules with Qorvo-produced filters and completion of our fab conversions, we expect gross margin to expand. Operating expenses increased to $169 million, on higher R&D expenses to support ongoing development programs in premium filters, higher variable compensation expense, and the addition of our GreenPeak acquisition. In the September quarter, we expect to achieve our OpEx goal of approximately 20% of sales, and we expect to sustain that performance through the December quarter. Operating income for the June quarter was $168 million or 24% of revenue. Net income was $143 million and earnings per share was $1.08.
Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and short term investments was $447 million. Cash flow from operations was $59 million, reflecting the working capital build associated with higher first quarter sales and our September quarter outlook. Capital expenditures increased to $130 million, primarily to address growing premium filter demand. During the June quarter, we completed our $500 million ASR, retiring an additional 400,000 shares. $250 million remains available under the $1 billion program authorized last November.
We continue to make progress on opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. In the quarter, we acquired GreenPeak, a producer of low-power RF devices, expanded our capabilities to serve IoT markets. Our BAW products are closing in on state-of-the-art performance and we're on a measured pace to add capacity needed to meet expected customer demand for premium filters.
As Bob mentioned, a large number of productivity projects are underway including conversion to 8-inch BAW wafers in our Texas fab and 6-inch SAW on our Florida fab. Conversion of our North Carolina fab, to TC-SAW and SAW, consolidation of our gas capacity in Oregon, migration of GaN from North Carolina to Texas, an additional Mobile Products assembling and test capacity in China. We expect these new product capabilities, capacity additions, and productivity initiatives to help us sustain above market growth and drive margin expansion.
Now, let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes customer demand supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the September quarter. Quarterly revenue between $820 million and $850 million, gross margin of approximately 47%, diluted EPS between $1.35 and $1.45, a tax rate of approximately 10%. Our September quarter guidance reflects strong broad-based demand, we expect gross margins to remain near the second quarter level through the year on low-band product mix and while our fab conversions are underway. We expect OpEx to trend down through the back half of the year. We project CapEx to remain elevated as we align capacity additions with stronger customer demand for premium filters and our integrated modules.

With that, we'll open up the call to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll take our first question from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Please go ahead.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Hey. First of all, let me ask for clarification on the September guide. Should we think that most of your growth is coming again from Mobile, like almost all of it in the September guide?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Harsh, that's correct. Most of the growth we are seeing is in Mobile. There will be some growth in IDP, but I think, most of the growth is coming from Mobile.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. So, you are expecting IDP to grow as well a little bit?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And then, I wanted to ask about gross margins, we've already started to get questions on that quite a bit. So, I think the "as people say in this business," the high watermark was somewhere around 50%, 51%, Bob. We're at 47% now and you've got a bunch of initiatives going and I think, you mentioned in your script that it will start the reverse and go up next year. Will you be going up from a base of 46%, 47%, where you are at or are you thinking you can possibly start to climb up from the 50%s and then move up from there?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Harsh, thanks for the question. I just want to clarify, we've got a lot of initiatives and we are working on them. We have a one product if you will problem today. That we've got to reverse and we'll continue to work hard to drive that and it all comes down to how much of that product we sell can influence the gross margin percentage as you can well imagine. So, it's got a lot of content that is not internally in our fabs, we don't see the benefits of it from a contribution margin, so that does play into it. When we have our Analyst Day, we'll outline and quantify a lot of those activities to help you model next year where we can get to on the gross margin.
Operator
And we'll go next to Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thank you for taking my question. So, Bob, maybe just to follow up on that gross margin. I just want to clarify, the lower gross margins that you are seeing is just because you are outsourcing a certain component, so this is really a near-term company specific issue that can be corrected. This is not the sign of some industry-wide pricing dynamic, right. I just want to get that clarified explicitly.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Sure, Vivek. So, let me start with, IDP is doing very well. Their margins held in there, no problem there. The majority of Eric's business did very well. You're right, we have one product. I will be candid with you, it's also not yielding fantastic, but for the most part, you're correct, it is a product related, not an industry structure issue. I would agree with your assessment, Vivek.
Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, very good. And then, as my follow up, when I look at the September quarter outlook, I sort of fell out of my chair when I saw the upside versus some of the Street expectations. But I'm curious, is there a pull forward of demand just because we are reminded of last year when the industry went through a lot of turbulence. So, you're nearly $120 million above Street expectations. First, how much is GreenPeak out of that, and then do you think there is any pull forward of demand? And the last part of that is how to think about December quarter season now given that you're having such a strong September quarter?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

Yeah. Number one, GreenPeak's in that $6 million, $7 million a quarter, so that's not driving all the growth. Like we said, most of the growth is coming out of Eric's business. I don't think we're seeing the pull forward. We've talked a lot about that. We still have a lot of demand that we're running hard to keep up with given the guide we even gave. As far as December goes, let me put it another way, Vivek, I think the growth that we're seeing this quarter as well as into December will be how well marquee phones sell. I think our own view is China, we're tempering our outlook for the second half of the calendar year. So, as we look into December, depends on to your question, how much of the demand is pulled in that we might be able to capture because we're all out right now. We ran very hard in the June quarter. We're running pretty hard still staying through this quarter. So as we look at things today, we're not seeing a pull forward and as we look at our customer forecast and our own expectations for in particular China market, we could see December up.

Thank you. We're going next to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.
Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Kulin Patel for Ambrish. My first question is on the increasing R&D spending particularly for filter designers, what drove the increase in OpEx for R&D given that you already have what seems like a mature BAW and SAW product?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Eric, do you want to take what drives filter designer and...
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah, we have talked many times about that portfolio shifting towards more filter based products and we do continue to see that trend and in fact if anything, accelerating through all tiers of the market now, customers asking us to integrate at a higher level and include more filters and Bob mentioned our drive towards filter independence and making sure that we have the ability to design and manufacture at least the lion's share, if not all of those filters internally, so that includes regular SAW as well as TC-SAW and BAW. And so, we will continue to need more R&D bandwidth to develop the processes, but then also to develop the products and integrate them into our portfolio.
Kulin Patel - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Right. Thanks. And for my follow-up, how much growth do you see for China for your Mobile business in the quarter?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
In the June quarter, it was pretty strong and in the September quarter, we see it continuing. As of now, the market is quite healthy and we are returning back to our kind of normal share that we should have been at earlier in the year already. So, we're kind of seeing that compound effect probably and then added to the fact that the dollar content overall continues to grow as we see more and more five-mode and six-mode 4G phones being shipped into the market.

Thank you. We'll go next to Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Thanks guys for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. Maybe Mark, if you could, give a little bit of stratification on some of those initiatives, the gross margin drivers that you guys have layered initiatives in in the past and been able to make pretty significant and sometimes rapid progress especially when it came to yield. So I guess can you just maybe talk about the timing of some of those major buckets of initiatives?
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think Cody, look, right now, we'll give more specifics at the November Investor Day, but we see a path to above 50% gross margin with both the trends in the business, specifically a move to more BAW mix in the future and then also all the initiatives underway which you heard about. We're in the early innings in the number of those initiatives. So within the next several quarters, those will be completed and we expect, as you know wafer conversions 4-inch to 6-inch and 6-inch to 8-inch provides a significant benefit on throughput and then we'll be over some of the yield issues that we're having.

Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
And maybe the follow-up then on yields. Bob said that those just weren't trending where you had expected. I guess, what's the opportunity to improve those in the current spends and how quickly can those yields improve?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Hey, Cody, this is Eric. It's a little tough to answer that. They can improve tremendously. The rate depends upon exactly how we get from here to there. Part of the nature of these products is that they ramp into very high volumes very rapidly, and so sometimes by the time you realize there is a yield issue, you already have an awful lot of product in the pipeline. That's why we are here. So we can improve them over the course of several quarters is probably the best way to answer that.

Thank you. We'll go next to Mike Burton with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.
Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC
Hey, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong top line and bottom line. You've obviously got a growth coming from a bunch of products with Wi-Fi and as well as the multiplexers. But I'm just curious if you could break out for us or give us a sense how big those businesses are now, where do you believe they can grow to, and then the effect on gross margins and operating margins for both of those products. Obviously multiplexers you talked about having some yield issues, but just kind of overall at a steady run rate, what kind of gross margin profile do we expect?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Mike, on the multiplexers, the quadplexers in particular for China, I'd be embarrassed to actually quote the gross margins, and we expect those to be significantly above the corporate average. And Wi-Fi is in family with the corporate average. We do fairly well there in general. And then obviously ones where we build the RF Flex for the Wi-Fi, that does have a better than company average margin.
Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC
Okay. And then also – sorry if I missed this, but you talked about some more R&D spend. Just kind of thoughts of OpEx trending forward during this fiscal year.
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Yes. What you'll see Mike, you'll see OpEx in the second quarter on a dollar basis about in line with what you saw in the first quarter. But on a percent basis, will be down towards our long-term target, which is 20% of sales. And then you'll see OpEx on a dollar basis begin to drop off through the second half as some spending we know falls off and productivity programs continue.

And we'll go next to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to ask about gross margins just to make sure I understand you guys correctly. So in the quarter, what were some of the surprises that drove the miss in gross margins and what's causing the leg down in the September quarter despite the huge ramp in revenue?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You want to take that or you want me to?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Well, again, it's primarily a single product problem and it's a low-band PAD problem where we have significant outsourced filter content. And that was a large volume product in the first quarter and it actually becomes larger in the second quarter as another low-band PAD family product comes on. So that's the effect you're seeing in first quarter and second quarter.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, Toshiya, we expected better costs as well as our yields didn't hit where we expected to be at this point in time.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Okay, great. And as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about BAW. You talked in your prepared remarks about utilization rates in your BAW business being suboptimal today. Could you maybe provide a bit more granularity here and also comment on when you expect utilization rates to be at or above optimal levels in BAW? Thank you.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. Thanks, Toshiya. What I said was we were not at optimal levels today and we've added capacity and we're continuing to add capacity as we expand from 6-inch to 8-inch and adding 8-inch in the Farmers Branch and quite honestly it's going to be the timing of new marquee phones that we're launching in, in calendar year 2017.
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
And I'll just add that we're going to pace that investment as we get clarity on customer demand. We feel very good about the customer demand and the quality of our product. So we're comfortable making early commitments, but the actual construction spend pace will be determined by our clarity on wins.

And we'll take our next question from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yes, thank you. Just a question on the yield issue and as it relates to gross margin. You talked about gross margin staying here through the year. Do you have line of sight as to just the cost issue part of this, or any other color you can have in terms of how you maybe deem conservative or not as to kind of the recovery from this?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Again, it's a little hard to tell the rate and pace of recovery. There are certain things that could move the needle actually relatively quickly. We're planning on it being a longer haul, as I said a couple quarters, to fix the issue, again, primarily because there's a lot of volume in the line early part of the ramp. So I think we're now well in, in terms of the number of parts produced. We understand the yield issue quite well. And so I don't think there is a lot of uncertainty from this point forward other than how rapidly we can implement the changes and get it through the pipeline.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. And then as my follow-up, in terms of capital allocation, you did GreenPeak, which is kind of tuck-in; you've been fairly aggressive buying back stock. So big picture, how you view best use of cash here in terms of your own stock versus attempts to diversify the business?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Mark, you want to take that?
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Yes, it's a good question. I guess I'll start with buyback. We've repurchased $1.3 billion of shares in the last five quarters, and we have $250 million remaining on our $1 billion authorization. I'll add that we currently expect to continue buying our shares under that authorization. We're interested obviously in a thoughtful capital allocation framework. That will consider organic growth opportunities, including CapEx needs which we just talked about on BAW. Those are very high-return projects, relatively low risk from a project execution standpoint. So those would be early priority on spend.
We're always looking at acquisition opportunities that would fit well with Qorvo, but I'll add that we're not capacity constrained from a balance sheet standpoint to doing those, but there's a very high bar on return requirements for allocation of capital to those opportunities. And then we plan to be regular steady buyers of our shares as part of this thoughtful capital allocation framework and that's what we've done.

Our next question is from Ed Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.

Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
Thanks a lot. Eric, you said you were surprised by that gross margin on the low-band PAD coming in here and the several comments that intimated both there was a cost and a yield issue. Yield I get I suppose because you can always get surprised, but can you explain what happened on cost? It was at the SAW filters? Did they raise prices to you? Was it not BAW pricing? What changed from the time that you did the prototype and you bid the part and won the part to the time you started producing the part that smacked margins as hard as they were? And then, as a follow-up, you've got a gazillion programs going on here. You're moving to 8-inch in BAW in Richardson. Are you starting an 8-inch in Farmers Branch? Are you ramping an 8-inch? Meaning, is it already up and running moving to 8-inch?
You have 6-inch in TC in Florida. You're launching, I'm assuming, a 6-inch TC and a SAW in North Carolina, moving GaN to Texas, moving GaAs to Oregon and a new PAD facility in China. Maybe you could take a few minutes to just walk through what the impact of some or all of these are on the margin issues, maybe none, maybe some, and whether it's utilization whatever, because as I'm sure most of the other guys on this call were getting flooded with gross margin questions even before the call started. So any help would be appreciated.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
All right, I'll take the easiest one. We're starting out in Farmers Branch on 8-inch. So we will start with what we believe will be our lowest cost there, and again, we'll qualify the line in 2017 and be ready for production in 2018. As far as what's going on in the packaging assembly and test facility, again that's one of the largest premerger synergies that we talked about is because a lot of the legacy work is outside assembly houses, and in fact given the volume we're running right now, we have a lot of work on the outside and that's why they're bringing up. And we had our grand opening in Dezhou just a few weeks ago, and as we in-source that, that is a significant cost savings for us.
As far as, yes, in Greensboro, we're starting in 6-inch with standard SAW and temp-comp SAW and it's a significant margin improvement over what we're paying outside, I'll say it that way. But it will take time to get those into the market and designed into current product. So, again, much more of a 2017 story than a 2016 story. And as far as, you know the diameters and you can do the math on what the savings is from 6-inch to 8-inch and we'll give you a lot more color on the timing of that at the Analyst Day. But, again, most of these things really take hold in 2017. I know you had a question for Eric as well.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yes. We probably can't say much about the outsourced content to your question other than to say that it's a source that's clearly not a long-term viable candidate. There's not much flexibility in the near-term in terms of pricing and what we can do with that supplier. Internally, though, the yields are related to some specifications at the end product level, but also to your point, this is the first volume to ramp very hard in the new 6-inch TC line, and we're definitely working out a lot of issues in there as well that's contributing certainly to the issue.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Steve Smigie with Raymond James.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Great. Thanks a lot. Guys, I was wondering if you could comment on what you think your total dollar content gains were for premium phones say this year versus last year – and I know there are tons of SKUs and stuff, but a rough assessment for the flagship phones?

Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
What I do feel confident in is we grew our dollar content. Clearly at one of our customers you guys know we grew significantly more dollar content as they released phones throughout the year. If I look at our top three customers, we've expanded our dollar contents. And to your point, it really gets down to mix on SKUs, but I think in aggregate, we've definitely increased our share as well as our dollar content.
J. Steven Smigie - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay, great. And I just wanted to follow-up on Vivek's question a little bit around seasonality. So you talked about growing in December. Does that growth suggest anything about how it might look into March? Typically you have a pretty steep dip. And so I'm just wondering if this is being pull forward somewhat, does that suggest a more shallow March or would that trend more normally?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, to be clear, I don't believe I acknowledged there's any pull forward. I said if there was, then it could impact December. But right now we don't view it as demand being pulled forward. I think if you look at what happened last year, and I think it's pretty widely known that some of the marquee phones didn't quite sell as well into the December quarter, which impacted December and slightly in the March. So I think it all does come down to if you're asking what December and March are going to look like. As we said, China, we seem to be getting back to our normal share levels there, so that's where the strength in the China market that we see. We see it continues to migrate from 3-mode, to 5-mode and 4-mode. So that's dollar content. We think that China market is doing well, but we have a conservative view in my comments for December. And to your point, typically, March is down seasonally, and I don't think that's going to change from any other year.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Caso with CLA (sic) [CLSA] (38:48).
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Thank you. Just a follow-up question with regard to China and the comments, and I think you've talked about tempering your expectations, yet the revenue growth is strong. So if maybe you could clarify more specifically what your expectations would be for China as you go into the September quarter, how much of that is dialed into your growth expectations, and then perhaps into the December quarter as well?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
So we do have growth in China dialed in that's based on actually very strong backlog at this time in order activity and visibility into the dollar content expansions that our customers are asking for these phones. However, the majority of the growth is not driven by China this quarter. It's driven by other large customers in marquee phone ramps.
Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC
Okay, great. And as a follow-up, we've heard I guess different commentary from different folks with regard to inventory levels at customers now as you're going into the seasonally stronger period of the year. I guess two questions on that. One is, although you took a hit from some inventory reductions back starting in last December quarter, do you think those still persisted in the June quarter, such that you're shipping below customer consumption? And at this point as we go into the September quarter, do you think those inventory reductions are now complete?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I'd rather just make this comment at a very high level. Typically, we ship into our customers well before they start selling because they build up their inventory to go. So typically in June, we would typically be under shipping what they're selling. So, what I can say is specifically about our business, we saw what was coming, we took actions in December, a little bit in March, but we were pretty much clean starting in June.

Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And Chris, I'll add that, our turns did increase about 10% and then our inventory levels did go up about $30 million, but that was, as you can see now, to prepare for the September and follow-on quarter.

Sorry, we are not going to be able to comment.
Wayne Loeb - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. I will try one more thing then. On envelope trackers, are you seeing some traction there. It seems like some other non-Qualcomm modems do not yet have an envelope tracker, are you seeing some traction or any attachment to that?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think Eric would love to talk about ET PMICs.

Thank you. We'll go next to Atif Malik with Citigroup.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on gross margins, as well your peer Skyworks guided flat margins on revenue growth in September, you guys are guiding down gross margins. I understand there's no structural change in the pricing environment. But can you comment on maybe parts of the market like low-band PADs, which are more commoditized. And if you can also help me understand why you would be chasing low-band PADs if you have been stronger in the mid-band and high-band historically?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Go ahead, Eric.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah, sure. I want to say quite clearly that this is not a pricing issue. I also actually take issue in saying low-band PAD is a commoditized business. I don't think that's the case at all, especially these high performance low-band PADs with temperature-compensated SAW filters in them. These are very high performance products, very few people can manufacture them. It's not commoditized and there's not a pricing issue going on here at all.
Because they're incredibly hard to manufacture, we're having some yield, ramping a new one and associated with again our new wafer line in it. So, why we're in the low-band PAD business? It's actually a premium product category and we see a lot of customers now asking us and giving us the opportunity to do the entire RF frontend. You need to have low-band, mid-band and high-band, all the switching and power management so forth to be able to do that. So it's an important part of the portfolio, it's going to be a very powerful part of the portfolio as well going forward.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Great. And as a follow up, Mark, can you talk about the full fiscal 2017 CapEx expectations for the year?
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We're going to be about, if I recall, about 15% of sales for the year, if we maintain our pace of spend. Just to be clear, I mentioned that if we don't have the clarity, we'll certainly slow down the spend. So, I'd say I don't expect it to be any worse than about 15%.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Co.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC
Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on that BAW capacity question. You mentioned a couple of times on the call that you're not at optimal levels. I'm just wondering, are you referring to the fact you're underutilized currently or you guys are running full out and you need to add capacity in the near-term to meet demand? And then I've got a follow-up question.

Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Quinn, we are not running at capacity or nowhere close to that. So I would tell you, we're under loaded than from optimum.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC
Got it. Okay, great. And then, just coming back to the gross margin, obviously, you talked a lot about the low-band PAD. I was wondering if you could make any comments about sort of the China product gross margin especially as you ramp the quadplexers, hexaplexers, is the mobile product going into China carrying sort of corporate or at least mobile product average gross margins? Is there anything you can distinguish in terms of gross margin contribution from China versus some of the premium customers?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So there's really not a large difference. There's a wide – not a wide range – but there's a range of gross margins for the different product types that sell into China. In general, the portfolio, especially the newer products are basically in line with the average mobile portfolio margins.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Yes. Thank you. Just wondering here on the revenue guidance has a range of $30 million versus in the past you gave us specific targets. What's some of the sensitivity there? What percent booked are you to get to the midpoint?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
We have a great new CFO, who thought that maybe we ought to be able to provide you guys with more of a range, because of his experience and looking at our past performance that it's probably more prudent to do that. And I think you also noticed one of our competitors also gave a range, who typically gave a point. So, we just thought it would be good to give you the clarity there in the range. And as far as booked for the quarter between our backlog, customer forecast, things like that, we're in good shape.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Good shape. Okay. Great. And then just a clarification on gross margins, low-band PADs impacted by the sourcing of filters. Sounds like you've got multiple products, multiple models. I mean, can seasonality in the coming quarters ever cause a more favorable mix shift later this fiscal year or are we really waiting for the fiscal 2018 manufacturing efficiencies and filters that come online?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
This part, as you said seasonality or sell-through of the end customers' products can definitely impact our percentage of gross margin, absolutely.

Our next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry for another gross margin one. Just wanted to clarify. So the gross margin was weaker in June, and then in September it's down a little bit more. It sounds like two issues, you have an issue on multiplexers, and then you had this low-band PAD. I was just trying to understand what the impact was in both quarters? Did you quantify it? And then just understand what's the bigger driver between those two?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, Blayne, the quadplexers had a larger impact in the June quarter than the low-band PAD and the low-band PAD has a bigger impact, much bigger impact this quarter, and the quadplexers we've taken some actions and made some progress.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Got you. And then just a follow-up in terms of the yield issues, has that impacted any delivery dates or what's your lead times? And then, in terms of fixing these issues, do these require redesigns of any of these parts which then need to be re-qualified on phones or is it something you can you do on the fly in a given model?

Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Pretty detailed question. Yeah, so I would say, yield issues of course, we're working through those and assuring a continuation of the supply. Organization is working really, really hard to do that. In terms of redesign, not expected at all, potentially test program changes and so forth that, of course, we coordinate with our customers. But these are things that can happen relatively quickly.

Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Please go ahead.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Yeah, hi, guys. Good guide here. Just going back on the gross margin question again. As you guys (48:59) for the fiscal 2017 I guess, but as you look at pulling the filters in- house, I know one of your peers is sitting on a lot filter inventory and then obviously the Japanese OEMs all have a lot of filter exposure, filter supply there. Does that create more filter pricing pressure? What's your thoughts there?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm not sure I fully understood the question on...
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
I'm just wondering, as you pull your filters in-house, and there is obviously more excess filters in the supply chain, does that increase pricing pressure on the filter side?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. I'm sorry, I guess, we're having a hard time following why pulling the filter products inside would create excess inventory of filters and create pricing pressure. It would go the opposite way I think in...
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
...in discrete.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Yeah, yeah.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. Discrete filters are becoming a very small part of the market. The trend is that the filters are being integrated into higher level functionality such as our fusion modules and so forth.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And then when they're integrated, just to be clear, they're wafer level packaged opposed to packaged in a ceramic package, which is the way a discrete filter's sold.
Vijay R. Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Got it. And you talked about 6-inch and 8-inch transition here, what do you expect your mix of 6-inch and 8-inch by the end of calendar 2016, if you can give us some idea there? Thanks.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. As far as 8-inch BAW filters go, it's going to be a very low percentage, that's what we're converting to this year and again, as I've said, bringing up in Farmers Branch. And in SAW filters, as we continue to expand in Florida as well as bringing up the North Carolina facility, that mix will start to move to 6-inch a much larger percentage. Don't have the percentage off the top of my head again, we'll give you that at Analyst Day, but it will be a larger percentage 6-inch.

Thank you. We have a follow up from Harsh Kumar. Please go ahead.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.

Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
I don't think we did provide that.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hold on a second, Harsh. Give us a minute we'll go through it. Hold on.

Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
Okay. Then let me ask something else while you guys are looking at it. Mark and then, I think you mentioned that OpEx will fall as the back half approaches, can I ask you to clarify if it will fall as a percentage of sales or will it fall in absolute dollars from here?
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, what I said Harsh was that it'll be about flat on a dollar basis in the second quarter, the September quarter and will drop as a percent of sales basis to about 20%. In the subsequent quarters, we expect it to drop on a dollar basis.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
So, next year it could drop on a dollar basis. Got it. Thanks. And then whenever you guys...
Mark J. Murphy - Chief Financial Officer
Just to be clear, drop in the second half of this fiscal year on a dollar basis.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And Harsh, excluding Huawei who is a corporate 2% customer, as you know the China business is about a third of the mobile business in the June quarter and a bit less than the third in the September quarter.

Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
Thanks. You mentioned GaAs moving to Oregon, Bob are you consolidating all GaAs fab in Oregon or will you still be split between Oregon and North Carolina? And then TriQuint started TC-SAW, it was the first one to actually produce that filters years ago and I know that one of your competitors kind of leapfrogged you in modules to your largest customer and so they are large in TC-SAW. But I'm a little surprised you guys are having yield problems with TC-SAW. Is it a new process, a new part, given your legacy and how long you've been in this technology? What's changed there that made this more difficult part, just the filtered stuff, forget the module? Thanks.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, Ed, we are transitioning over time our Greensboro gallium arsenide as well as GaN and they will be focused on filters. And as far as the temp-comp SAW...
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. I think you hit on it earlier, we're doing a lot right now including adding factories in Florida and Greensboro and also going from 4-inch to 6-inch and managing issues of wafer breakage as well as parameter distributions, and as you really run more and more and more wafers to the new 6-inch line, you begin to see the full distribution. Also, I think the requirements at the end module are tougher, generation, regeneration, the requirements are getting harder. So dialing in these specifications at a very fine level is the issue.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
And I know you mentioned it, Bob, but to buy parts from the outside market like you're doing now because everybody outsources SAW at this point, even your competitors, you're buying a packaged part from them, which is large and more expensive, et cetera. When you go internally, it will be a wafer scale packaging, shouldn't we expect, and I don't know what the mix is, but I'm expecting you're using quite a bit of that product in some of your modules, low-band PAD, maybe diversity module. Shouldn't we expect to see a significant improvement in gross margin given the fact that one, you're producing and two, it's going to be smaller, more efficient part than what you could buy on the outside market already? And just if you could, maybe give us some idea of the timing of when you think you'll be independent in SAW?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
So maybe big picture Ed, certainly you're on the right track. We absolutely expect that when we can in-source these filter ourselves in our new larger factories that are well utilized, we will definitely see improvements in gross margin. And this is a multi-generational thing, this cannot happen overnight to completely eliminate outsourcing of the filters. We're starting on it, we're adding new capacity, adding the filter designers to be able to do it, it will take two or three product cycles to get there.

And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I will turn it to management for closing remarks.

Good day and welcome to the Qorvo, Inc. Q4 2016 Year-End Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Douglas DeLieto, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. DeLieto.
Douglas DeLieto - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thanks very much, Adam. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Qorvo's fourth quarter fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release published today, as well as the risk factors associated with our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, because these risk factors may affect our operations and financial results.
In today's release and on today's call, we provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of operating results and to analyze financial performance without the impact of certain non-cash expenses or other items that may obscure trends in our underlying performance.
During our call, our comments and comparisons to income statement items will be based primarily on non-GAAP results. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to our earnings release issued earlier today available on our website, qorvo.com, under Investors.
In fairness to all listeners, we ask that each participant please limit themselves to one question and a follow-up.
Sitting with me today are Bob Bruggeworth, President and CEO; Steve Buhaly, Chief Financial Officer; Eric Creviston, President of Qorvo's Mobile Products Group; and James Klein, President of Qorvo's Infrastructure and Defense Products Group. I'm also joined by other members of Qorvo's management team.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Bob.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Doug. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings call. Revenue for the March quarter totaled $607.1 million, exceeding our quarterly guidance, reflecting increased demand for our highly-integrated solutions and a return to growth in IDP broad target markets.
Gross margin was 50%, up 210 basis points sequentially, reflecting crisp execution by the Qorvo team. Operating margin was 26.4% with operating expenses of approximately $143 million, reflecting reduced variable compensation expense.
On February 17, we announced an accelerated share repurchase program and during the March quarter we were able to repurchase 10 million shares of common stock. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 share in the June quarter as part of the ASR and we have $250 million that remain authorized for future repurchases.
In Mobile Products, revenue was $465 million on the strength of content gains and smartphone program ramps. During the quarter, we launched an increasing number of highly-integrated, high-performance solutions that leveraged the breadth of our industry-leading portfolio of products and technologies. We enjoyed strong demand for our highly-integrated solutions led by products incorporating our premium filters. We expect these highly-integrated solutions will continue to drive our growth.

Qorvo's expanding family of RF Fusion solutions stands out as an example. These tightly-integrated compact solutions leverage our BAW and temp-comp SAW filters, our low-loss, high throw-count SOI switches, and our high-performance, low-noise amplifiers to deliver performance that's unmatched by competitive solutions.
In the China market, the deployment of carrier aggregation and the migration to full mode devices is increasing the demand for our RF Flex solutions, our BAW-based quadplexers and a broad variety of our antenna control solutions.
Looking into calendar 2017, our customers in China are asking us to integrate our premium filters into RF Flex to reduce complexity and enhance smartphone performance as carrier aggregation proliferates and bands and modes are added. Again, this strongly favors our broad product portfolio and integration capabilities.
In IDP, revenue grew 9% sequentially to approximately $142 million, reflecting a return to growth in IDP's broad target market. We indicated last quarter that IDP had repositioned its diverse portfolio of businesses to accelerate growth and we've begun to see the benefit of that sharpened focus. In automotive, IDP secured a significant design win with a Tier 1 automotive supplier, meaningfully expanding our opportunity in automotive infotainment systems at several European car manufacturers.
Elsewhere, in connectivity, IDP leveraged the superior performance of our integrated solutions in efficiency, thermal dissipation, range and a number of other key metrics to secure the lead position on Quantenna's QSR10G Wi-Fi solution. This solution enables the industry-first 10G Wave 3 solution through a True 8x8 MIMO configuration for 5GHz networks and a 4x4 MIMO configuration for 2.4GHz networks.
In Wireless Infrastructure, revenue grew by more than 25% sequentially, and we returned to more historic levels in our base station business. And again, we enjoyed increasing demand for Qorvo's high-frequency and high-power solutions across both infrastructure deployments and advanced defense application.
Across all our markets, it's increasingly clear that Qorvo's industry-leading portfolio of RF products and technologies represents a significant competitive advantage. Qorvo's offering our customers a combination of performance and integration that's not been available previously, putting us in a favorable position to gain content and outpace our market.
Equally important is our unique ability to match the optimum technology, or combination of technologies, to each customer's application without bias towards any one technology or architecture. Only Qorvo delivers a comprehensive product portfolio of filters, switches, amplifiers, PMICs, LNAs and tuners with the scale, integration capabilities and system-level expertise to supply an expanding variety of highly-integrated solutions. This is leading to deeper relationships with our customers, channel partners and carriers as they see greater economic value in maximizing spectral efficiency.
To monetize their respective investments, they're seeking increasingly precise, highly-integrated solutions optimized to solve specific challenges related to the delivery of broadband data. Qorvo is unique in its ability to address that need.
In both Mobile and IDP, Qorvo is leveraging our comprehensive product and technology portfolio to participate in the development of 5G standards to expand our growth opportunity. We are engaged in 5G field trials with infrastructure customers, and we are assisting in the development of key aspects of 5G next-generation wireless communication standards as a member of 3GPP.
In 2016, 3GPP is set to make significant progress in defining 5G use cases. 5G will enable speeds comparable to fixed broadband, with ultra-low latency and the capacity for massive-scale networks, creating exciting opportunities in new markets, like wireless residential broadband, autonomous driving, robotics, virtual reality, urban sensor networks and other applications leveraging deployment of the global Internet of Things ecosystem.

In IDP, we're introducing highly differentiated products that enable customers in high-growth markets to introduce products at record speed, and with higher levels of functionality. As an example, in automotive, our highly-integrated solutions maximize data throughput while solving the complex challenges related to spectrum congestion. The compound annual growth rate in automotive connectivity is forecasted to be 45% through the year 2020, and Qorvo's broad portfolio of RF solutions position us favorably for success.
Across all our markets, it's our goal to deliver breakthrough RF solutions that accelerate the delivery of broadband data and create value for our customers and our customers' customers. We intend to leverage our broad scale, industry-leading product and technology portfolio and strong organizational discipline to achieve operational excellence, capture value and deliver superior financial results.
We prioritize our uses of cash by investing in our business to drive growth, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and exploring opportunities for M&A to supplement growth in IDP.
Since our earnings conference call last quarter, we repurchased more than 10 million shares of common stock, we made an acquisition to expand into the Internet of Things, we commenced production of 6-inch temp-comp SAW in Florida, and 6-inch SAW in Greensboro to support a marquee smartphone this calendar year. And we're in the final days of qualifying our 8-inch BAW process in Texas.
Our BAW-based hexaplexer prototypes are demonstrating excellent performance, and we've begun to sample a highly-integrated RF Fusion that incorporates our hexaplexers. We see strong growth and increasing customer pull for these types of solutions in the coming years.
We recently acquired clean room space near our Richardson campus to support customer demand for BAW filters, whether they be in discrete implementations, quadplexers, pentaplexers, hexaplexers, diversity receive modules or other highly-integrated RF solutions. The facility is already fully operational, and it's our goal to incrementally convert the facility to BAW in the back half of next calendar year to support customer program.
As the industry's leading supplier of SAW, temp-comp SAW and BAW devices, we are adding capacity to keep pace with the increasing customer demand for our high, mid and low-band products. In fact, Qorvo will soon be in production with low-band PADs, mid-band PADs and high-band PADs all in premium tier marquee LTE smartphones.
Before handing off the call to Steve, I want to say a quick word about our acquisition of GreenPeak Technologies, which just recently closed. GreenPeak is a recognized leader in ultra-low power short-range RF solutions with an expanding business and customers all over the globe, a great number of who are already purchasing high-power solutions from Qorvo.
GreenPeak will become a part of IDP and will be run by Cees Links, their Founder and CEO. Cees Links is a recognized industry leader who was instrumental in the development and adoption of Wi-Fi technology. We expect GreenPeak's ultra-low power RF solutions and SOCs for the connected home and Internet of Things to nicely complement IDP's industry-leading portfolio of high-power solutions.
We have not included any revenue from GreenPeak Technologies in our June guidance. In the September quarter, we'll have a full quarter of GreenPeak revenue, and we'll begin to include it in our guidance then.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Steve for a more detailed look at our financials.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob. Qorvo's revenue for the March quarter was $607 million, much better than typical seasonality relative to the December quarter. Mobile Products' revenue declined 5% to $465 million, while IDP showed continued strength as revenue grew 9% to $142 million. Content gains in the Samsung Galaxy were the largest driver of the healthy sequential performance in Mobile.

Qorvo had three 10% customers, the largest at approximately 33% of revenue representing the aggregated demand of multiple subcontractors for this end customer. Our other 10% customers during the quarter were Samsung and Huawei.
Gross margin was 50%, up sequentially from 47.9%, reflecting the absence of a couple of yield issues experienced in the prior quarter. Operating expenses remained relatively low at $143 million, driven by reduced variable compensation expense. Operating income was $161 million, or just over 26% of revenue. Net income for the March quarter was $143 million, or $1.04 per diluted share based on 137.5 million shares outstanding.
Turning to the balance sheet, total cash and investments was $613 million, and cash flow from operations totaled $160.5 million. Capital expenditures were $84.4 million, primarily to address growth and demand for our premium filters.
The company repurchased approximately 10 million shares during the March quarter, under our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. As the actual purchase occurred about halfway through the quarter, the impact on the March quarter share count was about five million shares. We expect to repurchase an estimated 500,000 shares this quarter, as the ASR program is completed.
The ASR is part of our previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program, approved in November of 2015. After giving effect to the ASR, approximately $250 million remain authorized under this program for future repurchases.
We made good progress last quarter on significant long-term opportunities to improve our growth and profitability. We acquired a highly respected IoT firm, improving our SAM and growth prospects. We continue to improve both the fundamental performance capabilities of our SMR BAW process, and the capacity to produce to growing customer demand. Our acquisition of a former Maxim plant just a few miles from our existing operation in Richardson will provide low-cost clean room capacity for the next leg of BAW growth.
We saw strong progress on large cost-reduction initiatives: 8-inch BAW wafers, 6-inch TC-SAW wafers, and the insourcing of mobile assembly and test into our Chinese plants. It's an exciting time in RF and at Qorvo.
Now let's turn to our business outlook. Qorvo currently believes the demand environment in its end markets supports the following non-GAAP expectations for the quarter ending July 2, 2016. Quarterly revenue of about $650 million, gross margin of about 50%, net interest expense of approximately $15 million, a tax rate at approximately 10% and diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.05 based on approximately 133 million shares outstanding.
Our June revenue expectations indicate healthy 7% sequential growth, reflecting our strong book of business. Actual quarterly results may differ from these expectations; and as such, differences may be material. We currently expect to report June quarter results on August 2, 2016.
With that, I'd like to welcome your questions.

Thank you. The first question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.
Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. And congrats on a very strong quarter. My first question is regarding your revenue performance, both in the March quarter and in the June quarter. You seem to be clearly outperforming the overall industry. You talked to content gains in the Samsung Galaxy. But were there any other things that led to this outperformance?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks for your comments, Toshi. And clearly, IDP had strong growth, as we touched on, in the infrastructure business, as long as the connectivity business in the March quarter for pretty good performance.

Also, as you pointed out, we saw good strength from one of our 10% customers. I think it would be good – as we look at the June guidance, we are expecting both businesses to grow in June. But, I will tell you, the majority of the growth is going to be coming from the Mobile business. So, I'll let Eric talk a little bit about the growth.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Thanks, Bob. Yeah, I think in the June quarter, we are expecting to be up significantly, outside of our largest customer, in particular. And that's driven primarily by just the continued content growth in China. I think we're back on track with the next-generation solutions. We've announced RF Flex Gen-3 is already ramping into high-volume production. That's helping to carry some of the sequential growth.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd.
Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up is on the inventory situation. When I look at your balance sheet, I think inventory was up about $80 million on a year-over-year basis, while revenues were down about $25 million. Should we be concerned about your inventory level? Or do your current booking status support significant revenue growth, so that we shouldn't be concerned here? Thank you.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I don't think you should be too concerned, but two things to think about here. One is, we are doing some advanced building in anticipation of growth later this year. And then secondly, I think our inventory levels are a little heavy and we can improve our turns performance and we expect to do so. I don't have a concern about excess and obsolete type risks. We monitor that closely. We just went through a quarterly review. And I don't have concerns there, but I think that is an area where we can improve and will do so.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Burton from Brean Capital. Please go ahead.
Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC
Hey, guys, and my congratulations as well on the strong results, especially in this environment. Just following up on that second question first. Steve, if you could talk us through the puts and takes on gross margin with revenues heading up in the June quarter and then your thoughts about it going forward?
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, relative to the June quarter, we're back to expectations of 50%. As you might remember, that's pretty much where we've been running the last several quarters. Last quarter, we had a yield issue on a couple parts that knocked us down to just under 48%. In the absence of that, we're kind of back to where we have been at. And relative to the full-year, I'll offer a couple of things, since you ask. One is, we continue to believe our market is growing at a 10% to 15% rate and we believe we'll grow consistent with that.
Second, I think we have with that growth rate a good opportunity to see fiscal year 2017 earnings per share getting pretty close to $5 a share. If all goes well, we might hit that $5; but I would say, if I were modeling, I'd say we'll get up into the neighborhood, we'll get pretty close to $5.
And beyond that, I'm going to – gross margin and OpEx, that mix will depend on the type of business and opportunities we have as we go through the year.
Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC
Okay.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
And I'll add, I think tax rate should be about 10% and next quarter we expect shares to be about 133 million and we'll see what we do from there on.
Mike A. Burton - Brean Capital LLC
Great. And then also, Eric, it sounds like the China is picking up for you guys in Q2. I wonder if you're already starting to see some progress that you were planning on making at MediaTek. And then just also if you could just clarify, I know you said that growing in Q2 but was China up or down for you guys in Q1 as well?

Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. Thanks, Mike. No question we're much happier with our position in MediaTek now than we were six months to nine months ago. We announced at Barcelona the RF Flex Gen-3 solutions which are aligned with both MediaTek and Qualcomm, frankly. And seeing a pretty good uptake. We saw – exiting the March quarter, we began to see China really take off. So they were okay in March, but they weren't really the factor that helped offset seasonality as much as Samsung was.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Mike, I would also point out, as we touched on last quarter, we've got to let you guys know that we felt that the antenna tuners and a lot of those solutions, because of the metal cases starting to proliferate in our Chinese customers' designs, that's a great opportunity for growth for us. So, it's not just the power amplifiers. It's also our high-performance BAW filters, as well as some of our antenna tuners.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Harsh Kumar from Stephens. Please go ahead.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
Hey, guys. Congratulations from me as well. Fantastic numbers. Question, Bob, for you. As you look in the back half of the quarter, you've given the June guide – Steve's kind of talked about the EPS for the year. As you look on the back half of the calendar year, how do you see the market? And then I've got a follow-up.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. As far as the market goes, we're modeling pretty much flat handset growth. We're expecting people to continue to migrate up into the performance phones, and as well as the marquee phones, and driving the dollar content will continue to increase. So, we still expect the RF TAM for the Mobile business to grow 10% to 15%. We've repositioned James' business to start to get in the double-digit growth rates. So, coming back to the infrastructure, we are expecting a pretty solid year as we go forward.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
I just wanted to add, one of the exciting things in our business is the migration of the IDP business from a kind of a high single-digits growth rate to a mid-teens growth very comparable to what we see in the Mobile space. And this acquisition of GreenPeak is one more step in that direction.
Harsh V. Kumar - Stephens, Inc.
Got it. And then – hey, Steve, I think you touched on it just very briefly. I think you were supposed to have a major event, with your cost reduction strategy with your move to China. I was wondering if we could get a small update on that as it relates to what's going on there?
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Happy to. Most of the action is in the second half of the calendar year, as we can't really move parts that are in production. Our customers require us to start new parts in the location of manufacture.
And so that means we're intersecting with major product launches, as is typical to happen in the back half of the calendar year. So that's when we'll start to see the flow of savings at the level we expect. So you'll see a little bit of the benefit this calendar year, and you'll see all of the benefit next calendar year. And we are on track for the second $75 million installment of our synergy expectations.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
Thanks. Eric, there was a long list of product groups that are now using BAW, everything from diversity modules to all-in-ones like Fusion. Is that impact...
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Could you speak up a little bit, Ed? It's hard to hear you.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.

Sorry.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
I know it's hard to believe, but we...
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
I could. Let me speak in a normal voice, now. Check. Can you hear me now? You asked for it. Okay. So, Eric. So there's a long list of product groups now using BAW, everything from diversity to all-in-ones like Fusion. Did that impact your mix enough in Mobile to drive growth in operating margins? And do you expect that to occur or accelerate as we move through the year?
And then Steve, you touched on there the PAD facility in China. Has much or any of TriQuint product lines – I guess it's mostly new Qorvo product lines, because you can't move old ones back there – what percentage are you in terms of moving to the PAD facility at this stage? And I have one for James.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
I'll answer yours first. I'd say we're under 50% right now. And maybe closer to 25%. So it's a relatively modest portion, just because of the lead times to equip the factory, start the prototypes, intersect with customer product launches. So the vast majority of it will be second half of the calendar year.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
To the first part A, B and C of your question, the BAW product portfolio has filled out very nicely as you said. And we are shipping, in addition to the diversity receive modules now with BAW in it, several RF Fusion modules with BAW. And as you know, we released our first quadplexer for the China/CA market, also BAW-based. And traction in all of those has been very strong in March and continuing on into June, and certainly driving part of our growth. And as we've talked about, the gross margins on those are above our average, so that supports the expansion in gross margin. But of course, the growth being driven by that also helps the operating margin, to your point.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
Okay. And then, James, most of – there was a nice uptick in your business this quarter. Was that most all 4G base stations? And was that spread evenly across your customers? Did you see more of a pocket of strength in certain areas?
James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products
We had good growth in the wireless infrastructure, our base station business, and also in connectivity. As far as the base station side, it was really broad-based across the regions and across all of our top-tier customers in the space.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham. Please go ahead.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC
Hi, guys. Let me add my congratulations. Bob, wondering if you could just comment about inventory levels at your largest customer. It seems like they've obviously seen lower-than-expected demand. And I'm just wondering, do you think that that supply channel here as you come out of March looking into June is fairly clean, or do you think that there's excess component inventory that you may have shipped in previous quarters that still needs to be worked off? And then I've got a follow-up for Eric.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't think you're going to like my answer much. I think things are fine. We're in pretty good shape there. So not really much to add. Things look fine to us.
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC
The channel looks pretty clean from your perspective, it sounds like.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, and you know and I'm sure you remember, we kind of took the medicine in the December quarter in terms of lowered expectations for that particular customer (29:30).
Quinn Bolton - Needham & Co. LLC
Right, right. Okay. Great. And then for Eric, just obviously very strong growth in China here looking into the June quarter. Wondering if you'd give us some sense. Obviously you're ramping Gen-3 of RF Flex, but you also shipped some of the premium filters. Can you give us some sense? Is it fairly well balanced between RF Flex and filters? Or is one of those businesses much larger than the other?

And then sort of a follow-on question to that is last year you guys saw a massive June quarter in China, and it ended up leading to some inventory accumulation effective in September to December. As you look forward right now, do you think that that strength in China continues in the back half of the year? Or is it hard to have visibility that far out right now?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah, thanks for the question. For the portfolio that's growing in June in China in particular is very, very diverse. In addition to all the RF Flex and quadplexers and discrete filters and so forth that we're growing with most of the China suppliers, when we look at Huawei, that's a completely different set of dynamic. We also see them growing strongly in June, but based more on the RF Fusion portfolio, some of the more premium solutions in power management and so forth. So, really I think it's fair to say our entire product portfolio is involved in one way or the other with various tiers and manufacturers throughout China.
You have to remember, of course, even below Huawei, the other suppliers there, the leading suppliers like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, we have very good long-term relationships with these guys and they're looking to expand beyond just domestic consumption and export more, which is driving a need for more premium filters and more bands in their phones. So that just plays right into where we're investing.
Regarding your second point, yeah, very good point. Last year, we also had a very strong start to June. I think that has caused us to be pretty cautious. We are being just as careful as we can to make sure we're looking at the total demand and watching for customers that might be double-ordering or chasing the same slots and so forth. So, we're watching that really carefully.
I think another big part of last year was the MediaTek Phase 2 generation where we were, frankly, behind by one or two quarters and it was hard to catch up once we got there. So, this transition this time with Phase 3 and then looking into Phase 5 and Phase 6, at this time we look very, very well-aligned with MediaTek as well as the end customers.

Thank you. The next question comes from Cody Acree from Drexel. Please go ahead.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations, guys. Guys, on the BAW filter capacity, with Skyworks now pretty openly talking about having BAW filters in 2017. And of course, with them expanding their TC-SAW capacity, how do you see them changing the competitive landscape? And especially with all the expansion and filter capacity you've done yourself?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
As far as BAW filters go, I don't believe we see that changing the dynamic there. I think they're underestimating what it's going to take, I think the amount of IP, the capacity it's going to take. We're moving to 8-inch. The performance keeps improving generation over generation.
Quite honestly, I'm not sure where they're getting the technology or where they even have a factory to produce it. We currently do know of suppliers out there that are limited in their ability to use BAW filters coupled with a SAW filter. And you pick either you want the BAW and transmit or receive. So we're certainly familiar with those things, but just don't see it.
And as far as temp-comp SAW goes, high-performance filters, whether they're BAW or temp-comp SAW, continue to expand and grow. They are bigger than Qorvo in temp-comp SAW. We are expanding capacity for programs that we've already won. Like I said, we migrated to 6-inch. We talked in the February call about how we qualified the 6-inch process, and we're the first in the industry to do that.

This quarter – in my opening comments I talked about how we're ramping temp-comp SAW in Florida. And again, that's for programs we've already won. But we feel pretty good about the capacity we're putting in place in BAW, as well as in SAW. So when I talked about SAW filters in Greensboro, that's really to insource filters that we're buying outside, that over time that will be a margin improvement as well.
Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC
Thanks, Bob. And one for Eric. Eric, when you talk about major drivers like carrier aggregation or diversity receive, can you talk about where we are in some of those adoption curves? How much of the dollar content story are those kind of major applications driving the content story? And how much of that curve do we have left to go?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. That's a good question. I would say, generally, we're still in pretty early innings overall, in addition to the transition to CA, which – you know, half, let's say, of the 4G phones overall this year will have CA. And eventually, I'm confident, they'll all have it over the next three years to five years. In China alone as well, we think somewhere like a quarter to a third of even the Chinese 4G phones will have carrier aggregation in the downlink this year. So I think overall, we're still in fairly early innings.
Remember, I think we talked about this at Analyst Day, it's a compounding effect of those with the reduced number of SKUs in the handset manufacturers' pipeline that drives the complexity up dramatically. And so that overall trend as well, we definitely see our number two and number three customer in particular driving towards more of a global SKU like our largest customer does. And that also is still in the early innings of development.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Please go ahead.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Yes. Congrats again on outperforming other smartphone suppliers. You talked about reference design exposure in China, places like MediaTek. What about trends towards captive basebands, Xiaomei and Huawei? Are there any implications here on RF Flex and RF Fusion? Thanks.
James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products
Sure. Generally speaking, when you look at the value chain, the more basebands the better, from an RF guy's perspective, right? And so we like that. And in general, we're able to – we take common – to make the products that we're developing relatively common in terms of platforms. And then we can make relatively minor adjustments to customize for each individual, baseband platform or end customer.
We don't see any of the vertical baseband guys looking to develop a completely new RF architecture, for example, right? And we're already addressing those architectures that our customers fundamentally want. So now it's only a matter of interfacing to those individual basebands. Relatively straightforward thing to do. And we're happy to do it. Doing very, very well with all the internal vertical suppliers.
Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC
Okay. So a bit of a neutral. Thanks. And then my follow-up is, you know, really nice June quarter guidance, $50 million of new revenues, flat gross margins. Just wondering about the earnings fall-through. I mean, is it really variable compensation coming back? Or are there some other factors getting to the EPS guidance? Thanks.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Good question. We do expect variable comp to come back. That will lead to OpEx in the low-$150s million kind of range, maybe in the mid-$150s million, depending on the magnitude. It's unusual that we did not pay over the last six-month period, and so you do see kind of a contrast there, and I want to make it clear to folks to expect that. Otherwise, we did improve gross margins sequentially. A lot of that was due to yield differences. And then you have a bit more mobile in the mix, typically, in the June quarter. So all that leads to a guide of 50% gross margin.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. You talked a lot about your China customers up in June. Maybe you could just talk about trends at your two largest customers, what you're embedding into that June guidance?
And then, Steve, I just wanted to follow-up on the OpEx. You said put GreenPeak in September. What's the visibility to the close date, I think you said within the quarter. And any guidance as to what to add in the September quarter? Or would you rather just leave it out?
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, with respect to GreenPeak, it just closed a few days ago, so we'll have some fractional impact in the quarter, and we'll report that when we report the results of this quarter. But from an earnings perspective, consider it de minimis either way. And then you're right, I would prefer to talk about GreenPeak financially when we guide the September quarter.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
And Blayne, as far as our two largest customers, I'm not sure you know who they are. I know you clearly know who the largest one is, so I want to be careful. We're kind of splitting hairs maybe on this, but clearly our largest customer, we're being conservative in our guidance. We do believe it's down to maybe flat. We'll just see.
They've got some pretty good selling products that we've got nice dollar content in, so down to flat for our largest – second largest depending on which one of those you pick. One's going to be down slightly and one's going to be up, so I gave you the top three. How's that?
Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.
I appreciate it. I guess the two largest in March. Obviously it changes, but yes. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Arcuri from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Thanks a lot. I guess the first question is, can you give us some sense in fiscal 2016 maybe what the percentage of your Mobile revenues came from Chinese OEMs?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Over the last year in total – are you including Huawei as a Chinese OEM or do you consider that global?
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Include them.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah, so on the range of – Mobile business on the range of 40% probably including Huawei.
Timothy Arcuri - Cowen & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. And then second question is on the share repo. You bought back 10 million shares in March. I know that some of that's going to spill over into June from kind of how it flows through the P&L, but you said that you're only going to buy back 500,000 shares in June which is down a lot. And that's still not even working through the $250 million that you have left on the repo, so I'm wondering why you're cranking down the repo so much in June. Is that related to the stock price? Or is there something else happening there? Thanks.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, a couple things. The ASR that we initiated was initiated mid-quarter of the March quarter, and so we paid Bank of America $500 million, they tendered about 10 million shares to us. And since share count for a quarter is based on the average for that quarter, we get about half credit this quarter, half credit next quarter.
Now the next point: the ASR is not finished yet. Our partner Bank of America is completing that program this quarter, and exact share count tender will depend on the average share price that we end up with. So our estimate is we'll pick up another half million shares or so as that program comes to completion. Once that program is complete, our board will evaluate whether to proceed with a subsequent buyback utilizing the remaining $250 million previously authorized.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Atif Malik from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi, thanks for taking my question and good job on the execution in the March quarter. Both questions for Steve. On the gross margin, you're guiding flat gross margins on 7% sequential revenue growth. How should we think about your long-term target model of 55%? Has anything changed on that? And then I have a follow-up for Eric.
Steven J. Buhaly - Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, I think the big drivers for us getting from where we're at, which is roughly 50% to our long-term model of 55% are really those big movers in the gross margin line we referred to earlier, moving BAW filters from 6-inch wafers to 8-inch wafers, SAW and TC-SAW from 4-inch to 6-inch. Both of those have an effect of taking roughly a third of the costs out of the die for BAW filters and SAW and TC-SAW filters, very significant reductions.
We'll be consolidating our gas production into a single foundry over the next year and a half, insourcing, assembling tests for part of our Mobile business, the part that used to be – belonged to TriQuint, and each of these have a significant impact which is largely going to be felt in FY 2018. These will occur throughout the year, but the financial impact will be mostly in FY 2018, and then we also simply have the scale benefits of the kind of growth I referenced earlier. We have a fair amount of fixed costs, and we will see scale benefits as we continue to grow to the market at what we expect will be a 10% to 15% rate.
So, I'm actually – short-term, I think we're going to fluctuate around, depending on the particulars of the quarter, but long-term, these are big, substantial items that don't involve new laws of physics. This is stuff we can do. We're well underway, and I think we are on track to get to the target model over time.
Atif Malik - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. And then a follow-up for Eric. Eric, is it possible for you to quantify what percentage of the bands that are getting aggregated globally are using BAW or FBAR type filters?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Well, that's a pretty tough thing to do, actually, other than to say it's growing as a percentage of the total. It's substantial and growing, but that would be a really hard thing to do, looking at all the different band combinations that we're addressing across so many different platforms. But obviously, it's meaningful today. You can tell that by the investments and what's happening in the industry and it's continuing to grow.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
And there's no question, it's probably the highest growth rate area of our business right now, are the high frequency premium filters. We're doing very, very well.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. And even if you look at our Wi-Fi growth, which is – we haven't talked about that today at all, but we're also seeing very strong growth in our Fusion module for Wi-Fi, and that's primarily coming from customers that were doing chip-on-board implementations where they were using our BAW filter but maybe somebody else's FEM. And we've integrated all that together. So when you look at what the TAM or the addressable market effect is, of the BAW filters, it can be quite big.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I was hoping if you could elaborate a little bit more on your new GaN design win. Does it relate at all to the power amplifier market for base station? And overall, when do you expect revenue for these wins to start kicking in? And overall, what do you see as the potential revenue opportunity?

James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products
So, several questions in there again, but good design wins in both the commercial and defense business, both power amplifiers, and yes, on the commercial side it is towards the base station. Not just design wins, but we have production orders in the books. And we are shipping into both of those markets today. Overall size of the market, I think the way I would say it is that market, we model it growing at about 25% year-over-year. We're the market leader there today, and I think we'll continue to grow at that rate and potentially even a little bit higher.
Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Thanks. And in the past you've said your IDP division is roughly an even split between defense, connectivity, transport, and wireless infrastructure. Is that still the case? And do you guys have any insight as to the relative growth rates of each of these sub-segments?
James L. Klein - President-Infrastructure & Defense Products
So, yeah, again, this is James. The relative size. I think that's still a good estimate, that it's broken into those four areas and relatively the same size. And the growth rates, as we've talked about before, probably single-digits or so, high-single-digits in defense. Our connectivity business or Wi-Fi business we see growing close to that 20% range. That's what the market's doing. And those are really probably the big drivers in the business.
I will say that with moving our portfolio around we've repositioned into really some significant high growth areas. We've moved about 60% of the business into what we consider above average growth markets, and those are markets that are growing in the 20% kind of range.
The addition of GreenPeak really substantially helps that. GreenPeak's markets targeted to grow at about 60% between now and 2020, and so very high growth as we move into the connected home and really start to see IoT take off.
Operator
Thank you. The next question come from Edward Snyder from Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead.
Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
Thanks a lot. Eric, Samsung came in a bit better than expected this quarter. I know you guys gained content, but they broke through the 10% barrier here. Was that better content than you expected, a better mix of SKU sales for them, or just higher units overall? And then how do you see things trending at Samsung, not so much on the GS7, but do you expect to continue gaining content above and beyond what you saw in the GS7 in the second half or 2017 with Samsung?
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Hey, this is Bob. As far as Samsung in the quarter, they played out just exactly how we expected it. So we expected to gain the content. We talked about it in last quarter's conference call and it pretty much played out. As far as things go in the future, I'll let Eric address that.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. Thanks.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
Mine was easy, it was already done.
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Samsung is really not unlike the rest of our customers, Ed. We have the same opportunities there working across multiple baseband solutions in their portfolio to really optimize the RF front-ends to cover more and more capabilities going forward.
So when you look at the unique things we're bringing from a tuning and advanced envelope tracking power management, the full suite of BAW filters and so forth, the ability to integrate all of those into really highly compact solutions, I think Samsung is really just like all the other customers from the mid-tier all up to the highest tiers marquee smartphones where we have the opportunities to help them really do a lot more with higher performance in smaller space. So yeah, we think our opportunities there continue to get better.

Edward F. Snyder - Charter Equity Research, Inc.
Yeah. But on the highly integrated module, Skyworks offers that, too, and they've had some success. So what I'm trying to get to here is how much of what you've just experienced at Samsung is due to their SKU reduction moving to these high density modules from more of a regional, discrete architecture versus say gaining traction because you've got BAW, you've got nearly every technology that anybody could want, versus either Avago or Skyworks, and it may lead to just straight up content gains. I'm trying to get a feel for where that falls on the current performance and then what you're seeing – because you see the roadmap out for at least a year now – how does that look for the next two phone?
Steven Eric Creviston - President-Mobile Products
Yeah. That's what I was trying to address. I think we are well familiar with the content gains that we're seeing that's driving the overall industry to 10% to 15% growth. Because of the SKU consolidation, CMOS and so-forth. So I tried to highlight at the beginning, the things that we are maybe differentiated in where we're bringing something in addition to that.
Tuning is a big area across our entire customer portfolio now where we really see that growing and we've got a lot of leadership there in bringing new solutions and envelope tracking power management as well. We're the only open-market solution for that. And we're seeing a lot of traction driving there. So, in addition to those fundamental drivers, we think Qorvo does bring a lot of unique things as well. That really helps us.
Operator
Thank you. So that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to send the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.
Robert A. Bruggeworth - President & Chief Executive Officer
We'd like to thank each of you for joining us tonight. We're launching an increasing number of highly-integrated RF solutions. We're seeing a return to growth in many of IDP's broad markets and we're excited about the long-term growth outlook for the RF market. We believe our systems-level expertise, integration capabilities, and comprehensive product portfolios of breakthrough RF solutions position us favorably to gain content and drive continued profitable growth. Thank you, and have a good night.
