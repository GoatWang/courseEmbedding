Healthcare - Huron






























 

 










Healthcare
In this time of transformation, how can healthcare organizations thrive?
Transformation is under way across all aspects of the healthcare industry — from demands for greater transparency around the quality and cost of care, to rising consumer influence and increasing pressures to manage regulatory volatility. There is also the pressing need to engage and empower physicians and other healthcare professionals while simultaneously finding ways to work with an increasing number of new partners, build population health models, embrace new payment structures and leverage technology.
As the intensity of these changes continues to mount in speed and scale, how can health systems, hospitals, physician groups and insurers truly advance and lead?
At Huron, our consultants are committed to helping healthcare organizations successfully evolve and adapt. Together, we can turn these nuanced complexities into opportunities that drive local differentiation, immediate gains and long-term success. We help develop and implement the right strategies to accomplish complex goals, including effectively transitioning to population health, managing the total costs of care, pursuing aligned payment models, appropriately leveraging scale, rationalizing business structures, embracing the right technologies and aligning organizational priorities. We empower business and clinical leadership talent for the simultaneous worlds of fee-for-service and value-based care.
Having worked with the majority of leading healthcare organizations, we have the proven ability to identify and solve strategic, organizational and operational challenges so our clients can be market leaders and deliver exceptional patient care and experience. Our decades of combined industry experience ensure we can best guide clients to select the right strategic options. Ultimately our shared goal is to improve clinical, financial and human performance to achieve long-term success, so they in turn can better deliver on their mission to service the community.

MACRA & Payment Reform
The path to value presents conflicting requirements and the need to build business and financial stability today while visioning and implementing a plan to realize growth. Many providers are at this crossroad, determining if their organization is ready to take risk and which models make the most sense - all while figuring out how to succeed under Medicare's new fee-for-performance payment regime.
To help you effectively shift and grow, our experts have developed educational resources, policy updates and strategic perspectives.

Clinical Laboratory Services
Unprecedented industry transformation is forcing both standalone clinical laboratories and those in hospitals and health systems to take a hard look at their operational efficiencies and financial performance.

 Optimize staffing, equipment, space or technologies to enhance productivity and reduce costs. 
 Reduce variation in service delivery while maintaining quality and compliance. 
 Review contracts and assess capital purchases, information technology and other significant investments.
 Optimize patient blood management and test utilization initiatives.
 Provide strategic direction for laboratory consolidations that consider all aspects of clinical operations.
 Expand outreach lab capabilities and grow market share.
 Improve their fiscal viability, from billing to connectivity to courier services, to sales and marketing strategies. 
 Consider divesting or improving their valuation for potential sale or merger.

Seeing strategy through to action requires deep industry knowledge, executional experience and original insights. It also requires us to think about where you are today, where you need to go in the future and how we can get you there.
Huron’s team of trusted strategic advisors brings the diversity of experience and resources needed to help laboratories create ﬂexible, financial and operational management strategies that yield sustainable results.

Our Healthcare Customers' Markets


                            Academic Medical Centers
                            


                                            Academic Medical Centers
                                            

Academic Medical Centers
With the evolution of medical education and research, higher education funding shortfalls and massive industry transformation are creating unique challenges for academic medical centers (AMCs). Adding to these pressures is the perception that AMCs are more expensive – impacting consumer care selection and making payer negotiations challenging. Most at risk are AMCs that operate in urban areas and treat a high number of uninsured and Medicaid patients. Funding cuts for disproportionate share hospitals are rising at an alarming rate. 
These constraints make it difficult for AMCs to operate profitably. In response, many are designing and deploying new business strategies, consolidating, partnering with other local providers, diversifying their funding sources and curtailing operational costs. 
Navigating this journey can be daunting. That’s why Huron built an advisory team of former AMC leaders, higher education professionals and trusted strategists to help AMCs realize and maintain exceptional financial and operational performance. We leverage our depth of expertise and diversity of experience from working with 95 of the top 100 research universities to drive market-leading results. We work hand-in-hand with AMC leaders to deliver rapid, proven and sustainable outcomes. 





                            Community Hospitals
                            


                                            Community Hospitals
                                            

Community Hospitals
In today’s turbulent healthcare environment, community hospitals struggle to remain independent because of declining profit margins, changes in reimbursement models and reduced inpatient volumes. Whether fighting for their sovereignty or entering into strategic affiliations, hospitals must enhance value in every aspect of their operations. 
Together with the Studer Group, our advisors work with community hospitals to drive sustainable improvements. We work hand-in-hand with leaders at all levels to uncover insights, embed leadership, set new directions, reduce complexities and facilitate operational efficiencies. We also evaluate revenue cycle, clinical and support services as well as potential strategic partnerships to help community hospitals realize and maintain exceptional performance and organization-wide engagement.

                                            Government Healthcare Organizations
                                            

Government Healthcare Organizations
Healthcare reform and shifting public policies are stressing our nation's city, county and state-run public health systems and institutions. Funding shortfalls, cuts to disproportionate share reimbursement, Medicaid program alterations and changing patient demographics also are overcrowding emergency departments, trauma centers and clinics.
At the federal level, organizations like the Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense, and Indian Health Services are working diligently to optimize the quality of care they deliver. 
Navigating these challenges, while designing flexible and sustainable strategies with fewer resources, is no small task. Huron and Studer Group partner with various government health entities to optimize clinical and business operations and drive organization-wide engagement. Our team has extensive expertise in performance improvement, document and expense management, organizational change management review, formal risk management planning and executive and leadership coaching. Our unparalleled experience and flexible implementation plans can help public and government healthcare institutions realize and maintain exceptional performance as well as build a sustainable culture.

Medical Groups
Medical groups are the “front door” to your health system and are often the critical first encounter that patients have with your healthcare system. For each inpatient visit, there are 20 visits to affiliated medical groups, which greatly strains operators and providers. Unlocking the potential of both employed and independent medical groups is critical for thriving in a value-based world. Together with Studer Group, we have a long, rich history of partnering with medical groups of all sizes to achieve sustainable change through improving operational performance and driving organization-wide engagement. 
As value-based care models increasingly link patient experience and clinical outcomes to reimbursement, health systems and affiliated medical groups need to improve quality of care scores on performance measures. Our transformation team has the strategic, operational and clinical experience to guide this transition. Our consulting and coaching capabilities create the accountability and change management strategies needed for long-term, sustainable success.

                                            National and Regional Health Systems
                                            

National and Regional Health Systems
Radical industry transformation is significantly impacting America’s national and regional health systems. Mergers, acquisitions and sell-offs are constant so the very composition of these systems, their value propositions and economies of scale and scope are ever changing. Additionally, the changes in regulations and laws impact how these systems deliver care and to whom, as well as how they are compensated. Specifically, national and regional health systems are grappling with different ways to:

Manage workforce planning and clinical operations
Integrate technologies to drive safer, efficient and more affordable healthcare
Improve both personalized and population health

To endure, many of today’s integrated delivery networks are consolidating, forging unprecedented partnerships, cutting costs and leveraging economies of scale – all of which can be difficult to achieve quickly or easily.
That’s where Huron and Studer Group come in. Our trusted strategic advisors help systems navigate these challenges by applying their depth of expertise and diversity of experience when and where it is needed most. We work hand-in-hand with health systems to facilitate lasting and sustainable improvements by creating strategies that are data-driven, analytics-enabled and experienced-based to realize and maintain exceptional performance.





                            Specialty Hospitals and Facilities
                            


                                            Specialty Hospitals and Facilities
                                            

Specialty Hospitals and Facilities
Major changes in reimbursement led by Medicare and Medicaid are challenging the delivery of care as well as the roles and structure of specialty hospitals and facilities. These institutions also face a shortfall of specialty providers, increased competition from emerging national and regional and national systems, cuts to vital research funding and decreasing revenue sources to offer preventive care. 
 Our partnerships with specialty hospital customers include:

 Behavioral hospitals
 Children's hospitals
 Cancer centers 
 Post-acute care providers and facilities
 Rehabilitation facilities
Surgical centers

Sustaining specialty hospitals and facilities requires a different way of thinking. It also requires deep expertise in clinical and operations management, revenue cycle optimization (particularly in states with Medicaid diagnosis-related groups) as well as managing resources based on fluctuating demand. With specialty care involving a variety of medically complex services, special attention also must be paid to the intricacies of the insurance verification processes. 
Huron’s record of success with specialty healthcare providers is unmatched. Our team of trusted advisors can help these entities improve operating performance, cultural knowledge and financial strength.

Enterprise Solutions & Analytics - Huron






























 

 










Enterprise Solutions & Analytics
Is it possible to succeed in market conditions undergoing rapid change?
Success hinges on the relationships companies have with their customers and their ability to make insightful business decisions that deliver value. But in constantly evolving industries, these decisions are harder to make, and changes more difficult to manage. The accuracy of a company’s underlying, enterprise-wide systems that support these decisions, as well as compliance and risk protection data, become essential for their future success. As is a deep understanding of a company’s nuanced set of stakeholders, existing governance and processes, and customer relationships.
With seemingly endless options and questions to consider, how can companies choose the right technology and path forward?
At Huron, we understand the complexities of the competitive landscape and statutory regulations facing our clients. That is why we work in partnership with global executives to address the challenging realities they face. Whether that is through Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Performance Management (EPM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or business analytics, we optimize financial performance, achieve operational efficiency, and improve the customer experience. 
As a leader of cloud implementations, we have significant Oracle and Salesforce expertise and are the largest and fastest-growing EPM firm in North America. But we don’t stop there. We continue to challenge ourselves and our clients to adapt and evolve. Because as change is always in motion, so are we.

Financial Restatement[edit]
On July 31, 2009, Huron announced that the company would restate its financial statements for 2006, 2007, 2008, and first quarter 2009.[20] That same day, Huron announced the resignation of its Chairman of the Board and CEO Gary Holdren, CFO Gary Burge, and that Chief Accounting Officer Wayne Lipski would soon be departing.[21] The company also announced that James H. Roth, a founder of the company, would be Huron's new CEO. The following business day - August 3, 2009 - Huron’s shares dropped 69 percent to $13.69.[22] The company had reported that shareholders of four Huron business acquisitions, acquired between 2005 and 2007, conditionally redistributed portions of their initial and future acquisition-related payments among themselves and to certain Huron employees without Huron's knowledge or permission. The issue was initially identified by the Chief Accounting Officer/Controller, Wayne Lipski.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
