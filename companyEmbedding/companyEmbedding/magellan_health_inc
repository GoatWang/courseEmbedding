Accreditation & Certification
Industry Accreditations


Industry Accreditations
National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) 
NCQA is a national organization that accredits both Managed Behavioral Health Organizations (MBHOs) and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). Magellan leads the industry in NCQA accreditation and is uniquely positioned to work with MCO customers to take full advantage of new NCQA standards and guidelines. 

Magellan has more sites with NCQA Full Accreditations than any other MBHO.
Magellan was instrumental in helping NCQA shape its MBHO accreditation program by providing NCQA with extensive feedback on draft standards and hosting pilot corporate and site reviews.
Magellan was the first MBHO to complete a corporate survey in which scores were received that apply to sites' surveys.
Magellan's quality improvement program to reduce inpatient mental health readmissions was selected by NCQA for inclusion in its benchmarking publication, Quality Profiles. Magellan was the first MBHO to have a program included in this publication.

American Accreditation Health Care Commission/URAC 
34 Magellan sites have been granted "Full Re-Accreditation" by the American Accreditation Health Care Commission under the Health Utilization Management Standards. URAC accreditation is an indication that a managed care organization has the necessary structures and processes to promote high quality care and preserve patient rights. 

Magellan has had sites accredited by URAC since 1992.
Magellan holds more URAC Accreditations for Health Utilization Management than any other MBHO. 
Magellan was the first MBHO to be accredited under URAC's Case Management standards.

Council on Accreditation (COA)/Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) 
Magellan has full four-year Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Accreditation from the Council on Accreditation (COA) in conjunction with the Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA). Magellan is the first and only managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) to have this distinction. Magellan is also one of one of only six EAP vendors in the US and Canada to hold joint accreditation with EASNA and COA. In fact, Magellan helped COA in the development of these standards by participating in the beta rollout of the program in 2000.
The accreditation recognizes Magellan Health Services for meeting rigorous standards for professional performance in the delivery of high quality EAP services. Magellan's full four-year COA accreditation for EAP services runs through January of 2007. 



Magellan's 11 three-year-full NCQA-accredited sites include: 
California
Eastern Pennsylvania
Georgia
Illinios
King of Prussia
Massachusetts/Rhode Island
Mid-Atlantic
Michigan
New Jersey
Ohio
Texas

The information is used as defined herein. As a standard practice, as described below, we collect general statistical information on the content viewed, which is used to help us provide better service to you.

Email
Please note that individualized information transmitted via email correspondence between you and Magellan —as opposed to transmission over Magellan’s website—is not encrypted. As a result, like most, if not all, non-encrypted internet email communications, such email correspondence may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge and permission while in transit. For that reason, to protect your privacy, if you have concerns about  treatment, or questions that would involve the communication of confidential/personal health information, please call your physician or other healthcare professional,  Magellan representative  provided in your plan “Welcome Package” (or  supervisor where applicable).  All users of secure sign-in websites are required to use a user ID and password to further protect privacy. It is very important not to share with or give your user ID or password to anyone, and also give thought to any person(s) who may have access to your account.
You agree that any comments, suggestions or other information sent to Magellan by way of this site is provided without restriction or obligation on Magellan and Magellan will be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis. You also agree

That information submitted is at your own risk.
Magellan has no liability with respect to any unauthorized access by third parties
You are responsible for whatever material you submit, and
You, not Magellan, have full responsibility for any submitted message, including its legality, reliability, appropriateness, originality, and copyright.

Electronic or hard copies of the information captured through this website system may be archived or retained in Magellan files or systems. Information from emails may be transcribed into other Magellan systems such as a calls database.
Where sign-in is required to access a website, email addresses are collected as part of the registration process for the website.

Magellan does not share your email information with third parties other than for providing service to you.
Security
A range of security features protects the privacy of any individualized information you provide over a secure sign-in to the Magellan website. During transmission over a secure sign-in website, your privacy is protected by 128-bit encryption security. Other security safeguards are also in place.
Magellan uses physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect any personally identifiable data stored on its computers. Only authorized employees and third parties have access to the information you provide to Magellan for providing service to you.
Linked sites
Magellan’s website has links to various other websites that we think might be useful or of interest to you. Magellan, however, cannot be responsible for and does not endorse the privacy practices or the content of its linked websites. Magellan urges you to review the privacy policies of any websites you visit once you leave Magellan’s website.

Policy is subject to change

Each time you visit this website or any Magellan website it is your responsibility to review the most current Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions , Disclaimer  and any other policies, restrictions, conditions and notices on this website or any Magellan website and by accessing, browsing, and/or using this website or any Magellan website, you accept and agree to be bound by the most current Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, Disclaimer and any other policies, restrictions, conditions and notices on this website or such other Magellan website.

Accreditation & Certification
Industry Accreditations


Industry Accreditations
National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) 
NCQA is a national organization that accredits both Managed Behavioral Health Organizations (MBHOs) and Managed Care Organizations (MCOs). Magellan leads the industry in NCQA accreditation and is uniquely positioned to work with MCO customers to take full advantage of new NCQA standards and guidelines. 

Magellan has more sites with NCQA Full Accreditations than any other MBHO.
Magellan was instrumental in helping NCQA shape its MBHO accreditation program by providing NCQA with extensive feedback on draft standards and hosting pilot corporate and site reviews.
Magellan was the first MBHO to complete a corporate survey in which scores were received that apply to sites' surveys.
Magellan's quality improvement program to reduce inpatient mental health readmissions was selected by NCQA for inclusion in its benchmarking publication, Quality Profiles. Magellan was the first MBHO to have a program included in this publication.

American Accreditation Health Care Commission/URAC 
34 Magellan sites have been granted "Full Re-Accreditation" by the American Accreditation Health Care Commission under the Health Utilization Management Standards. URAC accreditation is an indication that a managed care organization has the necessary structures and processes to promote high quality care and preserve patient rights. 

Magellan has had sites accredited by URAC since 1992.
Magellan holds more URAC Accreditations for Health Utilization Management than any other MBHO. 
Magellan was the first MBHO to be accredited under URAC's Case Management standards.

Council on Accreditation (COA)/Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA) 
Magellan has full four-year Employee Assistance Program (EAP) Accreditation from the Council on Accreditation (COA) in conjunction with the Employee Assistance Society of North America (EASNA). Magellan is the first and only managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) to have this distinction. Magellan is also one of one of only six EAP vendors in the US and Canada to hold joint accreditation with EASNA and COA. In fact, Magellan helped COA in the development of these standards by participating in the beta rollout of the program in 2000.
The accreditation recognizes Magellan Health Services for meeting rigorous standards for professional performance in the delivery of high quality EAP services. Magellan's full four-year COA accreditation for EAP services runs through January of 2007. 



Magellan's 11 three-year-full NCQA-accredited sites include: 
California
Eastern Pennsylvania
Georgia
Illinios
King of Prussia
Massachusetts/Rhode Island
Mid-Atlantic
Michigan
New Jersey
Ohio
Texas

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
