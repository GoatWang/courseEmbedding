NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--KKR Income Opportunities Fund (the “Fund”) (NYSE:KIO) today announced 
      its monthly distributions of $0.125 per common share, payable on the

      amount and dividing it by the IPO share price or current price, as the 
      case may be).

      The fund will hold its quarterly investor call on Wednesday, August 30, 
      2017 at 4:00pm ET. Co-head of Leveraged Credit, Chris Sheldon, will host 
      the call.
    

      The call may be accessed by dialing 1-877-883-0383, passcode: 1789473. A 
      replay of the live broadcast will be available by dialing 
      1-877-344-7529, passcode: 10111004, approximately one hour after the 
      call.
    

Information regarding the distribution rate is included for 
      informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of future 
      results, the achievement of which cannot be assured. The distribution 
      rate should not be considered the yield or total return on an investment 
      in the Fund.


      In compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a 
      notice will be provided to shareholders for any distribution that does 
      not consist solely of net investment income. A portion of each 
      distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net 
      investment income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, 
      long-term capital gain or return of capital.
    

      The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are 
      only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. 
      The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2017 will 
      be made after year-end. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the 
      calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for 
      federal income tax purposes.
    

      The Fund is a diversified, closed-end fund. Investors should consider 
      the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully 
      before investing.
    

      The investment return, price, yields, market value and net asset value 
      (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. 
      Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their NAV, which may 
      increase an investor’s risk of loss. There is no assurance that the Fund 
      will meet its investment objective. The Fund’s distribution rate may be 
      affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and 
      projected market returns, Fund performance, and other factors. There can 
      be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will 
      not result in a change in a Fund distribution rate at a future time.
    

      An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is 
      not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed 
      as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investors should 
      carefully review and consider the Fund’s investment objective, risk, 
      charges and expenses before investing.
    

      Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and it is possible 
      to lose money by investing in the Fund. Past performance is not a 
      guarantee of future results. Please see the Fund’s prospectus for more 
      risk information.

      for additional information.


The Fund will invest in loans and other types of fixed‐income 
      instruments and securities. Such investments may be secured, partially 
      secured or unsecured and may be unrated, and whether or not rated, may 
      have speculative characteristics. The market price of the Fund’s 
      investments will change in response to changes in interest rates and 
      other factors. Generally, when interest rates rise, the values of 
      fixed‐income instruments fall, and vice versa.


Use of leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and 
      return for Common Shareholders but, at the same time, creates risks, 
      including the likelihood of greater volatility in the NAV and market 
      price of, and distributions on, the Common Shares. In particular, 
      leverage may magnify interest rate risk, which is the risk that the 
      prices of portfolio securities will fall (or rise) if market interest 
      rates for those types of securities rise (or fall). As a result, 
      leverage may cause greater changes in the Fund’s NAV, which will be 
      borne entirely by the Fund’s Common Shareholders.


Derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect 
      correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying 
      assets of the Fund. The risk of loss from a short sale is unlimited 
      because the Fund must purchase the shorted security at a higher price to 
      complete the transaction and there is no upper limit for the security 
      price. The use of options, swaps, and derivatives by the Fund has the 
      potential to significantly increase the Fund’s volatility. In addition 
      to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments 
      may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in 
      currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting 
      principles or from social, economic or political instability in other 
      nations. The Fund’s investments in securities or other instruments of 
      non‐U.S. issuers or borrowers may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient 
      and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility and 
      changes in value.

* The distribution is expected to be paid from net investment income (regular interest and dividends). The final tax characterization of the dividend may differ substantially from this preliminary information, which is based on estimates, and the final characterization of such much amount will be determined in early part of the following calendar year. If necessary, the Fund will pay an adjusting distribution in December that includes any additional income and net realized capital gains in excess of the monthly distributions for that year to satisfy the minimum distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. In January or February of each year, investors will be sent a Form 1099-DIV for the previous calendar year that will define how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.

KKR Income Opportunities Fund Portfolio Information Now Available


 Previous Release | Next Release 





September 17 / 2013

File is in Briefcase






 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      KKR Income Opportunities Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE:KIO) today announced

      that its portfolio holdings information as of August 31, 2013 is now

      available at www.kkrfunds.com/kio

      by clicking on Portfolio Holdings.

    


      The Fund is a newly organized, non-diversified, closed-end management

      investment company with no operating history. Investors should consider

      the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully

      before investing.

    


      The investment return, price, yields, market value and net asset value

      (NAV) of the Fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions.

      Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their NAV, which may

      increase an investor's risk of loss. There is no assurance that the Fund

      will meet its investment objectives.

    


      An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is

      not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed

      as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investors should

      carefully review and consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks,

      charges and expenses before investing.

    


      Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and it is possible

      to lose money by investing in the Fund. Past performance is not a

      guarantee of future results. Please see the Fund's prospectus for more

      risk information.

    

Forward Looking Statements



      This press release contains certain statements that may include

      "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal

      securities laws. All statements, other than statements of historical

      fact, included herein are "forward-looking statements." The

      forward-looking statements are based on the Fund's and KKR's beliefs,

      assumptions and expectations of its future performance, taking into

      account all information currently available to it. These beliefs,

      assumptions and expectations can change as a result of many possible

      events or factors, not all of which are known to the Fund or KKR or are

      within their control. The Fund and KKR do not undertake any obligation

      to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or

      events that occur after the date on which such statements were made

      except as required by law.

    

This document is not an offer to sell securities and is not

      soliciting an offer to buy securities in any jurisdiction where the

      offer or sale is not permitted.

      targeted portfolio of loans and fixed-income instruments of U.S. and

      non-U.S. issuers and implementing hedging strategies in order to seek to

      achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.

KKR Income Opportunities Fund seeks to dynamically allocate across credit instruments to capitalize on changes in relative value among corporate credit investments and manage against macroeconomic risks. The Fund is designed to offer investors:

Investment experience of KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, the Fund’s investment adviser, which is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., a leading global investment firm with a 40-year history of leadership, innovation and investment excellence
Potential for attractive levels of current income through monthly distributions
A targeted portfolio investing primarily in bank loans and high yield securities
KKR Credit's consistent approach and robust credit investment process that seeks to adapt credit strategies to market conditions

KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC serves as KKR Income Opportunities Fund’s investment adviser (the “Adviser”). Launched in 2004, the Adviser is a subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with the Adviser and its other affiliates, “KKR”). The Adviser’s investment teams, which are organized by industry, invest across the capital structure with the goal of achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns and protecting capital. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives of seeking a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation will be achieved or that the Fund’s investment program will be successful.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.

Leverage involves the use of various financial instruments or borrowings in an attempt to increase the return of an investment.

For additional risk information, see the “Leverage” section of the prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
