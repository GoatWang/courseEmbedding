All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them. - Walt Disney


In a perfect world, your money would manage itself. But it's not a perfect world and that's why we're here to help you accomplish your investment goals.
We specialize in providing sound, personalized investment management services to high net-worth individuals, as well as to foundations, endowments, corporations, non-profit organizations, and retirement plans.
But what truly sets us apart from other asset managers is our approach: people before portfolios. You are a unique individual — shouldn't your investment strategy reflect that? So before we get to know your money we get to know you. We create a personal relationship. Together we determine your goals, then assess your circumstances and factor in your investment objectives and risk tolerance.
Foothills Asset Management is a fee-only registered investment advisor. That means we don't sell products or derive income from commissions. Our compensation comes solely from the total market value of your assets. Simply put, we align our interests with yours. When you do well, we do well.

process



We can't help everyone, but everyone can help someone. - Ronald Reagan


Ever wonder what happened to the days when money managers would stick with the fundamentals, even if it meant straying from the crowd? While Wall Street often pushes what sells today, we follow a path that makes sense for you.
The philosophy behind our investment strategy is simple: we buy shares of good companies at reasonable prices relative to their long-term growth prospects. Equity portfolios consist primarily of individual stocks, complimented by mutual funds or exchange traded funds. When appropriate, we incorporate fixed income investments (bonds or bond funds) that provide you with current income. Additionally, they cushion your portfolio during the inevitable periods of weakness in the stock market. We do not sell investment products or receive income from commissions — so our investment decisions are never biased by conflicts of interest.
But the Foothills attention to detail goes beyond the investment process. Our dedicated staff strives to ensure your experience is always a positive one, from making it easy to access your account to simply lending an ear if you need to chat. At Foothills, we treat you like a member of our own family—and we invest your money the same way.

Background Information:


Foothills Asset Management Ltd. »
FAM's equity approach is to buy shares of good businesses at reasonable prices relative to their prospects for long-term growth. They continually evaluate common stocks as though they were buying direct ownership interests in these companies. The specific mix of securities depends upon the client's tolerance for risk, need for current income and the length of time that assets will be invested. They concentrate on four characteristics of a good business: (1) consistent earnings growth (2) strong balance sheets (3) excess free cash flow (more cash than is required to operate the business on a daily basis) and (4) better than average return on assets used in the business (the return on equity). By focusing on these characteristics, their database of companies listed on the stock exchanges narrows from about 11,000 to around 4,400.  FAM then applies their proprietary research screening model allowing them to focus on a subset of approximately 350 companies for potential investment. The firm may sell a stock for any of the following reasons (1) the shares of a company significantly exceed our price target (2) the value of a position becomes disproportionately large relative to the overall portfolio or (3) a significant deterioration or change in the fundamentals of the company takes place.FAM is an 'active' fixed-income manager. They continually look for opportunities to improve returns by making timely changes to the duration and credit quality of the securities in a portfolio. They often take advantage of anomalies in the debt markets in order to enhance both the yield and total return of bond portfolios. They believe that the duration of a bond is a measure of the volatility of that security and is the single most important factor for a fixed-income investor to consider.  The bond market is subdivided into several sectors. These sectors include government, government agency, corporate and municipal bonds. FAM continually monitors the relationships among these sectors to identify the areas that represent the best value. Government bonds tend to perform best during periods of slow economic growth. Corporate bonds perform better as general economic conditions improve. The firm monitors the credit quality of non-government borrowers. Their goal is to avoid bonds with deteriorating credit profiles and identify securities that may experience an upgrade in their ratings.  The objective is to capture incremental yield with little additional risk.
