Thomas Kurian, Oracle’s president of product development, has the task of integrating NetSuite into Oracle’s efforts to expand its cloud-computing offerings.

REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. — It was not all that difficult for the Silicon Valley software giant Oracle to pay $9.3 billion for a company called NetSuite. But then writing big checks has rarely been a problem for Oracle, which over the last 11 years has acquired dozens of companies in its quest to find more and more customers.The hard part is now in the hands of Thomas Kurian, a soft-spoken 49-year-old who has to figure out how the new purchase will work with what Oracle already has.While Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle’s brash executive chairman, is still an outsize personality at the company he co-founded, Mr. Kurian has been the key figure in Oracle’s attempted reinvention, overseeing sweeping changes in its engineering. That includes the creation of a network of 21 data centers around the world, a project that has cost perhaps $15 billion. NetSuite is Oracle’s first major acquisition intended to tie right into this new global system.“Money isn’t the problem for us,” said Mr. Kurian, who is Oracle’s president of product development. He added that “between 2004 and 2014 we spent some $40 billion to $45 billion on acquisitions.”

Oracle became a giant by selling directly to businesses software packages that do things like manage the books and keep track of customers. Now most industry experts think the company needs to show that it is finally in a position to rein in competitors that have been stealing customers away with fresher technology delivered over the internet, a concept called cloud computing.

And the trade-offs Oracle must now make — accepting lower profit margins because customers are less interested in the older, pricier technology — reflect the hard decisions many older tech companies must make to avoid getting left behind.“There’s no doubt Oracle moved late,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. “They had doubts about the business, and the profit margins, but the way companies are spending forced them to change.”Oracle’s new data centers are intended to power a cloud-computing network to compete with the established services provided by the likes of Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. And the NetSuite acquisition could help Oracle pull even with smaller, cloud-focused companies like Salesforce and Workday, which provide their own technology to manage business operations like sales and human resources.Mr. Kurian would seem an unlikely person to play such a key role in one of Silicon Valley’s iconic companies. Born and raised in a middle-class family in Bangalore, India, Mr. Kurian ended his first day in the United States in his freshman dorm room at Princeton University, which he shared with his identical twin, George, who is now chief executive at NetApp, another Silicon Valley company.“The day we left India was the first day we saw a computer,” said George Kurian, who after graduation worked at Oracle while Thomas Kurian was a consultant at McKinsey. The two also went to Stanford Business School together.Mark V. Hurd and Safra A. Catz, both chief executives at Oracle, manage the company’s sales and finance. Mr. Ellison, who is 71 and shows no inclination to retire, counts on Mr. Kurian to run the core of any big tech company: thousands of engineers.The NetSuite deal is something of a coming-out party for Oracle’s global cloud, possibly signaling the start of a new round of acquisitions, along with hefty spending to keep building out this network. But spending upward of $2 billion a year on building a cloud network, Mr. Kurian said, is table stakes for the biggest tech companies.

In NetSuite, Oracle saw a cloud company whose sales of e-commerce and manufacturing software to smaller businesses were stalling as it tried to move into international markets. Oracle figured it could distribute that software efficiently over its cloud. It also hopes to reach smaller companies that can’t afford Oracle’s traditional high-cost, high-maintenance product.

Mr. Ellison played no role in the acquisition of NetSuite, according to Oracle, since he owns about 40 percent of that company. Mr. Ellison, who is already worth $45 billion, according to Bloomberg, will reap another $3.7 billion on the NetSuite deal. He still attends regular corporate strategy sessions, along with Mr. Hurd, Ms. Catz and Mr. Kurian, grilling each on their respective portfolios.Oracle has hundreds of different types of software for businesses, but more than anything it is known for powerful databases. Many global airlines, banks and manufacturers wouldn’t function without them.Customers treat the big, Oracle-strength software like sacred objects that should never be altered, while they’re happy to experiment, for example, with a new offering from Amazon. That’s one reason Oracle has a hard time moving toward new technology, said Steve Miranda, Oracle’s vice president of applications development.“New companies have what is called ‘a minimum viable product’ they can sell,” said Mr. Miranda, a 24-year veteran at Oracle. At his company, Mr. Miranda said, that minimum is in reality a fairly high-end product.Mr. Kurian, who has been at Oracle for 20 years, is known to move quickly in meetings, seeking slides ahead of a presentation and immediately zeroing in on the one slide where he spots a problem. If there are no problems, the meeting is canceled. Soft-spoken or not, he will let rip a profanity-laced tirade if he sees too many problems.“I won’t comment on the language, but we are very honest with each other, very hard on ourselves and very direct,” said Mr. Miranda. “If you’re striving to be the best of the best, it comes with the territory.”As fast as Mr. Kurian moves Oracle down the technology field, the competition keeps moving the goal posts. Soon after the NetSuite deal Thursday, Amazon announced that its cloud business had second-quarter revenue of $2.9 billion. Just the amount Amazon’s cloud segment grew from the previous quarter, $320 million, was $90 million more than all NetSuite’s revenue for the second quarter.Much of that revenue comes from selling bare-bones computing that Oracle doesn’t care about. But increasingly Amazon is offering its own databases, and customers are signing on. It targets Oracle directly at its promotional events, and offers something called “serverless computing,” which charges for applications per line of code rather than monthly fees or upfront licenses — another potential threat to Oracle’s profit margins.

Oracle has built a large operation in Seattle, paying big for cloud talent from Amazon and Microsoft. (Google also has operations there, making Seattle something of the nation’s cloud town.) But local hands there say Oracle isn’t yet a noticeable presence.“Right now, I go to all-day meetings, and their name doesn’t come up,” said Matt McIlwain, a managing director of the Madrona Venture Group, a Seattle venture firm.The next big competition in cloud computing also involves artificial intelligence, fed by loads of data. Soon, Mr. Kurian said, Oracle will offer applications that draw from what it knows about the people whose actions are recorded in Oracle databases. The company has anonymized data from 1,500 companies, including three billion consumers and 400 million business profiles, representing $3 trillion in consumer purchases.“Most of the world’s data is already inside Oracle databases,” said Mr. Kurian.That’s the kind of hold on people’s information that perhaps only Facebook can match. But Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t sell business software. At least, not yet.

SubscribeOracle has made a giant leap forward in software-defined virtual data centers and DevOps-style tooling with its cloud platform. At the same time that Oracle is making these big strategic moves, though, it’s also focused on people—connecting directly with the developer community through a series of gatherings around the world called Oracle Code, to bring a few hundred developers together at a time to share ideas about building modern cloud apps.



Source: Oracle



At the first Oracle Code event, held in San Francisco, President of Product Development Thomas Kurian packed his keynote with demos that showed how Oracle is revamping the cloud.




To kick off this 20-city Oracle Code tour on March 1, Oracle President of Product Development Thomas Kurian offered Oracle’s three-point vision for developers during his keynote at the sold-out event in San Francisco. The vision, according to Kurian:

Oracle platform as a service provides APIs or a GUI for developers to create a software-defined virtual data center that can be up and running in the cloud within minutes, by instantiating compute, storage, and network elements. And developers can bring their own IP address ranges to the cloud to extend their applications and data centers seamlessly to the cloud.
Oracle is providing a complete development platform to automate the software supply chain, allowing developers to focus on their code while the platform administers itself (from installation, patching, and configuration to backing up and encrypting data) using software and machine learning. “We provision the stack, scale it, back it up, encrypt it—we do all those functions,” Kurian said.


Finally, developers can bring their modules of code, and Oracle’s platform as a service takes care of scaling the code and meeting required SLAs without developers having to worry about scaling the underlying infrastructure. “Infrastructure as a service over time becomes invisible because you do not have to worry about the infrastructure your code is being deployed and scaled upon,” Kurian said. “You should be able to deploy every minute or every hour.”


The Oracle Code events are free, and you can sign up for upcoming cities around the world, including New York on March 21 and Washington DC on March 27. The events bring software developers, Oracle partners, and Oracle experts together. In San Francisco, juiced with their Internet-of-Things-brewed artisan coffee, and spilling out of a hands-on lab where they could build a blackjack app using Oracle Cloud, everyone—from Facebook engineers to drone inventors, from data gurus to JavaScript coders—was eager to learn more. 
Kurian packed his keynote with demos that showed how Oracle is revamping the cloud, ranging from how Oracle places its cloud data centers to minimize even disruption from earthquakes, to how developers can make Docker images more discoverable. Kurian also announced: 

An Oracle partnership with Pluralsight for new cloud courses in IaaS foundations, Node.js, and Java
 An updated portal for polyglot developers that adds new educational and thought leadership content
 $300 of free credits to try Oracle Cloud, at oracle.com/tryit

The Software Supply Chain and Open Oracle
The codification of a “software supply chain,” as Kurian put it, offers stunning technical proof that DevOps-style continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) has become mainstream, allowing code to go from development to testing to production in an automated fashion. And still, the demand for Docker-based containerization is only just beginning. “We’re still in early days of container adoption. One of the challenges of having the first show in San Francisco is we’re well and truly inside that bubble here,” said Simon Bennett, vice president of product for Bitnami, an Oracle partner with a booth at the show. Upcoming shows outside Silicon Valley will reveal the challenges typical developers face in the rush to the cloud, he said, noting that Bitnami cofounder and CEO Daniel Ridruejo would be speaking at Oracle Code in Mexico City.
Open source is central to cloud-based development, and so it’s also central to Oracle Code. Following his talk on in-memory analytics using Apache Spark and Hazelcast, an open-source high-density caching data grid, Viktor Gamov confided that he hadn’t expected so much openness from Oracle: “Hazelcast is directly competing with Oracle Coherence, so I was very surprised that I was invited to give a talk here. But it’s not about competition, it’s about giving developers better tools. I didn’t have the chance to run my demo in Oracle Cloud, but I will definitely grab my free cloud credits and do this when I speak at Oracle Code in Austin,” said Gamov, senior solutions architect for Hazelcast, referring to the next Oracle Code event, March 8 in Texas.
 Continuous Delivery in the Cloud Is Hard
 In the Oracle Code Lounge, the booths hummed with Raspberry Pi- and cloud-powered devices, including a 3D printer, a coffee station, a CNC router, and a Pac Man-style game. Stephen Chin, director of Oracle Technology Network, looked on with pride. A selection of the 15 partners for Oracle Code displayed their wares nearby, and it was clear they weren’t there just to pitch their products. They were there to learn themselves what’s coming next, as Bitnami’s Bennett explained.
“The focus right now is on containers, but containers are only part of the problem we are trying to solve,” Bennett said. “The problem is: How do we get functionality into production reliably and repeatably? There’s been less emphasis on the CI and CD parts of that machine than there were on the orchestration and delivery pieces. So it’s refreshing to hear the talk from one of the Oracle teams on their experiences implementing CI and CD for a service that runs on top of Bare Metal Cloud Service. I think that’s a common set of challenges: How do I apply this end-to-end? It’s not really about the tooling, it’s about the organization.” 
 By the end of Oracle Code’s world tour, he—and thousands of developers—should be closer to the answer.

Thomas Kurian Outlines What'sNext in Oracle Cloud

					By John Foley









 







At Oracle OpenWorld 2016, Thomas Kurian will outline the latest developments in Oracle Cloud.


Oracle is developing new capabilities in infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS), as it continues to build and expand its integrated stack of cloud services.
As it does, Oracle is making it easier for developers everywhere to access and take advantage of the full range of tools and technologies available in Oracle Cloud, including Oracle software as well as non-Oracle and open source software.
In advance of the Oracle OpenWorld 2016 and JavaOne conferences in San Francisco, September 18 to 22, we asked Thomas Kurian, president of product development at Oracle, to discuss the many new capabilities and innovations that will be of interest to Oracle customers, developers, and partners.

As Oracle ramps up its infrastructure-as-a-service offerings, what are the offerings for compute? 

Thomas Kurian: Oracle's IaaS strategy is to allow customers, using software APIs and a graphical user interface, to define software-defined virtual data centers that run in Oracle Cloud. These software-defined data centers obviously include virtual networks to which customers can attach different kinds of compute and different kinds of storage. And we do four things: We give you very fast and very predictable performance and scalability; great reliability and availability; differentiated security; and a high degree of control and governance.
Compute is the building block, and we've got five flavors of compute services for different kinds of workloads. If you want the absolute top-notch performance and you want to install your own operating system, we offer a bare-metal service where you can come to an API and programmatically create a virtual network and attach to it high-performance and very dense servers.





Oracle President Thomas Kurian explains the range of compute options available with Oracle’s infrastructure-as-a-service offerings.

If you want elastic compute, you can go to an API and create a hypervisor-based elastic compute environment that runs Linux, Windows, Oracle Solaris, Ubuntu, or CentOS. If you want a SPARC environment, you can do the same with SPARC Solaris, where you can create a SPARC environment, create LDOMs and zones, in Oracle Cloud.
If you're concerned about isolation from a security or performance point of view—you want predictable performance and you don't want any contention with your resources from other customers—we offer elastic compute in a model called dedicated compute, which is an isolated rack of 500, 1,000, or 2,000 cores where you can get an isolated rack of servers but elastically configured through the same API.
And last but not least, if you've got VMware or KVM workloads and you want to migrate them, we have a solution called Ravello that allows you to migrate your existing VMware and KVM workloads to the cloud without changes to the virtual machines themselves or their network interrelationships. So we have a range of choices for optimal performance and easy workload migration from on-premises to the cloud. 

What about storage and networking offerings? 

Kurian: There are two aspects to networking. First, what does the access mechanism from your premises to our cloud look like? We offer three flavors. 
You can configure virtual private compute, which means that your compute and storage services in Oracle Cloud are an extension of your company's IP network address space. You would see our cloud services essentially as an extension of your company's corporate network and its IP address space into the cloud. The benefit of that is, if you want to move a workload that is on-premises to the cloud, the migration process is seamless.




 If you want to move a workload that is on-premises to the cloud, the migration process is seamless.  
—Thomas Kurian, Oracle President of Product Development



Second, if you just need a virtual private network, you can use your Cisco, Juniper, Open/R, or a variety of standard VPN clients and connect over a secure VPN into Oracle Cloud.
If you need 10 Gb/sec or more in bandwidth to stream a lot of data into and out of our cloud, and you do not want that traffic to go to the public internet, we offer something called Fast Connect. This is the ability to have a 10-Gb/sec link into our cloud either over an MPLS circuit from your telecom provider or from our partner, Equinix, with something called Cloud Exchange.
Within the cloud, you can define virtual networks of various kinds. We've got a very efficient network architecture to allow you to have a core network that does not get oversubscribed and avoids contention between people, and also then to partition that securely where two different tenants are segregated logically so they do not have cross-talk between them.
We have five kinds of storage. If you're running an application that needs superlow latency, we've got nodes with very dense non-volatile memory/SSD or flash so you get superfast response time. In addition, we have nodes that have all-flash SSDs in addition to NVME for up to 6.4 terabytes per node. So you can run a big application, lots of data, in-memory, with very low latency from local disk, which can be either NVME or flash.
If you want to put in more than that volume of data, we've got high-performance block storage with spinning disks as well as with SSD or flash-resource pools. If you want to share data between your data center and our cloud or between two different data centers within our cloud, we have object storage. You access it through an S3-compatible API, Openstack SWIFT, or through our RESTful API. You can back up files, database objects, put it into the object store, then replicate it to different services in our cloud.
And finally, archival is useful if you want to store objects in the cloud because you want to save money and you don't need superlow latency recovery times for that data. You get extremely cheap storage. It's $12,000 a petabyte—a petabyte—a year. It's meant to provide you the best cost performance for archive in the industry.
These new services are being offered from Oracle's cloud data centers. Where is Oracle building data centers? 

Kurian: Oracle has 22 data centers around the world. In North America, we have a western-region location near Phoenix, a central region in Chicago, and an eastern region near Ashburn, Virginia. We have a data center in Toronto and a disaster recovery in Calgary. In Latin America, we're in São Paulo, Brazil. 
In Europe, we have two locations in the UK, expanding to three, and two locations on the continent, expanding to three. We have a location in the Middle East under development, five locations in Asia, two in Australia, and two in Japan.
We're opening a data center in China with a partner. We have a location in Singapore, and we're evaluating data centers in Korea, Turkey, and India. So we have broad coverage around the world.
What are these data centers like?

Kurian: In each region such as the US western region in Phoenix, we typically have three locations on three separate power grids, so if one power grid goes down, the other two locations keep running. We call that availability domains. Each availability domain is connected to the others over dark fiber so you get less than 10 milliseconds latency, and each region is connected with other regions over a fiber ring. So you have different degrees of redundancy and high availability that you can design within a region or across regions. 
What is Oracle doing to enable open source and non-Oracle software stacks to run in IaaS? 

Kurian: Our cloud does two important things. It runs any piece of software, whether that is Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, open source, or a packaged application. As long as the software runs on Linux, Windows, Oracle Solaris, Ubuntu, or CentOS, it can run in our cloud. 
On open source, we're doing a lot of things with the community to get three kinds of things done with our cloud. One is to certify the most popular open source packages with our cloud. This could be Cassandra, Hadoop, Node.js, Tomcat, MySQL, a variety of NoSQL databases, Kafka, Mesos, Docker, and many others. So you can pick and choose your open source technology. There are about 480 open source packages we have certified on our cloud.
Second is we're working with a number of partners—for example, HashiCorp—who have test-and-development tools that people like to use as part of their continuous integration DevTest or DevOps cycle. So you could check in your source on GitHub, kick off a dependency-management view using Maven, run a continuous build using Jenkins. Once your build is complete, you can pack up your image using something like Packer, deploy that to our cloud, and instantiate the service. And throughout that cycle, we're working on automating the developer lifecycle across this environment.
The third thing we have done is a number of optimizations on some of these key technologies for performance, reliability, and ease of use. For example, we've introduced a service to allow people to use Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka analytics completely elastically, with great performance and via an API. So you can push data into our object store and spin up a Hadoop cluster. You can also pump in data into our cloud using, for example, a Kafka stream so that you can do real-time streaming of data. On top of that Hadoop cluster, you can spin up Spark SQL, Spark streaming, and Spark Machine Learning (Spark ML) applications.
So in broad brush, with open source we're doing three things: certifying the best open source products. And it's an ever-expanding universe so people have a fantastic experience with them. Second, we're optimizing a bunch of them for our cloud and building services based on open source. And in many cases, we contribute back to those communities so that they get a rich set of functionality. And third is we're working with the leading tools vendors in open source to optimize the DevOps cycle and workflow.

What differentiates Oracle's cloud infrastructure offerings from those of other cloud providers? 



Get started with Oracle IaaS solutions



Kurian: Five things: First is unbelievably fast performance. Customers have benchmarked us against other cloud vendors and found we're three to nine times faster, due to a combination of hardware and software architecture, and an ultramodern core network design. Second is scale and reliability. In our cloud, you can run mission-critical application and database workloads with great reliability. For instance, we can run databases as large as 240 terabytes in our cloud.
Third is the issue of control. We have capability in our cloud around something called subaccounts and compartments. It's about one simple thing: We want the IT department in a company to be able to procure cloud services from Oracle, give them visibility so they can procure centrally, delegate budget and quota to different departments and projects, then track utilization without being worried that people are buying things outside of their control.
Fourth is deep security. There are a number of things we've done from a security point of view which are truly unique. Assume you have two customers, each connecting to our cloud services from their own virtual private network. We have a flat, highly scalable core network, but every customer's traffic is isolated inside their own logical virtual network.  So there's deep security capability built in through the entire stack, whether it's around data security, certificate management, how we handle encryption, or segregation of duties. 
Last is ease of migration. Many customers say: 'We'd like to go to a cloud, but we have many existing workloads we need to migrate. How do we do that?' A common example is VMware or KVM workloads. We have a technology that allows you to look at your entire VMware estate, pick a collection of virtual machines that are interconnected, lift the entire collection of Virtual Machines as what we call an application capsule—all those virtual machines, their network relationships, their IP addresses—and lift all of them to the cloud as one unit without any change to the application, the VMs, or the virtual network.  It saves you cost and time.
What is Oracle's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) strategy? And what new things has Oracle introduced? 
Kurian: Our PaaS strategy is about solving three things. One, giving customers a complete platform based on Oracle and open source technology that's standards-based for building cloud services and applications.
Two, it dramatically lowers the cost of ownership for people using the software, because we've taken all of the cost and labor associated with installing, configuring, patching, backing up, encrypting, and maintaining the Oracle software and eliminated it by automating all of this through software. So you simply use the software; you don't have to operate the software.





Oracle Cloud's PaaS offerings reduce cost and complexity by automating many tasks associated with on-premises systems.


And third, it's built on top of our infrastructure as a service (IaaS), so you inherit the benefits of the IaaS  from a performance, scaling, reliability, and security point of view.
There are eight categories to Oracle's Platform as a Service: data management, application development, business intelligence, big data, mobility, content collaboration, integration tools, and identity. And at Oracle OpenWorld 2016, we're introducing the ninth, which is a comprehensive suite of monitoring and management services for applications and systems.
So it's a broad collection of services, and at the heart, it's about this very simple proposition: Imagine that you wanted to use our database, but you didn't have a DBA or a storage admin or a network admin or a sys admin. In the past you would not be able to use it, but now you can because we've automated everything associated. And you simply can use it through an API or through a console that's as simple as an ecommerce system.

Oracle is introducing Oracle Database 12c for the cloud. What is so significant about this Oracle Database release? 



Oracle Database 12c on Oracle Cloud adds new features and capabilities, including industry-leading multitenant architecture and new affordable database options.



Kurian: Oracle Database 12c has three important new capabilities or features. First, it's unbelievably fast and scalable to build really scalable cloud applications. In version 12.1, we introduced a capability for in-memory databases, and there are a lot of enhancements in 12.2 that we're announcing at Oracle OpenWorld that significantly improve the feature-richness of in-memory databases. And you can get access to it right away in the cloud.
Second, we've introduced a technology called multitenant database. This is the ability to isolate individual tenants' data from each other without having to operate many different databases—one for each customer. So one physical database instance can have many logical partitions, called tenants, and it gives you a much denser and hence lower cost system to administer because you can have many more databases inside one physical database instance.
The important announcement we're making at Oracle OpenWorld 2016 is an extraordinarily attractively priced version of this database. It's as cheap as $175 a month. And you don't have to administer or manage the database; you simply use it. And you get an isolated, secure multitenant partition.
Number three, there's a lot of new capability in Version 12c around improvements in data management and scalability. We have introduced sharding as a native feature of Oracle Database to allow developers to use shards as a solution to build large scale, scale-out architectures.
So it's a big new release, and it's designed to help solve some of the problems customers had historically running these scaled databases in the cloud. It gives you fast performance. It can scale really well both for data warehouses and transaction processing. And in addition to what we've done for the big, high-end customer workloads, if you're a small customer who wants to start with a simple app, does not have a DBA but wants to use the power of Oracle, you can now do it for as little as $175 a month.

What is Oracle introducing for Hadoop, big data, and business analytics? 

Kurian: For big data, at Oracle OpenWorld 2016 we're announcing an ultramodern analytics platform that's elastically configurable in Oracle Cloud. Imagine you want to do analytics on data coming from your ecommerce system: What are people buying online? What are they browsing? You want to merge their clickstream, and you want to look at real-time data coming off your internet feed. 



Oracle's Thomas Kurian announces a new Oracle adaptive intelligence application suite that's "a major step forward for Oracle and how we look at data processing in the cloud."


You can say, I'd like to load batch data into the cloud through our object store. Then you can come to a console or an API and quickly and easily spin up a Hadoop cluster. That will load the data from the object store, and you can run a variety of workloads on top of it—Map Reduce, Spark SQL, ML, or Streaming workloads.
And you don't have to administer the Hadoop cluster. It's done for you automatically. The real-time feeds you can stream into our cloud over a streaming service, based on technology called Kafka, which is highly scalable. And you can blend data between the Hadoop system and Kafka using Spark.
You can also do machine learning and other things. On top of that, if you are a data scientist, you can use this entire technology stack and pay for it by the hour or the month. If you want to spin up the workload, run the processing, and shut it down, you can.
If you are a business analyst but want to use this infrastructure, we're introducing a complete next-generation analytic tool set which has three parts, beginning with a data-flow environment, where you can model a data-flow pipeline. The data-flow pipeline can also call into a data-quality tool built on top of this infrastructure that lets you do things like cleansing, data preparation, and graph analysis, so you can keep your data set clean. And last, data discovery, which is an environment where end users can collaborate to analyze the data set. It's a major step forward.
On top of this infrastructure, we're introducing services like our Internet of Things, or IoT, cloud service. We're talking about a new generation of smart manufacturing applications. We're adding capability around Oracle Data Cloud, where you can blend applications and data together, and there's a new data-driven or adaptive intelligence application suite. So it's a major step forward for Oracle and how we look at data processing in the cloud.
What about application development with containers? 

Kurian: Containers are a technology we've got extraordinary interest in. Docker offers three important benefits. First, it gives you a vendor-neutral, portable way to build and deploy applications. So you can design your application, package it, and put it in a Docker registry, then spin up your workload as a microservice within a Docker environment—all in a vendor-neutral way. It allows you to fundamentally not be tied to a particular cloud vendor from the point of view of how you create and spin up containers. 
We're offering four capabilities. We're introducing a container service in our cloud: the ability to go to a console or an API and spin up a Docker container elastically and define policies if you want to scale up or down.
Second, you can have a Docker registry that allows you to stage images and other things in this Docker environment, which is fully managed. It runs on top of something called Mesos Marathon, which provides the infrastructure to scale out the workload.
The third thing we're doing is creating a set of prepackaged services that anybody who's building a microservice on this container can use without having to stand up their own infrastructure. For example, there are a number of things people want when they're building microservices. They want an elastic search solution so they can put their logs and get them indexed. We're introducing a telemetry service to do that. They want something called consensus to get coherence across a cluster. We're introducing, based on etcD technology, a consensus solution.
They want to have a streaming infrastructure to stream data in. You have the ability to stream data in over Kafka. So there's a lot of different pieces where our goal is to allow a person who wants to build a microservice-based application to not have to worry about infrastructure. Simply say, 'I need X amount of resource to spin up,' and we'll spin up a container for them. They put their images in the Docker registry, and we promote it up into the container that they've spun up.
And then instead of having to stand up all these ancillary services themselves, we give them multitenant versions of these services that they just simply call through an API and use as part of their application.
How can customers of Oracle's or another company's SaaS applications use Oracle's PaaS? 

Kurian: If you're a customer of our SaaS or another company's SaaS applications, there are three ways you can use Oracle's platform as a service. For example, you may want to build an extension to our SaaS application or another company's SaaS application. We have a product called Application Builder Cloud Service. It's meant for a person who's a declarative developer, not a hardcore programmer. It's built on an open-source JavaScript framework. You drag and drop, visually assemble this application, and you can extend it using JavaScript and not a proprietary programming language. So imagine you had a marketing cloud in somebody else's sales cloud, and you wanted to blend in a UI for a salesperson the information from our marketing cloud with sales cloud. You could do that by building an extension to this application using Application Builder Cloud Service. 
Second is Oracle Integration Cloud Service. Assume you have our cloud SaaS for customer relationship management, and you want to connect it to Oracle E-Business Suite as an enterprise resource planning system that sits on your premises. You can use Oracle Integration Cloud Service to do API Management, provide secure messaging using its service bus, and define orchestration or business processes on top of it using our BPEL solution. 
Third, imagine you're running HR in our cloud. You're an HR professional, and you want to blend some data from HR with information from payroll. And say payroll is with ADP or Paychex or some other payroll system. You don't have a DBA or a professional analyst, but you want to do some analysis. So we've introduced Oracle Visual Analyzer or data visualization. It allows you to extract data from our SaaS app or from an on-premises system. All you need to know is Microsoft Excel to do an extract. You upload the data using a spreadsheet, and then blend it. All you need is a browser. 
In order to do analysis and build reports, you do not need to have a DBA or a database, or need to know SQL. You can do all that analysis self-service if you're a line-of-business professional. So three ways you can use our cloud if you're a SaaS customer: to extend it, integrate it, do analysis.
Oracle is working with the developer community in new ways and offering developers new tools and cloud services. What are some of these? 

Kurian: First and foremost, we're working with the developer community to make our technology accessible to everybody who wants to use it. If you're a developer, in the past, if you wanted to use Oracle, you had to have a server. You needed a DBA to stand it up. You needed to have a fairly powerful system. You had to pay for a license fee. 
Now with our cloud, you can access any software we have with a browser or an API core, and we've published our APIs into a catalog. We make all these services available. You can trial these services for a month or two without paying a single dollar for them. So we've broadened the reach of our software to everybody so they can access it and build applications with it. 





Thomas Kurian outlines new resources, tools, and events aimed at making it easier for application developers to take advantage of the wide range of technologies available in Oracle Cloud.


And we know developers love open source tools and technologies. We talked already about everything we're doing to bring these technologies and integrate them with services in our cloud so you can use the best tools to automate how you build, deploy, manage software environments. 
Third, we're doing some specific things for the new class of developer called the infrastructure developer, the person traditionally called DevOps. If you look at infrastructure as a service, what it's really done is take hardware and made it programmable through an API, and there's a new class of developer who's responsible for spinning up infrastructure. So there are a lot of new things we're doing for them.
Last, we're launching a major new developer program. We're introducing a new portal, called Developer.Oracle.com, with a lot more refreshed content, very topical, covering things that really matter to the developer. We're introducing a new developer road show and training for developers in new ways. We're introducing a program to university students, where they can learn about technologies by running those solutions in our cloud and simply using their student ID to get access to these technologies. We're introducing a lot of online training, including these massively online courses for developers who want to hear from our product engineers about how a particular piece of software was designed and why it was designed that way.
So lots of new things. Making our software accessible to them, integrating with open-source tools, and getting them information and access to this technology.
We hear a lot about DevOps. What is DevOps and what is Oracle doing with its cloud offerings to make the DevOps function viable in companies? 

Kurian: What is DevOps? When you move to IaaS or SaaS or PaaS, what we've really done is taken infrastructure—servers, storage, network—and made it programmatically accessible through an API. There's a developer who is responsible for creating that environment, for standing up compute, defining virtual networks, attaching compute and storage to it, and managing the whole process. That person has traditionally been called an infrastructure developer, or DevOps, because he's development but also responsible for operating that environment. 
We're making our infrastructure and platform services accessible to a well-defined, well-documented, standards-based REST API so infrastructure developers can get access to these functions—create virtual networks, attach compute and storage, spin up databases or app servers—all at the end of an API.
The second thing we've done is integrate these APIs with popular third-party tools that people want, in order to make this entire devops pipeline highly efficient, highly parallel, and highly productive. 
You mentioned Oracle is helping to train college students and other developers on the newest technologies. What are the next steps in this program? 

Kurian: We've launched a student program, both for universities and for independent students who are pursuing continuous education. So if you're a student, and let's say you want to learn about Java or want to learn about how to use SQL within Oracle Database. We're launching a program to allow a student to go to Oracle Cloud, register with a credit card, a student ID, then use the software at an extraordinarily economical price. 
Second, if you're a university professor in computer science and teaching a class, and you want a lab environment where you can train students on a particular piece of technology—and historically you had to buy a computer and install it on your floor—we now offer a program that lots of universities are working with us on to take these solutions and give access to an entire class set where the students can collaborate on computer science programs and projects using our cloud.
Third, we've done something to also take this technology to high school children and elementary school kids, where we're working with a variety of nonprofit organizations to help students who want to learn about new technologies, whether that's HTML, JavaScript, Java, and so on, to learn to program without having to buy a lot of expensive equipment and doing it on premises.
What's next in terms of simpler, faster access to Oracle Cloud services? 

Kurian: Simpler, faster access. You know, the biggest new thing we'll be introducing this fall is a much simpler experience for a customer who wants to buy Oracle Cloud services. There are two things we're going to do. One, we're introducing a mobile app where you can go to an Apple or Google Play store, download the app, create an account, browse a catalog of services, and procure the catalog or the service. You can go through four screens, and you can get a cloud service up and running. 
Second, we're introducing a new ecommerce store dedicated to our cloud services—again, a super-simple experience. You create an account, register your credit card, browse the catalog of services and pick one, tell us the configuration you want, and buy.
Earlier this year, Oracle introduced Oracle Cloud at Customer, a way of bringing Oracle's PaaS and IaaS services inside the firewall. How does this work? And what other cloud services can be offered this way? 

Kurian: There are many customers who would love to use the cloud but don't for three reasons. First, the government of their country precludes data from any company or organization in that country from going outside the country's boundaries. And it may be that we don't have a data center in that country. 
Even if the country allows it, in certain regulated industries—whether the federal public sector, telecommunications, financial services—there are additional regulatory hurdles that preclude companies from putting data into a public cloud. 
Third, a corporation's own executives may be risk-averse. They may be fine with a class of applications running in the cloud, but for certain kinds of applications they may be too sensitive yet to put data into a public cloud.
So Oracle Cloud at Customer is a very simple notion. You love our infrastructure as a service. You want elastic infrastructure as a service or platform as a service. Exact same software, same API, same price, managed for you on your premises, contracted as a metered or subscription service, not as a bunch of hardware that you buy. There's enormous interest from customers.
The next thing we're introducing with the Oracle Cloud at Customer program is our SaaS offering. On top of infrastructure and platform as a service, you can also run Oracle Fusion application software as a service with the Oracle Cloud at Customer program.

NetApp CEO Geroge
  Kurian
NetApp




  The myth about identical twins is that they can simply switch
  places when they want to, so that being a twin is like having a
  best friend and a clone wrapped into one.


  For George Kurian, the CEO of NetApp and Thomas Kurian,
  Oracle's president of product development that myth is
  practically true.


They are literal doppelgangers who rose to the top
  with so much togetherness, at one point they literally got
  up and switched jobs, sending each of them on their current path
  to success.

George Kurian was appointed CEO of $5.5 billion
  storage company NetApp about a year ago after a fast, meteoric
  rise at the company. 


  Thomas Kurian has spent nearly 20 years at Oracle. He reports to
  Oracle's executive chairman and CTO Larry Ellison, and has even
  been rumored to be 
  in line to become CEO when Ellison fully
  retires. Sources close to Thomas tell us he
  has Ellison's ear because he's hardworking and smart and
  will challenge the geek-at-heart billionaire on
  technical product issues and tends to be right. Ellison
  loves a winner.


Business Insider recently met with George Kurian to talk
  about his career, his twin, and how he plans to
  revitalize NetApp, a $5.5 billion company with 11,000
  employees, at a time when the business is facing major
  challenges.

  boys

  George and twin brother Thomas are the youngest of four brothers.
  (George is technically older by a few seconds, he laughs.) 

The Kurians were born to a self-made business man in
  the scenic, laid-back beach and agricultural state of Kerala,
  India. Their dad was the son of a farmer who educated
  himself and became a successful in the manufacturing industry.
  His mom was born to Indian parents living in Sri Lanka. She
  immigrated to India to go to college which was "unheard of" for a
  woman in that day, George tells us.


  "We were all held in line by my mom. She was loving but tough. We
  were all raised with those Christian values and she did things
  very different than most Indian parents," he says.


  For instance, with all boys and no girls, she didn't follow the
  typical gender role stereotypes.


  "All the boys took turns in kitchen, did house chores, had to be
  responsible for clearing dinner, doing everything required in the
  house," he says.


  She was famously strict in the neighborhood. She would call the
  boys from their Cricket-in-the-street game at 6 p.m. and by
  6:01 they had to have their hands washed and be at the table or
  they wouldn't get dinner, he says.


  It worked. In addition to raising two multi-millionaire tech
  execs, her oldest son is a private equity investor in
  Bangalore and the second oldest is a pediatrician in the U.K.,
  George says. 


  Twin careers


  The twins moved to the US together to go to college at
  Princeton, earning scholarships to study engineering.

  Chef Day where an executive and a summer intern serve lunch to
  employees to raise money for the local food
  bank.

  "It was a good thing that we came together. It gave us a friend
  to navigate the big cultural transition between India and US," he
  says.


  While in college, George worked any odd job he could to
  raise spending money: "parking cars, working in the
  cafeteria, being a pizza chef, bartending, you name it," he
  says. "It taught me that it takes all kinds of people to make a
  business work."

George got a job at Oracle straight from
  college and Thomas landed as a consultant at McKenzie.


  A few years later, each of them wanted to try the other's
  job. So in 1996, they
  switched. George went to McKenzie and
  became a consultant and Thomas went to Oracle to be an engineer.


"It isn’t that we intended to that. It’s just that we both
  had good experiences and were interested in trying it out,"
  George explains matter-of-factly.


  "I worked at Oracle before he did, and introduced him. He's had a
  spectacular run there, going on 20 years," he notes.

George  moved to Boston to work for internet
  network company Akamai and met his wife. In typical style,
  Thomas married a woman from Boston, too.


  They even went to grad school, earning their MBAs at Stanford
  together. Now both brothers live in the Bay Area.

  But the twins don't share an extravagant lifestyle that most
  other multi-millionaire Valley execs do. No private plane for
  instance. 


  "If we got a private plane, our mom would smack us down," he
  laughs. "You cannot grow up in India without realizing that so
  many people have so much less than you have."


  One more thing his mother doesn't let him do? He can't act
  superior to his twin because he's a CEO.


  "When I told her that I was named the CEO, she said, 'Great, but
  we don’t carry business cards at home,'" he says, laughing at the
  story. "She constantly asks me if we’re being good husbands and
  fathers. That brings you down to earth."


  Fast rise at NetApp


  While Thomas climbed Oracle's
  ladder, George spent nine years at Cisco,
  NetApp's partner. That's how he got hired away to lead
  NetApp's flagship storage management product OnTap.


  NetApp was in a dire situation with OnTap. It had to be
  modernized into a "clustering" storage management product,
  something the company had been working on for years, not very
  successfully. In the meantime, competitors were eating its lunch,
  overall revenues were sinking. The company had more than
  one big layoff and morale was low.

George had no experience building storage
  products. His background was in networking and servers. And
  he took a lot of grief from his team for that.


  "I was reminded every day," he says.  


  He listened to everyone's ideas and he also challenged
  people. Some people didn't like it and left the
  company.


  He told the ones who stayed: 'We’ve got to make this successful
  otherwise the company ceases to be relevant in storage," and with
  the future of the company at stake, "everybody set aside their
  personal agenda and worked on it," he says.


  The product shipped and customers are buying it. Today it
  accounts for "80% of new shipments. It was essentially zero when
  I joined NetApp," George says.


  Some customers have become downright fan boys. The clustering
  technology means they don't have to schedule IT downtime on
  nights and weekends to do their work.


  Ordering more layoffs


  Now George Kurian needs to carry the success he brought
  to the OnTap group to the rest of the company. 


When NetApp's board asked 10-year CEO Tom
  Georgens to step down in June 2015, they
  made 
George 
interim CEO
  hiring him permanently a short time later.

George Kurian joined NetApp in 2011 and was CEO
  four years later. He had never been a CEO before.


  He knows he's got his work cut out for him. NetApp is still
  shrinking. At the start of this year, he announced another
  huge layoff, 12% of the company or 1,500 people. 


  He called it an "incredibly difficult decision" and says he wants
  to fix the company so he never has to do it again. 


  In December he bought Boulder, Colorado-based all-flash
  storage maker SolidFire for $870 million in cash.


  NetApp desperately needed to get into the all-flash storage
  market, the new direction for corporate storage. It's late to
  this area but George has a come-back for that criticism.


  "Being first to market is not necessarily the successful outcome.
  Violin and Fusion-io were first, look where they are," he tells
  us.


  Fusion-io hit a tailspin a few years ago and was bought by
  Sandisk in 2014. Violin Memory's stock is currently trading for
  less than $1.

  Still, NetApp isn't out of the woods. It reported
  a disappointing fourth quarter in May, with a miss on profit
  and revenue and dimmer-than-expected guidance. And there's
  endless speculation that its low stock price will make it an
  acquisition target. It's down about 21% from a year ago to
  about $26. (Likely buyer Cisco says it doesn't want it.).


  Kurian admits, "We've got a lot of work to do," but
  he says he's also made progress in his first year putting in
  new leadership, revamping business processes, updating the
  products and buying SolidFire.


  He says its his job now to "just execute."


  Thinking of his mother and brother, he also knows says he
  must "be humble about knowing you are not expert in all
  disciplines."

Analysis: A Look at Oracle-Sun's Impact on 'Horizontal' Integration 
Oracle Corp. officially closed its $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems on Wednesday. IDN offers a look at how the “vertical integration” of Oracle-Sun will impact horizontal integration, as well as a review of Oracle’s horizontal integration plans for Java, app servers, SOA and cloud.

Oracle Corp. officially closed its $7.4 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems on Wednesday at a live physical/online event featuring Oracle top executives laying out a vision for transforming Oracle into a 21st century version of “IBM of the 1960s.”
 
For the most part, the Oracle/Sun event, focused on how Oracle will “vertically integrate” Sun hardware and Solaris with Oracle software (middleware, databases and applications). Oracle CEO Larry Ellison cited his company’s Oracle-Sun vertical integration strategy as a boon to the new company, and to customers. “The notion of vertical integration we think delivers huge value to customers," Ellison said in the webcast. "Our vision for 2010 is the same as IBM's vision for 1960," he said.
 
But, there were also comments and plans revealed for “horizontal integration” that are noteworthy for CIOs, architects and integration developers. Integration Developer News offers a round-up of Oracle’s horizontal integration technology plans for key technologies, including Java, Middleware, MySQL and Cloud.
 
Later, IDN also gets views from top middleware experts on what customers and partners with interests in integration, middleware and SOA should keep their eyes on. First, here’s our IDN “integration” summary. 
 
Oracle’s State of the Union on Middleware, Integration
JavaCalling Java one of the “crown jewels,’ from the Sun acquisition, Thomas Kurian, executive vice president of Oracle product development, said Oracle will “enhance and extend the reach of the Java programming [language] to support  emerging application paradigms,”  Among those paradigms are apps for mobile, Web 2.0 and even vertical applications.
 
Kurian also said Oracle will “Integrate and simplify the [Java EE] runtime and for existing and emerging deployment architectures [and] invest in and revitalize Java developer community.”    Specifics include a soon-to-come Java EE 7 that will better enable Java  devs to write once and run anywhere across a variety of server and devices,  abstract emerging underlying support capabilities, (especially for mobile devices) to let devs more simply and quickly write applications that support of new features, and a future upgrade to java FX to expand support for RIA (Rich internet Applications). Oracle will also invest in taking JavaOne, Sun’s hallmark developer event for Java, global – with versions for China and India. 
IDEsNotably, Oracle will keep and invest in NetBeans, Sun’s open source Java IDE. The goal, Kurian said is to support devs using lightweight Java , dynamic languages and scripting.  Oracle will also provide reference implementations in NetBeans for Java EE developers. Even with the NetBeans endorsement, Oracle will keep JDeveloper as its “strategic” ALM tool for enterprise devs.  Oracle will also continue to support Eclipse.
 
Middleware / SOA On the middleware side, Oracle Fusion Middleware will continue to be the core offering, with the focus to provide customers an integrated middleware suite “to build and integrate with SOA, business processes and BI [business intelligence].”
 
The Oracle SOA Suite will remain Oracle’s strategic offering for SOA and integrated SOA/BPM (business process management). That said, Oracle will “support and enhance” Sun’s JCAPS (Java CAPS) and the Open ESB for existing customers.  Sun’s GlassFish Mobility will continue forward, Kurian said. 




Some of Sun’s middleware technology will get a lease on life after the merger. Specifically, Oracle will supplement OFM with several Sun middleware technologies to improve business agility, performance and management, Kurian added.    WebLogic will continue to be Oracle’s core appserver offering for enterprise customers.  That said, Kurian said there will be technology sharing back-and-forth between WebLogic and Sun’s GlassFish application server.  Specifically, GlassFish application server will be carried forward to provide a reference implementation for Java EE 6.  In the future, Oracle will “build on [GlassFish’s] microkernel architecture for modularity” to bring improve that capability for Java EE devs.  Further, Oracle likes three other GlassFish technologies:

A sophisticated “non-blocking I/O layer,” as Kurian called it, because it can result in better performance for many I/O-intensive applications. 
The “Metro” web services technology layer tech layer, Metro, which does better at unifying underlying support of JAX-based web services technologies. 
A lightweight rapid deployment environment. 

MySQLTo the surprise of some, Oracle is very happy to keep going with MySQL, especially for customers who use both MySQL and Oracle DBs for online search, web support and transaction applications, according to Oracle’s chief corporate architect Edward Screven.
“We’re going to make MySQL better, we’ve already done with InnoDB the most popular transactional storage engine” for MySQL, Screven said, who will oversee Oracle’s Open Source Software Division. Oracle will also “make MySQL part of the Oracle stack,” he added, building integration between MySQL and Oracle Enterprise Manager and Oracle Enterprise Security Manager. CloudLast but not least, Oracle executives, even Ellison, are now warming to cloud computing – both in technology and terminology. Despite his widely viewed cloud tirade on YouTube (what the hell is cloud computing?”) Ellison now says cloud is what Oracle has been doing all along – so no need to go look at nouveau cloud providers like Amazon, Google, Azure and the like.
As to how Sun’s portfolio impacts the Oracle view of the cloud, the outlook is mixed for the future of Sun technologies in the cloud space.  On the sunny side, Sun’s effort to move its OpenOffice productivity suite will gain traction after the acquisition. On the stormier side, Sun’s public cloud infrastructure offering that was slated to be released last summer as ‘Sun Cloud’ will not be seeing the light of day.  "We're not going to be offering the Sun Cloud service," Screven confirmed. Vertical' vs 'Horizontal' IntegrationPerspectives from HP and a .NET PartnerTo get some perspective on the outlook for how ‘vertical integration’ might impact “horizontal integration,” IDN also spoke with leading executives from HP and a top Java-.NET interoperability firm JNBridge. Not surprisingly, many vendors and customers are waiting for more details to discover how much visibility and openness there will be to layers of the new Oracle-Sun stack.  But some early reactions from knowledgeable integration players reveal some items to watch: HP:  Kelly Emo, Senior Product Marketing Manager, Applications at HP Software and Solutions told IDN: “The acquisition does give food for thought. I think Oracle is clearly is looking for the “solution in a box” that converges and collapses the stack from physical hardware all the way to the application layer and can support both private and public cloud implementations,” “From an HP perspective, we believe regardless of the middleware stack that customers chose, their biggest challenges are going to be around the people, processes and technologies that will allow them to meet or exceed their business objectives of agility, performance, security, availability and change.”  Tapping into cloud computing will be an important part of this activity, she told IDN. In this context, enterprise managers will be looking to Oracle for more answers on these topics:

How will Oracle "rationalize all the overlaps and redundant products up the stack" --  from app platforms to ESB to EAI to BPM to Data integration
How will Oracle promot a "pre-fabricated [Oracle-Sun] stack,; while supporting IT innovation, especially at the component level for SCA, mash-ups, integration, BPM and business intelligence
How will Oracle continue to be the stewards of Java and keep the spirit of an open industry

 
Notably, HP also believes in vertical integration and cloud technologies. Earlier in January, HP inked a 3-year co-development pact with Microsoft to accomplish three (3) goals:

built on a next-generation infrastructure-to-application model; 
advance cloud computing by speeding application implementation; and 
eliminate complexities of IT management and automate existing manual processes to lower the overall costs. 

JNBridge: Wayne Citrin, CTO of JNBridge, a leading provider of interop technologies between Java and Microsoft .NET told IDN: “Everything in the [Oracle] stack will be Java based, so for those [enterprises] largely Java, it shouldn’t be any more difficult to integrate. But, for people playing in multiple environments, Java, .NET [and others] interoperability between the pieces might get more difficult,” Citrin told IDN.  “It could get easier or more difficult, he noted, adding “Oracle could decide to make things more visible, after all their Java stack has an API service and the  .NET stack has an API service, so the bigger those stacks are, the more [interoperability] opportunities there are.”

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
