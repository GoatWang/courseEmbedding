Burton Family
"The uncertainty of a new state, new job and new home are never easy to come to terms with. Although this change is certain as long as you are active members of the military, you can never prepare for the uncertainty that comes along the way. When there are groups and companies out there like the VAMC, it renews the hope that everything will be alright."









Gotts Family
"Working with VAMortgageCenter was fantastic. We got to closing on time. We had a very short deadline to get there and they made it happen for us. Our broker was really knowledgeable with everything going on in the market. He knew when to lock in the interest rate and how to get us to closing fast."

"The uncertainty of a new state, new job and new home are never easy to come to terms with. Although this change is certain as long as you are active members of the military, you can never prepare for the uncertainty that comes along the way. When there are groups and companies out there like the VAMC, it renews the hope that everything will be alright."









Gotts Family
"Working with VAMortgageCenter was fantastic. We got to closing on time. We had a very short deadline to get there and they made it happen for us. Our broker was really knowledgeable with everything going on in the market. He knew when to lock in the interest rate and how to get us to closing fast."

FHA Loan
The difference between an FHA and a Conventional Loan
While many people deciding on a loan product in RI, MA, CT, NH, VT, and ME  rely  exclusively on their lenders recommendation, you should understand the basic  difference between an FHA loan and a Conventional Loan. The term Conventional  Loan includes all loans under the current FNMA and FHLMC lending limits. Some  of these may be called Conforming, A paper, subprime and other industry names.
Most people that have heard of FHA loans tend to associate  them with purchase money transactions. While purchases are the most common use,  FHA loans are also available for rate and term refinance loans as well as Cash  Out refinances.
The main advantage of a FHA vs conventional loan is that the  credit qualifying criteria for a borrower are not as strict as conventional  loan financing and the down payment or equity requirements are also less.  To purchase, you can put as little as 3.5%  down. 
                In comparing a purchase money FHA loan against a  conventional loan, FHA loans will allow the borrower who has had a few  "credit problems" or those with limited credit history to buy a home.  An FHA Underwriter will require a reasonable explanation of any derogatory  credit, but will approach a person's credit history with common sense credit  underwriting. Most notably, borrowers with extenuating circumstances  surrounding a bankruptcy that was discharged 2 years ago can be approved for  maximum financing. Conventional financing, on the other hand, would require 4  years to have passed to be eligible for consideration. Also, Conventional loans  rely heavily upon credit scoring. You still may qualify for an FHA loan even if  you don’t meet the minimum score requirements of a Conventional mortgage.
If a borrower does have past credit issues an FHA loan may  be significantly cheaper than an alternative loan such as subprime. These other  programs generally have higher interested rate of require a larger down payment  or Equity position. Many of these alternative loan products have Pre Payment  penalties where as FHA loan do not have such penalties. In fact FHA loans can  be easily refinanced under the Streamline program.
Another advantage of an FHA vs conventional loan is that FHA  is one of the few home mortgage programs that allow a borrower to have their  down payment gifted from a family member, a governmental agency, or non-profit  organization. This allows home buyers without the necessary money to buy a home  today.

Second Home Loan Financing
The underwriting standards for a second home loan can be somewhat  different than what is required for the mortgage on a primary residence. The  lender might require a larger down payment, or add a risk premium to the  mortgage interest rate because the home isn't your primary residence. Because  we have such a large pool of lenders competing for your second home loan, you will get the  best available rate for that second dream home.
                Complete your mortgage pre-approval now, so we can find you  the best available second home mortgage program. 
We are licensed in RI, MA, CT, NH, VT, and ME.

Construction Mortgage Loans
What you need to know about Construction Mortgages
Construction loans and residential mortgages have a lot of  differences. Construction loan lender terms specify short term duration,  interim interest-only repayment and loans are due at the end of the construction  phase. Unlike regular mortgages available for 10, 15 and up to 30 or 40 years,  construction loans have a much shorter life span - 6 months to 2 years with  most commonly 1 year term.
Construction Loan Lender Terms
When the building stage is completed, the construction loan  lender requires that the construction loan is repaid. Some borrowers may have  difficulties arranging permanent financing at the end of the construction  phase. If the borrower locked in a single close construction to permanent loan,  they are at the mercy of the lender unless they find alternative financing and  come up with the cash for the construction loan.
Also, construction loan terms do not follow standardized  rules. Rather, every case is client-specific and the arrangements may vary  greatly. It is said that construction loan terms depend on the story of the  borrower. Every borrower in need of such a loan does have a story - interrupted  construction financing, building a custom house, etc. The land over which  construction is taking place is often considered a collateral for the loan.
Naturally, because of the relative short life those loans  have, borrowers have to be prepared to pay much higher rates on a construction  loan compared to a long term mortgage.
We are licensed in RI, MA, CT, NH, VT, and ME.
We offer more options at the end
When the construction process of your dream home is  completed, your Certified Mortgage Planner will have our pool of lenders  compete for the “end loan”, which is the regular mortgage you obtain after the  home receives an occupancy permit from the town or municipality. You’ll get the  best available rate, we guarantee it! 
Complete your mortgage pre-approval now, so we can find you  the best construction mortgage program. Click here to Apply Now.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

Burton Family
"The uncertainty of a new state, new job and new home are never easy to come to terms with. Although this change is certain as long as you are active members of the military, you can never prepare for the uncertainty that comes along the way. When there are groups and companies out there like the VAMC, it renews the hope that everything will be alright."









Gotts Family
"Working with VAMortgageCenter was fantastic. We got to closing on time. We had a very short deadline to get there and they made it happen for us. Our broker was really knowledgeable with everything going on in the market. He knew when to lock in the interest rate and how to get us to closing fast."

"The uncertainty of a new state, new job and new home are never easy to come to terms with. Although this change is certain as long as you are active members of the military, you can never prepare for the uncertainty that comes along the way. When there are groups and companies out there like the VAMC, it renews the hope that everything will be alright."









Gotts Family
"Working with VAMortgageCenter was fantastic. We got to closing on time. We had a very short deadline to get there and they made it happen for us. Our broker was really knowledgeable with everything going on in the market. He knew when to lock in the interest rate and how to get us to closing fast."

                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LendingTree, LLC has received 4.27 out of 5 stars based on 98 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LoanDepot.com has received 4.4 out of 5 stars based on 617 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Quicken Loans Ranks Highest in Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction for Seventh Consecutive Year


 






COSTA MESA, Calif.: 10 Nov. 2016 — Overall satisfaction scores have increased year over year, but a high percentage of home buyers are remorseful about their mortgage lender selection, according to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study,SM released today.The study shows that 21% of customers purchasing a home express regret over their choice of lender, and 27% of first-time home buyers regret their choice. Among customers who regret their decision, there are two distinct situations.The first situation is customers having a poor experience (overall scores below 600 on a 1,000-point scale), which includes an above-average incidence of problems, lack of communication and unmet promises. While this group’s responses aren’t unexpected, they are often vocal about their displeasure, making an average of 9.0 negative comments, compared with the study average of 0.7.The second situation is more unexpected because satisfaction among these customers is high. This group tends to be very price-focused and frequently obtains multiple quotes. Among customers who regret their lender selection, 72% indicate they were pressured to choose a particular mortgage product. Their final lender choice is often linked to financial reasons, such as getting a lower rate because they have a relationship with the firm (e.g., checking account with direct deposit).“This ‘happy buyer’s remorse’ is in part due to customers feeling that circumstances out of their control drove them to a particular choice and that options weren’t totally clear,” said Craig Martin, director of the mortgage practice at J.D. Power. “Like a lot of consumers, they are happy with a good deal, but they can feel that they have to jump through hoops to get the deal. In the end, they may not fully understand exactly what they got, and the longer-term risk for lenders is that customers’ perceptions of the deal may change in the future.”One potential contributing factor to this condition could be TRID (TILA RESPA Integrated Disclosure[1]).  Over the past two years, much of lenders’ attention has been focused on complying with and minimizing the negative effects of these new requirements, which became effective in October 2015. Lenders have feared that the new requirements would extend an already lengthy process and negatively affect satisfaction. While various sources have reported increases in the total number of days for the lending process, findings of the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study show little change in the perceived speed of the process. Improved communication and setting expectations appropriately have helped prevent negative perceptions.“Whether it is a new regulation, shifting rates or new technology, lenders will continue to face challenges that require them to change,” Martin said. “Regardless of what comes, if lenders focus on the needs of the customer and execute on key best practices they can positively influence perceptions and minimize the negative effects on customers.”Following are some of the key findings in this year’s study:A higher percentage of customers in 2016 indicate their loan representative always called back when promised, compared with last year (85% vs. 81%, respectively), and their loan closed on the desired date (81% vs. 79%).Satisfaction is significantly higher among customers buying a home (840) than among those refinancing (821). In the 2014 and 2015 studies, the levels of satisfaction in these groups were nearly identical.Technology is becoming increasingly important, with 28% of customers indicating they completed their detailed application online, up from 22% in 2015 and 18% in 2014. Study RankingsQuicken Loans ranks highest in primary mortgage origination satisfaction for a seventh consecutive year, with a score of 869. Quicken Loans performs particularly well in the application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; and onboarding factors.CitiMortgage moves up three positions from fifth in 2015 to second this year, with a score of 851.  Ditech Financial, new to the study in 2016, ranks third with a score of 849.Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (+52 points) and Nationstar Mortgage (+50 points) post the most significant year-over-year improvements in overall satisfaction.Advice to ConsumersPlan ahead when researching mortgage options. Satisfaction among customers who wait until they find a home to look into mortgage options is 92 points lower than among those who look into mortgage options before their home search.Take the time to obtain more than one quote. Among the 32% of customers who received just one quote, overall satisfaction is 19 points lower than those who get multiple quotes. Satisfaction is 38 points lower among first-time buyers only getting one quote vs. those who get multiple quotes.Choose a lender based on their merits, not just price or affiliation. Customers who say they chose their lender primarily because of price/rate or based on the recommendation of a realtor/builder are significantly less satisfied than those whose choice is based on other reasons.About the StudyThe 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study measures customer satisfaction with the mortgage origination experience in six factors (listed alphabetically): application/approval process; interaction; loan closing; loan offerings; onboarding; and problem resolution. Satisfaction is calculated on a 1,000-point scale.The study is based on responses from 5,182 customers who originated a new mortgage or refinanced within the past 12 months, and was fielded in July–August 2016.For more information about the 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, visithttp://www.jdpower.com/resource/us-primary-mortgage-origination-satisfaction-study.Media Relations ContactsJohn Tews; Troy, Mich.; 248-868-0621; media.relations@jdpa.comGeno Effler; Costa Mesa, Calif.; 714-621-6224; media.relations@jdpa.comAbout J.D.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
