Your host today will be Mark Kowlzan, Chief Executive Officer of PCA. Upon conclusion of his narrative, there will be a Q&A session.I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kowlzan. And please proceed when you are ready.Mark W. Kowlzan - Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, and thank you for participating in Packaging Corporation of America's second quarter 2015 earnings release conference call.I'm Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA. And with me on the call today are Paul Stecko, our Chairman; Tom Hassfurther, Executive Vice President, who runs our Packaging business; Judy Lassa, Senior Vice President who runs our White Papers business; and Rick West, Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Mundy, who will succeed Rick as CFO effective September 1.I'll begin the call with an overview of our second quarter results and operations, and then I'll turn the call over to Tom, Judy, and Rick, who'll provide more details. During our prepared comments, we'll be referring to slides that are posted on our website. I'll then wrap things up and we'll be glad to take questions.Yesterday, we reported second quarter net income of $114 million or $1.16 per share compared to last year's second quarter net income of $100 million or $1.01 per share. Second quarter net income included net charges for the Boise integration and the DeRidder Louisiana mill restructuring of $2 million or $0.02 per share.Excluding special items, net income was a record $116 million or $1.18 per share compared to last year's net income of $114 million or $1.15 per share. Net sales were $1.5 billion in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2014.As shown on slide four, earnings of $1.18 per share were $0.15 higher than our prior guidance. Higher than guidance earning of $0.06 per share were driven by outstanding operations in both our mills and box plants, especially considering that five of our mills were down during the quarter for their annual outages. The benefits from the work we completed in the first quarter at the DeRidder mill during its extended annual outage were realized faster than we expected.The ability to produce virgin, high-performance linerboard grades on D3, plus the improvements we made on D1, allowed us to make more lightweight containerboard and other specialty grade at DeRidder and shift other grades to accounts in Valdosta mills. This resulted in record productivity on a tons-per-day basis and lower mill cost at all three of these mills.In corrugated products, our sales mix improved seasonally more than we expected, contributing another $0.05 per share. In addition, lower mill outage costs, lower purchased pulp costs, a lower tax rate and other items each contributed an additional $0.01 per share in earnings.Looking at slide five, earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the second quarter of 2014. Production in sales volume increase has added $0.10 per share to earnings, a richer mix in corrugated products increased earnings by $0.02 per share, lower energy costs increased earnings $0.07 per share. Lower chemical costs increased earnings $0.02 per share and a lower tax rate improved earnings over last year's second quarter by about $0.04 per share. These earnings improvements were partially offset by lower white paper prices and mix changes which reduced earnings by $0.10 per share, higher labor and benefit costs of $0.05 per share, lower export containerboard prices of $0.02 per share, higher annual outage costs, $0.03 per share and higher wood costs of $0.02 per share.EBITDA and margins in the packaging segments were up over second quarter of last year, with EBITDA of $267 million and sales of $1.142 billion, or a 23.4% margin compared to the second quarter of 2014 packaging EBITDA of $259 million excluding special items, with sales of $1.145 billion, or a 22.6% margin.Moving into more details of operations. Containerboard production in the second quarter was 937,000 tons, up 91,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter, driven primarily by 79,000 tons or 875 tons per day produced on D3 machine at DeRidder. The D3 machine produced 59,000 tons of linerboard and 20,000 tons of corrugating medium. With the D3 production, we reduced our upside purchases of containerboard by 56,000 tons compared to last year's second quarter. The D3 machine contributed about $0.06 per share to our second quarter earnings.We plan to take our D3 machine down at DeRidder in September for 13 days to install additional dryers, which will provide the capability to achieve full design capacity of 1,000 tons per day and lower cost. We pulled up some work from next year's DeRidder annual outage to better utilize the downtime and also accrue benefits earlier.Our containerboard inventory at the end of the second quarter was down 4,000 tons from year-end levels and about 1,400 tons below the end of the first quarter. Our ending inventory level at the end of the quarter is where we wanted to be to meet our seasonally stronger third quarter demand, especially with the lost production from the planned D3 machine outage in September. Our containerboard inventories at our box plants are also higher than what we've historically carried as a result of transportation issues, which I think most of you are familiar with.Read the rest of this transcript for free on seekingalpha.com

Packaging Corp. of America Names Mark Kowlzan as CEO








  Mark Kowlzan



June 29, 2010 (Press Release) - Packaging Corporation of America announced today that effective July 1, 2010 it will separate the roles of Chairman and CEO into two positions. Paul T. Stecko will remain as Chairman of the Board and an executive officer of the company. He will relinquish his role as CEO to Mark W. Kowlzan, age 55, who has also been named to the company�s board of directors.
As Executive Chairman, Mr. Stecko will focus primarily on major strategic issues and initiatives as well as other important board and shareholder matters. In this regard, Mr. Stecko has entered into a new employment agreement with the company which includes financial incentives that require that he remain with the company until June 30, 2013 to achieve.
Prior to being named CEO, Mr. Kowlzan served PCA for the past ten years as Senior Vice President- Containerboard with responsibility for the company�s containerboard mill operations. Mr. Kowlzan joined PCA in 1996 and has over 25 years experience in the paper and forest products industry serving in a wide variety of technical, manufacturing and leadership positions. His complete biography is attached to this release.
Commenting on the announcement, Mr. Stecko said, �The separation of the Chairman and CEO roles facilitates our succession process, giving Mark Kowlzan overall responsibility for the leadership of the company while allowing me to continue to contribute in important strategic aspects of the business as well as helping ensure a smooth and effective transfer of responsibilities within the organization.�
Mr. Stecko added, �Mark Kowlzan has clearly demonstrated his strong leadership and technical skills by building one of the lowest cost and most efficient containerboard mill systems in the industry. He, along with Tom Hassfurther, our EVP-Corrugated Products, Rick West, our CFO and myself all have over 25 years experience in this industry. I am confident that Mark will be an effective and successful leader who will build upon PCA�s record of producing industry leading results and continue our focus on creating shareholder value.�
PCA is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging products in the United States with sales of $2.15 billion in 2009. PCA operates four paper mills and 68 corrugated product plants in 26 states across the country.

Mark Kowlzan, CEO of PCA, Named RISI North American CEO of the Year
Kowlzan praised for PCA's increase in converter presence
PR Newswire






BOSTON, May 30, 2017


 BOSTON, May 30, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- RISI, the leading information provider for the global forest products industry, today announced that Mark Kowlzan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Packaging Corporation of America (PCA), has been named the 2017 North American CEO of the Year. The award will be presented to Mr. Kowlzan at the North American Conference on October 17, 2017 in Boston, Massachusetts at the Seaport Hotel.
RISI's North American CEO of the Year is nominated by a group of investment analysts and portfolio managers covering the North American and global pulp and paper industry. Analysts credited Kowlzan for growing PCA in containerboard and corrugated packaging – while at the same time operating the firm at the highest EBITDA margin among North American publicly-traded containerboard producers.
In the first quarter this year PCA generated a 21.7% EBITDA margin – the highest among publicly-traded North American containerboard producers. One analyst said that PCA under Kowlzan has "continued to put up best-in-class margins and expand their converting presence. They have maintained a strong balance sheet and with stock at all-time highs are poised for another growth step."
Another credited Kowlzan for "solid integration improvement and attractive M&A" activity. In the last year, PCA spent $486 billion on acquiring two independent converters, TimBar Packaging and Columbus Container. The acquisitions followed the late-2014 conversion of a newsprint machine at its DeRidder, LA, mill to containerboard production. The company also acquired Boise Paper, which operates a containerboard and box unit in the USA, for $1.27 billion in late 2014.
In first-quarter 2017, PCA was the only producer to report higher earnings from its containerboard operations in North America, boosting adjusted EBITDA by 16% to $272 million, compared with its year-ago performance. PCA said its first-quarter box shipments were up 8.9% on a per-day basis. Also, with the acquisitions and additional box-making assets, PCA's containerboard-to-box integration level was at 95%. 
The company also is upgrading the converted D-3 machine in DeRidder, adding about 150,000 tons of incremental linerboard capacity by mid-2018.
 About Mark Kowlzan: 
 Mark W. Kowlzan has served as PCA's Chairman since January 2016 and as Chief Executive Officer and director since July 2010.  From 1998 through June 2010, Mr. Kowlzan led the company's containerboard mill system, first as Vice President and General Manager, and then as Senior Vice President – Containerboard.  From 1996 through 1998, Mr. Kowlzan served in various senior mill-related operating positions with PCA and Tenneco Packaging, including as manager of the Counce linerboard mill.  Prior to joining Tenneco Packaging, Mr. Kowlzan spent 15 years at International Paper Company where he held a series of operational and managerial positions within its mill organization.  
Mr. Kowlzan received an undergraduate degree in Natural Science from Assumption College, an undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering and Pulp and Paper Engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, a graduate degree in Pulp and Paper Engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Lowell and an MBA from the University of Louisiana at Monroe.
