Our Process

Our Process





PROCESS FOR DISCRETIONARY FEE BASED RELATIONSHIPS
Step 1. Interview client to determine if their goals are mutually compatible with our philosophy of investing with an objective of reasonable returns without undue risk.
Step 2. Determine which of our model portfolios would help to achieve the client's goals.

Growth - Invested for potential long-term growth using our value investing style primarily in stocks, mutual funds and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds).
Growth/Income - A more balanced approach invested as above plus using fixed income for a significant percent of the portfolio to potentially lower the risk/volatility.
Equity Income - Invested in dividend paying stocks and preferreds.
Income - Invested in fixed income securities such as bonds, preferred stocks, mutual funds and other income paying investments.
Since each client's portfolio is separately managed, it may or may not be similar to another client with the same objective.
Step 3. Each client is assigned to a partner of the firm as a primary contact in addition to a client service manager and a portfolio manager.
Step 4. Portfolio manager will begin investing client's funds on a discretionary basis according to their objectives and the model chosen.  This process may take up to six months to complete depending on market conditions.
Step 5. Portfolio will be constantly monitored and adjusted as necessary according to the risk model we use.  This model indicates to us times of potentially high and low risk economic and market conditions.  For some, but not all, client portfolios, we may attempt to be fully invested during times when the model indicates lower risk, and may hold larger positions in cash and short-term investments during times of higher risk according to the model.

About Our Firm

About Our Firm





Our Story
Summit Financial was founded by Fred Werner & David Daniel in 2003.  After working with Summit for over 10 years Todd Lambert & Mike Pharr became partners in 2013.  Then, in October 2015 Summit Financial merged with FPL Asset Management out of Monroe, LA.  This acquisition brought in Kenneth Vines & C. Louis Ray’s expertise in the area of ERISA retirement plans as well as value investing which Summit has used throughout its history.  This also allowed Summit Financial to grow it’s footprint in the state of Louisiana.  With the acquisition Summit is now nationally recognized & one of the largest independent firms in Louisiana.
Experience






Founders Fred Werner and David Daniel have 40, and 29 years of experience respectively.
10 members of Summit Financial’s team have over 20 years’ experience in the investment business
We have experience with business owners who have sold their businesses, retirees, ERISA plans, as well as other individual clients.



Professionalism


Our collective group of partners / staff have earned the following advanced degrees and designations: CFP®, CIMA, AIF, AIFA, MS, and MBA.
It will never be our goal to be the cheapest investment group, only the best.






Personalized Service





By knowing our clients personally and not hiring third party money managers from another part of the country, we feel we have a distinct advantage over other advisors.
We manage our own investments and have the ability to personalize portfolios to fit our clients’ needs. 
Our client service/relationship managers have worked closely with clients for many years.  One of them was named one of America’s “Outstanding Sales Assistants” by Registered Rep. magazine



Registered Representative magazine - October 2000 
Mrs. Wright was nominated by her branch manager at Legg Mason. The criteria were: specific instances of exemplary service to clients, brokers and the firm, demonstrated leadership abilities at work and in the community and peer recognition and respect.

A Dynasty Trust is a long-term trust formed to transfer wealth from one generation to another without incurring estate and gift taxes.  The Dynasty Trust’s key characteristic is its duration.  Assuming you take advantage of the laws of a state that has repealed the Rule Against Perpetuities, the principal will never be subject to estate or inheritances taxes.

Most people would argue that living in a digital world, with instant access to an endless stream of information has made us smarter and more empowered than past generations.  Investors believe that it has “leveled the playing field”, enabling them to make investment decisions based on the same information once only available to the investment professionals.

When we let the endowment effect influence our investment decisions, the result is often a portfolio of assets that have outlived their usefulness or are no longer appropriate for our financial situation.  This is especially true as people near retirement and continue to hold on to positions they’ve owned for extended periods of time.

EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENT - Here we grow again!WE ARE MERGING WITH HEIRLOOM WEALTH MANAGEMENT, LLC.We are excited to announce that we are merging with another RIA advisory firm here in Denver, CO that will help us further expand our services and keep us growing for you, our valued customers!

Since we are all Registered Investment Advisors, and LPL Financial is our mutual broker/dealer, we won't skip a beat in serving our customers. Nothing is going to change except our name. Towards the end of 2015, we will merge under our new merged company name, Heirloom Wealth Management, LLC. If you want to know more about us, please visit our partners website below. We look forward to continuing to serve our clients and friends.Heirloom Wealth Management, LLC Welcome to Summit Wealth Advisors, LLCCompanySummit Wealth Advisors, LLC was founded in 2000 with the goal of being a financial advocate to our clients developing comprehensive financial plans, strategies and tools to help pursue their unique goals. We believe proper financial planning starts with a proper level of risk management and is a primary foundation in developing each of our client’s plans. We have proficiently guided many people on their path to financial freedom and look forward to an opportunity to assist you. See more details under our Company tab above.Client First PhilosophyGaining a clear understanding of your needs and goals is the most important first step an advisor should undertake before making any recommendations. Developing comprehensive strategies to address your needs and goals is the second part of the process. No one solution, product or service is right for everyone, "no one size fits all here". It takes time to understand what is important to you, assess your values, understand your cash flow needs and to determine both long and short terms goals before an appropriate wealth plan can be developed specific to you.We believe one of the most important aspects in choosing a Wealth Advisor is the development of a trusting relationship where you work together to pursue your goals. Clear, honest and regular communication is the key to a successful relationship. At Summit Wealth Advisors we can’t stress enough the importance of choosing the right financial partner to work with.Financial Planning, Retirement Planning and Wealth ManagementToday’s financial planning and investing landscape is littered with an alphabet soup of titles. From self-management websites to investment companies touting their wears, to websites where people can supposedly invest and plan out their entire financial lives without any professional guidance. We see many who have fallen prey to that trap either trying to save money or attempting do it themselves in their spare time.But for those that realize that financial planning and wealth management are more than just running some financial projections or picking an asset allocation, there is an opportunity to realize their true wealth potential. We are your coach, your advisor, and your accountability partner. We help you stay focused on your plans and work with you to monitor and adjust them when life’s circumstances throws curve balls at your plans. We work with you to help you manage your wealth, not just invest it, but to help ensure you have appropriate estate plans, risk management and distribution strategies in place.You’ll experience the difference at Summit Wealth Advisors. With the challenging economic conditions and market swings, we advocate investing with smart risk management processes that can help you pursue your goals. We work with you to develop a strategic investment & wealth preservation plan which specifically address to your needs. More importantly, we work side by side with you to implement your strategy and systematically review our progress against your plans.
