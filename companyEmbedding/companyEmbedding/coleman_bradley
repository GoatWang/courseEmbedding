Bradley also known as Andrew Cecil Bradley was a literary critic and a professor of literature and poetry at the Universities of Liverpool, Glasgow and Oxford. He is also known as one of the most renowned Shakespeare critics. Bradley was born in Surrey on March 26th, 1851. He was the youngest of 21 children from his father Charles Bradley who was vicar (title given to certain parish priests in the Church of England) of Glasbury. Bradley began his education at Cheltenham College in 1864 and went to Balliol College, Oxford as a classic exhibitioner in 1869. In 1874 he was elected to his fellowship at Balliol and later he was appointed to lecturer in English and then later in philosophy, where he remained until 1881. (Gifford Lectures, pars. 1-2).In 1882, Bradley became the first to hold the chair or literature and history at the University College, Liverpool. He held that position for 8 years and eventually moved on to Glasgow University where he was chair of English and literature. In 1900 he had intended to retire but in 1901 he became a professor at Oxford for poetry. In 1904 he published his famous work of the Shakespearean Tragedy. After, he decided to officially go into retirement and devoted himself to his scholarly work. Bradley died on September 2nd, 1935 and in his will he established a research fellowship for young scholars of English letters. (Gifford Lectures, pars 3-4).A.C. Bradley's Criticism A.C. Bradley's 1904 criticism of Hamlet has been regarded as one of the most influential and eminent lectures of the early 1900's. His main focus in his criticism of Hamlet was the famed problem of Hamlet's delay. Many people believe that Hamlet's delay in the killing of Claudius is because of external forces, such as the risks of moving ahead with only the ghost's words for it and the need to bring the King to public justice thus the need to expose the King's guilt in front of the entire court. Bradley believes that this theory is completely possible until one actually reads the play. Hamlet never describes any type of external obstacles in the proceeding's of the ghost's instructions, he assumes that he has the rights and means to carry out those instructions, never once did Hamlet say that he wanted to bring Claudius down in public. (Leithart, par. 1).Another theory that Bradley believes attributes to Hamlet's delay is his conscience. Hamlet believes that killing Claudius is a moral duty, however one might believe that Hamlet is subconsciously ambivalent about this duty. Bradley writes, “In the depths of his nature, and unknown to himself, there was a moral repulsion to the deed.” Bradley considers the thought that perhaps Hamlet was confused about the morality of the situation. (Leithart, par. 2). Bradley also considers the sentimental view of Hamlet. Hamlet is meant to be portrayed as a hero. However Bradley begs to differ pointing out that Hamlet freely insults Claudius, ran rings around Polonius, is vicious with Ophelia and his mother Gertrude and cheerfully sends Guildenstern and Rosencrantz off to their deaths in England. Something that is similar to Bradley's theory was famous critics of Hamlet, Coleridge and Schlegel. They believed that Hamlet delayed because he was intellectual and “who loses himself in the labyrinth of thought.” By: Kirsten ColemanBradley also proposes that perhaps the delay of Hamlet is all due to his melancholic emotions. This was not his usual state of mind, it is not a habitual state of reflectiveness but a temporary state of depression that paralyzes his mind. Bradley gives off the impression that he believes that Hamlet is bi-polar when he says, “One would judge that by temperament, he was inclined to nervous instability, too rapid and perhaps extreme changes of feeling and mood and that he was disposed to be, for the time, absorbed in the feeling or mood that possessed him, whether it was joyous or depressed.” (Bradley, par. 12). Hamlet's case of melancholia was brought on by the strain of the sudden death of his father and the quick marriage of his mother. So, when the ghost comes with his proposition of killing Claudius, Hamlet is not in the proper state of health mentally to fully understand the compounds of that proposition.  Bradley writes, “Hamlet is disgusted by life and everything in it, a disgust that varies in intensity, rising at times for a longing of death, often sinking into a weary apathy.” (Bradley, par. 16)  This quote explains a multitude of things, his bursts of energy (when the players show up), it accounts for his often irritability, his transitional crazy emotions. It also accounts for the fact that Hamlet doesn't understand his own in action and reproaches himself in dismay over his unwillingness to avenge his father. Critical Assessments of Hamlet- Dramatic Structure- Feminism- Religion- Madness- Philosophy- Psychoanalytic Dramatic StructureHamlet was seen as a very controversial play. Shakespeare had broken quite a few rules in the making of this play. One of the rules had been the rule of action of over character. What is meant by this is back in Shakespeare's time plays were intended to the certain regime. In drama, you were not supposed to focus on a character as much as you did the action, however Hamlet is solely based on the character Hamlet himself through his soliloquies and his moral struggles that we witness. The play is also filled with discontinues and irregularities for example one instant Hamlet is resolved to kill Claudius the next he is unsure. Scholars still to this day wonder whether these irregularities are  mistakes or purposely put there to add to the chaos and confusion of the play. (MacCary, 67-72).FeminismMany feminist critics believe that since Hamlet believes that his mother is a trollop due to her sudden marriage to Claudius, he loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she were a trollop as well. (Howard, 411-415).Many women over the years have defended Gertrude believing that Gertrude knew nothing about her new husband Claudius poisoning her dead husband Hamlet. It has been said that many men have misinterpreted Gertrude, believing what Hamlet says instead of the actual text of the play. There is no clear evidence that Gertrude was an adulteress. (Bloom, 58-59).Feminists also believe that after the three supreme role models, Polonuis, Laretes and Hamlet leave, Ophelia was driven into madness. (Showalter, par 3). It is also said the Ophelia went mad with guilt because after Hamlet killed her father, it fulfilled her sexual desire of Hamlet killing her father so that they can be together. (Bloom, 57).ReligionHamlet the play also deals with various encounters with religion. In Catholicism, the ghost describes himself as being slain without receiving his last rites. The ghost also reveals that he has been living in purgatory, “I am thy father's spirit, Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And in the day, confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature, are burnt and purg'd away.” (Shakespeare. 1.5.9-13) Another occurrence in Catholicism is in regards to Ophelia's burial. They question whether it'd be appropriate to have a Christian burial since those who commit suicide are guilty of their own murder. So the real question is whether Ophelia committed suicide or not. We do not come to a conclusion in Ophelia's death so the priest tells Laretes that they can not give Ophelia a full ceremony because they don't know if she committed suicide. (Quinlan, 6)MadnessOne of the most critical themes in Hamlet is madness. The question in everybody's mind is Hamlet really crazy or is it just an antic-disposition. Some would argue either way. Scholars compare Hamlet to the Earl of Essex, who was executed for attempting to start a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Hamlet and the Earl of Essex have been analyzed for it's Elizabethan ideas of madness relating to treason. The Earl of Essex seemed crazy to Elizabethans and admitted to insanity before his death. Hamlet may as well have been truly insane as well or at least perhaps in the Elizabethan sense. (Wofford, Par. 3-8). PhilosophySkepticism: The theory that certain knowledge is impossible. Relativism: Doctrine that knowledge, truth, morality exist in relation to culture, society or historical context, and are not absolute. Existentialism: A philosophical theory which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of free will.  Hamlet is seen as a philosophical character. Some of the most prominent theories linked to philosophy are relativism, existentialism and skepticism. Hamlet proves that there is a relative philosophy when he says to Rosencrantz, “there is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so.” (Shakespeare. 2.2. 268-270). The idea that nothing is real, except for what we create in our minds comes from Greece. The people believed that nothing could be perceived except through their senses and all men were different, so truth is relative. An example of existentialism is in the famous, 'To be or not to be,' speech. To be can be read as a question of existence. Hamlet's contemplation of suicide, is however more religious than philosophical and he believes he will continue to exist after death. Finally an example of skepticism can be proven in one of Hamlet's soliloquy, where it states “what is this quintessence of dust?” (Shakespeare. 2.2.264-274) During this soliloquy Hamlet goes on about how intelligent man kind is however there will always be something to be learned. PsychoanalysisSigmund Freud suggests that Claudius has shown Hamlet the repressed wishes of his own childhood realized which is to kill his own father and to take his father's place with his mother. With these images Hamlet realizes that he is no better than the sinner whom he will punish. (Freud, 367)The closet scene in Hamlet is portrayed in a sexual light when Hamlet scolds his mother for having sex with Claudius while unconsciously wishing that he could take Claudius' place. Adultery and incest is what Hamlet hates and loves about his mother. Freud also believed that Ophelia's madness after her father's death was driven by her hoped-for lover. (Freud, 368).Freud also makes a connection with the play and William Shakespeare's real life. When Hamlet was written it was in the wake of his own father's death which revived his own repressed childhood wishes.

Franchise Spotlight: Coleman Bradley, Sonic | Direct Capital | Blog           Search for:        Franchise Spotlight: Coleman Bradley, Sonic  August 27, 2015By Alex Haberland    Reading Time: 2 minutesHow does one go from the real estate business to franchising? Just ask Coleman Bradley – a real estate investor and developer turned 14-year Sonic franchisee.When he moved from Dallas, Texas to North Carolina in 1999, Bradley knew he wanted a cash-flow business, something different than the project-by-project nature of the real estate world. He was familiar with the Sonic concept and menu, and knew it had a good product matched with good customer service. When he saw the opportunity to open a Charlotte, North Carolina store in 2001, he took it. Since then, he has opened nine additional stores in the greater North Carolina area.Bradley and Direct CapitalBradley first met Matt Goyette, Direct Capital’s Vice President of Major Accounts, in September 2013 at the Sonic Convention in San Diego.Goyette said Bradley was “skeptical” at first, because of prior experiences with lenders, but still Bradley listened to how Direct Capital’s process worked. Bradley said, “It was kind of a test. I did what Matt told me to do. It was very simple.”Wanting to retrofit five of his existing restaurants, he knew he needed capital. That’s where Direct Capital was able to help.Bradley is a good businessman he continuously wants to make upgrades and purchases that make, as he calls it, “business sense.” Some of those upgrades include retrofits and renovations on his stores. With the funds obtained through Direct Capital, Bradley was able to renovate the exteriors of the building, improving curb appeal, increasing traffic, and lowering overall maintenance costs.And because the first five retrofits worked out so well, Bradley said he plans on using Direct Capital for the sixth one he will do in 2015.Direct Capital Financing Process“It was simple,” Bradley said, “It was a quick approval and document signing takes minutes.”But it’s not only the process Bradley advocates for; it’s the products, too. Because Sonic is a very seasonal business, he said the working capital from Direct Capital enabled him to smooth out cash flow.“It’s a very good product,” Bradley said of Direct Capital’s small business loan, “I like it.”He said that the retrofits, made possible with the working capital he received, has helped him increase sales and traffic across all of his stores. Though there are a lot of factors that go into it, he said, “I’ve got to believe that with the improvement of the buildings, there’s no question the money we got from Direct Capital played an important part.”The FutureBradley said he’s definitely open to the idea of opening more stores. “There’s a possibility to expand,” he said,” I’m always looking for opportunities if the numbers work.”But, in his current stores, there are certain projects that need completing first. Sonic is rolling out new POS upgrades and POPS systems (Point of Personalized Service) and Bradley’s stores are set to have those installed in mid- to late-2016.The POP system, a digitized drive-in menu that includes a screen with dynamic content on a loop, and the POS upgrade are two more projects Bradley plans to finance through Direct Capital.Why? “Three reasons,” he said, “Everybody does what they say they’re going to do. The simplicity. And if I ever need anyone, everyone is right there.”To discover ways that Direct Capital can help your franchise grow like Coleman’s, visit our Franchise Financing page!
