About







TARGETING METABOLIC DISEASE THROUGH ADVANCES IN ENDOCRINE RESEARCH
Metacrine is a biotech company developing innovative therapeutics for metabolic diseases. The company is led by an experienced management team and backed by leading institutional investors. Founded in 2015, Metacrine’s initial technology was licensed from the laboratory of Dr. Ronald Evans, a world leader in nuclear hormone receptors and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at the Salk Institute.
The current focus of the company is to develop novel therapeutics for significant metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). There are over 30 million type 2 diabetics in the United States and despite numerous available drug classes, close to 50% of patients are unable to achieve target HbA1c levels and glucose control. Similarly, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is reaching epidemic proportions in the US and worldwide, with nearly 20% of Americans having some stage of fatty liver disease. Currently, there is no approved therapy for NASH.
Metacrine will leverage two mechanistically distinct programs to target type 2 diabetes, NASH and other metabolic diseases and liver disorders.

Ronald Evans, PhD
Independent Director, Founder
Ronald Evans is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Director of the Gene Expression Laboratory at the Salk Institute. He is known for his discoveries of nuclear receptors and the mechanism of hormone signaling. Hormone receptors help to control sugar, salt, calcium and fat metabolism as well as reproductive physiology. These receptors are primary targets in the treatment of breast cancer, prostate cancer and leukemia, as well as osteoporosis, inflammation and asthma. His initial isolation of steroid receptors uncovered a hidden ‘superfamily’ of hormone receptors whose characterization revealed the existence of previously unknown signaling pathways for cholesterol, bile acids and fatty acids, fundamentally changing our views of both physiology and the treatment of disease such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. His work led to the development of Panretin, Targretin in leukemia (Ligand Pharmaceuticals) as well as Lasofoxifene and Bazedoxifene (Pfizer) (for osteoporosis and hormone replacement therapy). He was a cofounder of X-Ceptor Therapeutics, a company that developed compounds targeting orphan nuclear receptors for the treatment of metabolic diseases, which was acquired by Exelixis in 2004. He was a consultant for the development of Aragon ARN-509 and Seragon ARN-810 for prostate and breast cancer respectively. He is a founder of MitoBridge in Boston developing drugs to boost mitochondrial function and Xtuit (building drugs to target the tumor microenvironment). His current work focuses on energy metabolism in muscle (exercise in a pill), along with new insights into obesity, insulin resistance and cancer. He is a Professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and holds the March of Dimes Chair in Developmental and Molecular Biology at the Salk Institute and a Research Scholar of the Lustgarten Foundation for pancreatic cancer. He is the recipient of the Albert Lasker Award (2004), the Wolf Prize, Israel (2012) and a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine.

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Metacrine, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on developing innovative therapeutics in metabolic disease through advances in endocrine research, today announced the appointment of Ken Song, M.D., as its new president, chief executive officer and director.  Dr. Song was most recently co-founder and chief executive officer of Ariosa Diagnostics, which was acquired by Roche in 2015 for $625 million.








"Ken's proven leadership, track record and broad expertise serving the life science community over the last several years will build on Metacrine's progress as it continues to advance its therapeutic pipeline and drive to important milestones," said Richard Heyman, chairman of the board of directors of Metacrine. "We are very excited about the prospects of the company's evolution under Ken's leadership as the company progresses toward the clinical advancement of its programs."
Dr. Song's experience spans clinical medicine, basic science research, venture capital, and entrepreneurship.  As co-inventor of Ariosa's flagship product he successfully led the organization from early research to product development to commercialization in over 100 countries. Prior to Ariosa, Dr. Song was a venture capital investor at Venrock and served as a consultant at McKinsey & Company. Dr. Song trained in internal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and then went on to specialize in gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of Washington along with a scientific fellowship at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. He received his B.S. in Biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and his M.D. from the University of California, San Francisco.
"I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to lead Metacrine and work with an outstanding team and group of investors," said Dr. Song. "With the company's two mechanistically distinct programs targeting large clinical needs, I believe Metacrine has the potential to bring forth novel medicines that can positively impact tens of millions of people."
