TCW Direct Lending

Alternative Products Division
In December 2012, TCW purchased the Special Situations Fund Group (SSF) from Regiment Capital Advisors, LP, an independent investment manager based in Boston. TCW Direct Lending is a senior secured lender that targets middle market companies with an emphasis on proprietary deal sourcing, attractive risk-adjusted returns and the preservation of capital. It is overseen by a dedicated investment team led by 22-year industry veteran Rick Miller.

Strategy
The TCW Direct Lending strategy targets middle market companies and provides debt capital for a variety of needs, including LBOs, refinancings, acquisitions, general growth, liquidity and recapitalizations.   Many middle market borrowers don’t have access to the public fixed income and broadly-syndicated loan markets and must rely on conventional middle market banks and non-conventional debt providers like TCW Direct Lending for debt capital. Others simply require timely execution or a higher degree of certainty in closing.   TCW Direct Lending typically can close a transaction more quickly than a conventional bank and the sourcing, structuring, and execution expertise of the TCW Direct Lending investment professionals allow TCW Direct Lending to commit to a financing providing greater certainty for the borrower.  Generally, TCW Direct Lending does not participate in broadly syndicated transactions. Instead, TCW Direct Lending professionals structure highly tailored instruments to meet the needs of borrowers. These investments are typically senior secured obligations which rank higher than unsecured, subordinated or mezzanine debt in the capital structure providing greater capital preservation for the fund’s limited partners.  
Overview
TCW Direct Lending partners with senior management teams, financial intermediaries, business owners, asset-based lenders, and financial sponsors to provide customized financing solutions.  The TCW Direct Lending strategy can make individual investments up to approximately $150 million, with typical investments ranging in size from $20 million to $100 million. Investments are normally structured as first- or second-lien secured financings, including unitranche structures. In the unitranche structure, TCW Direct Lending typically invests in conjunction with an asset-based lender who takes a first-lien, first-out position on the collateral and provides TCW Direct Lending with a first-lien, last-out position on the same collateral. This structure provides a competitive edge for the senior bank lender—who with TCW Direct Lending's participation can offer to meet all of a company’s financing needs beyond the typical borrowing base formula—and a competitive interest rate for the borrower. By presenting one rate to the borrower but reallocating the pricing between TCW Direct Lending and the bank, the strategy is able to provide enhanced returns to its limited partners. 
Investment Team
The TCW Direct Lending team is a group of senior investment professionals, all of whom have extensive capital market experience, including transaction origination, structuring, negotiation, due diligence, and portfolio management in the public and private markets across a wide spectrum of securities and industries. TCW Direct Lending has a track record of closing deals on time and on the terms proposed. The strategy is committed to being a long-term, creative and value-enhancing partner.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.

2016 Year-End Distribution


            As disclosed in the annual report and SAI, distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP accounting. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, market discount and premium, losses deferred due to wash sales, excise tax regulations and employing equalization in determining amounts to be distributed to fund shareholders.
