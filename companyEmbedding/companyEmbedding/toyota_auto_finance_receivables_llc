Re:           
Toyota Auto Receivables 2010-C Owner Trust

 

Ladies and
Gentlemen:

 

We have
acted as special counsel to Toyota Auto Finance Receivables LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (the “Depositor”) in
connection with the sale by the Depositor and the purchase by the
Underwriters (as defined below) of $307,700,000 aggregate principal
amount of 0.51% Asset Backed Notes, Class A-2 (the “Class A-2
Notes”), $347,100,000 aggregate principal amount of 0.77%
Asset Backed Notes, Class A-3 (the “Class A-3 Notes”),
and $100,200,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.09% Asset Backed
Notes, Class A-4 (the “Class A-4 Notes” and
collectively with the Class A-2 Notes and the Class A-3 Notes, the
“Underwritten Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the
Underwriting Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2010 (the
“Underwriting Agreement”), among Barclays Capital Inc.,
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as
representatives of the several underwriters identified therein
(collectively, the “Underwriters”), Toyota Motor Credit
Corporation and the Depositor.

 

In
connection with the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Notes and
$495,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 0.33353% Asset Backed
Notes, Class A-1 (the “Class A-1 Notes”) and
$44,400,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.78% Asset Backed Notes,
Class B (the “Class B Notes” and, together with the
Class A-1 Notes and the Underwritten Notes, the
“Notes”), the Depositor has prepared a prospectus
supplement dated September 22, 2010 (the “Prospectus
Supplement”).  In this opinion letter, the
Prospectus Supplement and the related prospectus dated September
20, 2010 (the “Base Prospectus”), including any
documents and other information incorporated therein by reference,
each in the form prepared for use by the Underwriters (as defined
herein) in confirming sales of the Underwritten Notes, are together
called the “Prospectus.”  Toyota Auto
Receivables 2010-C Owner Trust (the “Issuer”) was
formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement, dated as of July 20, 2010,
between the Depositor and Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company,
National Association, as owner trustee (the “Owner
Trustee”), as amended and restated by the Amended and
Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of September 29, 2010, between
the same parties.

 

The
Depositor has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a
registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-168098),
as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto, for the registration of the
Notes and certain other securities under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).  In
this opinion letter, the foregoing registration statement, as so
amended, at its effective date, including any documents and other
information incorporated therein by reference, is called the
“Registration Statement.”  As set forth in
the Prospectus, the Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture,
dated as of September 29, 2010 (the “Indenture”),
between the Issuer and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
indenture trustee (in such capacity, the “Indenture
Trustee”) and securities intermediary.

 

This
opinion is being furnished in accordance with the requirements of
Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Securities
Act.  No opinion is expressed herein as to any matter
pertaining to the contents of the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus other than as to the entitlement of the Notes to the
benefits of the Indenture and their enforceability against the
Issuer in accordance with their terms.

 

As such
counsel, we have examined and relied upon originals or copies of
such corporate records, documents, agreements or other instruments
of the Depositor as we consider appropriate.  As to all
matters of fact, we have entirely relied upon certificates of
officers of the Depositor and of public officials, and have
assumed, without independent inquiry, the accuracy of those
certificates.  In connection with this opinion, we have
also examined and relied upon the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus.  In our examination, we have assumed the
genuineness of all signatures, the conformity to the originals of
all documents reviewed by us as copies, the authenticity and
completeness of all original documents reviewed by us in original
or copy form, and the legal competence of each individual executing
any document.

 

Each
opinion set forth below relating to the binding effect of the Notes
is subject to the following general qualifications:

 




 



(i)



the
enforceability of any obligation of the Issuer or otherwise may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium, marshalling or other laws and rules
affecting the enforcement generally of creditors’ rights and
remedies (including such as may deny giving effect to waivers of
debtors’ or guarantors’ rights); and




 




 



(ii)



the
enforcement of any rights may in all cases be subject to an implied
duty of good faith and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or
in equity).




 

This
opinion letter is limited solely to the internal, substantive laws
of the State of New York as applied by courts located in New York
without regard to choice of law.

 

Based upon
and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes,
when duly authorized by all requisite statutory trust action on the
part of the Issuer, executed by the Owner Trustee and authenticated
by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with the Indenture, and, in
the case of the Underwritten Notes, delivered against payment in
accordance with the Underwriting Agreement will be entitled to the
benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Issuer in
accordance with their terms.

 

We hereby
consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement and to the references to this firm under the
headings “Legal Opinions” in the Base Prospectus and in
the Prospectus Supplement.  In rendering the foregoing
opinions and giving such consent, we do not admit that we are
“experts” within the meaning of the Securities
Act.

 

 Very
truly yours,

 

 /s/
Bingham McCutchen LLP

 (i)           A
certificate of good standing for the Trust, dated September 28,
2010 obtained from the Secretary of State.

 

We have
not reviewed any documents other than the foregoing documents for
purposes of rendering our opinions as expressed
herein.  In particular, we have not reviewed any document
(other than the foregoing documents) that is referred to in or
incorporated by reference into any document reviewed by

ITEM 15. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
�����Toyota Motor Credit Corporation (�TMCC�) was incorporated as a California
corporation. Section�317 of the California Corporations Code authorizes a
corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to
be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of
the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor) by reason of the fact that
such person is or was an officer or director of the corporation, against
expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and
reasonably incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in
good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best
interests of the corporation and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the conduct of such person was unlawful.

�����Toyota Auto Finance Receivables LLC (�TAFR LLC�) was organized as a
Delaware limited liability company. Section�18-108 of the Delaware
Corporations Code authorizes a limited liability company to indemnify and hold
harmless any member or manager or other person from and against any and all
claims and demands whatsoever.

�����TMCC�s Bylaws authorize TMCC to indemnify their officers and directors to
the maximum extent permitted by the California Corporations Codes. TAFR LLC�s
limited liability company agreement authorizes TAFR LLC to indemnify its
members and managers to the maximum extent permitted by the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act; however, if TAFR LLC has outstanding any securities
rated by a rating agency, its indemnification obligations shall be fully
subordinated to payments of amounts then due on the rated securities and, in
any case, (x)�nonrecourse to TAFR LLC�s assets pledged to secure the rated
securities and (y)�not constitute a claim against TAFR LLC to the that it does
not have funds sufficient to pay the indemnification obligations.

ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS
(a)����As to Rule�415: The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

�����(1)� To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made of
the securities registered hereby, a post-effective amendment to this
registration statement:




�������
(i)
��
to include any prospectus required by Section�10(a)(3) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended;


�


�������
(ii)
��
to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after
the effective date of this registration statement (or the most recent
post-effective amendment hereof) which, individually or in the
aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth
in this registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total
dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was
registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the
estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of
prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule�424(b) if, in
the aggregate, the change in volume and price represent no more than
20�percent change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in
the �Calculation of Registration Fee� table in the effective
registration statement; and

�������
(iii)
��
to include any material information with respect to the plan of
distribution not previously disclosed in this registration statement
or any material change to such information in this registration
statement.


�����(2)� That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each such post-effective amendment shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

�����(3)� To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any
of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of
the offering.

(b)����As to documents subsequently filed that are incorporated by reference: The
undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of determining any
liability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each filing of the
registrant�s annual report pursuant to Section�13(a) or Section�15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an
employee benefit plan�s annual report pursuant to Section�15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as amended, that is incorporated by reference
in this registration statement shall be deemed to be a new registration
statement relating to the securities offered herein, and the offering of such
securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial BONA FIDE offering
thereof.

(c)����As to indemnification: Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors,
officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the provisions
described under Item�15 above, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised
that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

(d)����As to Rule�430A: The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:

�����(1)� For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the information omitted from the form of prospectus as part
of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule�430A and contained in a
form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule�424(b)(1) or (4)�or
497(h) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shall be deemed to be part
of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.

�����(2)� For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of
prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time
shall be deemed to be the initial BONA FIDE offering thereof.

(e)����As to qualifications of trust indentures under the Trust Indenture Act of
1939 for delayed offerings: The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to
file an application for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the
trustee to act under subsection (a)�of Section�310 of the Trust Indenture Act
of 1939, as amended, in accordance with the rules and regulations prescribed by
the Commission under Section�305(b)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended.
