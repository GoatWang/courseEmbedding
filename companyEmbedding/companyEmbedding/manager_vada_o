Vada Manager
Senior Counselor







		        
              
             	
            
                   Vada O. Manager, senior counselor in APCO Worldwide’s Washington, D.C., office is a premier global business and communication strategist with particular expertise in sport and product marketing, branding and positioning, crisis management, litigation communication, government relations and issues management.

Before joining APCO in 2010, Mr. Manager was founder and CEO of Manager Global Consulting Group, an independent consultancy based in Phoenix, Ariz. Prior to founding Manager Global Consulting, he was senior director of global issues management for Nike, Inc., where his broad portfolio of responsibilities included labor practices/global sourcing procedures; marketing communication support for subsidiaries; and crisis management for athletes, product recalls and corporate issues. During his 12-year tenure, he served on the launch team of nike.com, strategized on new business acquisitions such as the Converse and Starter brands, was one of the early architects of Nike's renewed corporate responsibility strategy, and served as a member of the corporate leadership team, Nike's most highly valued team of global executives. He was Nike's senior crisis and issues strategist on issues such as the Olympics, the World Cup, and company response and business resumption after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 

Prior to joining Nike, Mr. Manager was senior manager of global communications for Levi Strauss & Co, providing strategic communication counsel to the global leadership team as the company successfully launched and expanded its Dockers and SLATES brands. He was also a vice president at Powell Tate, where he co-managed accounts for key clients such as the PGA Tour, Major League Baseball and Court TV. While there, he also consulted the African National Congress in their transition to power in South Africa under newly elected President Nelson Mandela with sponsorship from the Kaiser Family Foundation. 

Earlier in his career, Mr. Manager served as vice president of public finance for Young Smith & Peacock, an investment banking firm and registered broker with the New York Stock Exchange, and as a senior communication professional on the team administering the Democratic National Convention (1992, 1996 and 2004) and the Commission on President Debates (1992-1996).

A frequent presenter on business strategy and his pioneering concept of “issue marketing,” Mr. Manager has appeared on CNN and NBC’s The Today Show and has been quoted in various thought-leading global print publications. He has affiliations with several national and global organizations, including the American Council on Germany; the U.S. Military Academy (West Point)'s Civilian Public Affairs Committee (chair, 2008-present); the Issue Management Council (chair, 2007-2009); and the Arizona State University Alumni Council. Mr. Manager also serves on the board of directors for Ashland, Inc., a $10-billion Fortune 500 chemical company, and in 2016 was recognized by Savoy Magazine as one of the Most Outstanding Black Corporate Directors. 

Mr. Manager holds a Bachelor of Science from the Arizona State University and is an inductee in its Hall of Fame (College of Liberal Arts, 2000). He also undertook post-graduate (non-degree) study at the London School of Economics.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
