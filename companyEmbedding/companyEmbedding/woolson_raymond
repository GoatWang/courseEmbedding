	WOOLSON, RAYMOND ANDREW, 18, of Cape May Court House, NJ, passed away on Wednesday, December 2, 2015. Born in Cape May Court House, he lived in Kansas for seven years before moving back here in 2011.
 Raymond was a member of the Junior Rifleman Club. He enjoyed photography and playing video games.
 Raymond loved to work with his hands. He could make neat creations out of anything. Christmas Day, he put together an erector crane set. He liked to figure things out. His creative mind was always clicking.
	He worked with his Pop Pop and all the customers loved him, especially senior ladies. They always fussed over him and gave him tips.
	He was a wonderful young man full of life and will be greatly missed with a hole left in our hearts no one else could fill.
 Raymond is survived by his parents, Chuck and Ramona Woolson; his sisters, Sarah and Lydia Woolson; his grandparents, Raymond and Doreen Verity; and his aunts, uncles, and cousins.
	Funeral services will be held on Monday, December 7, 2015 at 11:00 a.m. at Good Samaritan Baptist Church, 305 Town Bank Road, North Cape May, NJ 08204, where viewing will begin at 10:00 a.m. Interment will be in Goshen Methodist Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to www.gofundme.com/raywoolson.
