Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

            Listed in Born to Shop


I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

I received the best customer service today at the New York & Company store located at the Great Mall in Milpitas.  

I was shopping around for some tops, leggings and pants and I popped into New York & Company because they sent me a coupon for my birthday last week.  I thought to myself, "Shoot, I have no problem creating an excuse to go shopping for new clothes," so off I went.

I was perusing the store and looking for my size and a young lady asked me if I needed any help finding my look or my size.  I usually do not ask for help, but I am not too familiar with this store so the offer for assistance was warmly welcomed.  

I shared with her that I needed a 4 "regular" and all I could find were either "tall" or "petite" or larger sizes so I thought I was out of luck.  She looked and we did not find my size, so she quickly offered me a different fitting pant.  She found exactly what I was looking for, even though I did not know it until I tried her suggestion.  Perfect fit!  And this was a look I have never tried.  

As I was in the dressing room trying on other items, she knocked on the door and shared with me that she had found a smaller size in the original pant I wanted to try and did I want to see if they fit.  I thought, "No, they will be too tight," But she was persistent that I should try, so I acquiesced and decided to try her suggestion.  

Wow! Was I happy I did--another perfect fit.

It is not often that I like everything I take into a dressing room, but today was a wonderful "win" in the clothing department.

When I arrived at the register to pay, the girl working the register rang me up, I paid and then a little note came up on the credit/debit machine that read something about: "Look for your birthday discount" and it was at that moment I remembered my discount birthday card that New York & Company sent me last week, daaaaang ;(

The cashier told me that those discounts do not apply to "previous purchases" and I could not use it, but I thought, "That is kind of weird, since the 'previous purchase' was less than 15 seconds ago, why can she not delete my purchase and apply my discount?"  She called for her manager, Anna, and that is when the wonderful girl who helped me in the back came up and totally solved the problem--in less than one minute.  

Not only is Anna the best clothing consultant, she is the greatest manager too.  Thank you Anna for your kindness, wonderful attitude and great fashion sense, I have decided to become a New York & Company regular because of you--at the Milpitas location--even though it took me an hour to drive there.  Service, like the service provided to me by Anna, is worth a long drive.

This is a great outlet store to get your business causal and just business attire! The store seems to be always on some kind of sale since it is an outlet store. It's a pretty decent sized store that caters to all your business attire needs! They offer items from dress shirts, cardigans, dresses, dress pants and also some causal attire like t-shirts. 

Just a note: their sizing is a little different. I usually wear a M for dress shirts but for some reason, a XS fits perfectly and a S is a little loose on me. So I guess their clothing runs big. But! That's only for the dress shirts. I have yet to try their other clothing. 

I would definitely be coming back because it's a great place to get your typical work clothes at an affordable price.







I have a love hate relationship with NY&C. I always seem to find really good deals online and then I spend all my money...then I feel sad and happy all at the same time. Today I stumbled into the store and was greeted by a very friendly employee. She told me about the extra % off for all items and an extra 25% on clearance. Well I beelined to the clearance and found myself a cute sweater and new work pants! All for $30-ish dollars...what a steal!

It's just a shame that they don't order things by size at all. So unless you have the time or patience to sift through racks of clothes, I probably wouldn't be back. I was just lucky to find the items I did.







New York and Company specializes mainly in women's business attire. This location is more of an outlet, so the clothes are well-priced -- especially when you manage to walk in on a store-wide sale. Today, NY&C was on its last day of the Columbus Weekend Sale, and I made sure to take full advantage of the mark-downs.

One of the best things about shopping at the Great Mall's NY&C has to be the amazing service the staff provides. While I did not manage to catch the names of the girls that assisted me, they have my eternal gratitude for helping make my day's shopping experience wonderful. 

The staff will ensure that your time spent in the store is pain-free. They will offer to take your items and reserve a dressing room for you. When you're trying things on in the dressing room, they frequently stop by to see if you need a different size or color. 

In addition to having an awesome staff, the store's layout is incredibly well organized. Clothing is easy to find, and there's always a multitude of sizes. Also, since NY&C's focus is women's business attire, you can pick up all your fashion essentials (skirt, pants, blouse, blazer, dress, etc) here. 

All-in-all, today's experience  has guaranteed my continued patronage.







Can you say no place to wait awful customer service ?   So you go to buy clothes and while you are waiting for your partner to try on clothes you sit on the floor.  They tell you not allowed.  Hummm.  Why ?  We can't.  I guess it's their store and hence their policies but this one is plain dumb.







How are you not going to have cash in your register & on a holiday weekend like Mother's day? I've worked in retail & know your susposed to have back up change. Not leave your cash paying customes waiting in line while you run to the bank to get change.







I'd never before shopped in a New York & Co outlet Store. I was surprised that the prices weren't lower. Sweaters for $20 in an outlet the day after Christmas wasn't the best deal in town. The jewelry was all marked down to $5.99 each but that wasn't something that I haven't seen before in their regular store. 
All in all, it was a nice shopping experience with very pleasant employees but the prices were much higher than I expected. 
The store was very neat and well lite but I was expecting lower prices.







New York and Company is the WORST company I have ever dealt with,  Eastridge mall in San Jose the worst store. After battling months of chronic fatigue that left me bed rodden, then a viral infection that lasted 2 months.  I was finally physically able to go and return items I had order January 6, 2016. They refused to put the credit back on my card and only offered store credit.  When I ask if they could call customer service for me they said they can't call but they would give me a number to call. Of course the number was bogus and didn't allow you to speak with anyone.  I looked on the back of my platinum card and called customer service.  The person I talked with JENNY on4/4/16 said I could have the merchandise recredited to my account and she would speak with whomever was helping me, I put it on speaker and she told the girl to refill me and she would stay on the line and walk her through whatever steps so it would go through.  Then she told the sales girl she could give me a merchandise credit! The whole reason why I called platinum customer service was because I wanted it recredited to my account.  If this is how New York and Company treats people that are disabled they shouldn't be in business!  What's worse I have been shopping thete over 30 years.  Macy's is a must have better bet for customer service and appreciation. DO NOT SHOP THERE!

They refused to put the credit back on my card and only offered store credit.  When I ask if they could call customer service for me they said they can't call but they would give me a number to call. Of course the number was bogus and didn't allow you to speak with anyone.  I looked on the back of my platinum card and called customer service.  The person I talked with JENNY on4/4/16 said I could have the merchandise recredited to my account and she would speak with whomever was helping me, I put it on speaker and she told the girl to refill me and she would stay on the line and walk her through whatever steps so it would go through.  Then she told the sales girl she could give me a merchandise credit! The whole reason why I called platinum customer service was because I wanted it recredited to my account.  If this is how New York and Company treats people that are disabled they shouldn't be in business!  What's worse I have been shopping thete over 30 years.  Macy's is a must have better bet for customer service and appreciation. DO NOT SHOP THERE!

Now that I'm all grown up, my standards have changed. I used to be content with cheap, trendy, and easily disposable items. After all, I could load up on tons of stuff, and who doesn't love a deal? What I didn't realize is that I was throwing money away! Times have changed, and I've grown to value quality over quantity. I love the quality of the clothes from New York & Co! My only gripe is that I am between sizes on the jackets, but I have this issue everywhere. Finding a fabulous tailor is next on my to do list.

The sales associates at the Eastridge location are super friendly, helpful, and honest. The girls have helped me get the most value out of my purchases on numerous occasions, which has caused me to spend a little more than I usually would. The coupons are fabulous! Be sure to shop the buy 1, get 1 50% off sales, and bring those coupons for even deeper discounts! $50 off of a $100 purchase, and the $100 off of a $200 are examples of the type of savings I'm taking about. Sign up online to receive coupons and notifications of sales.

You're welcome.







HIGHLIGHTS: affordable styles

My shopping experience here started out good, but turned sour. I liked the fact that I was able to get a couple of shirts at an affordable price but at checkout the girl was super pushy and asked me 3 times (after I'd told her "no thank you" each time) if I wanted to apply for their damn credit card. How many different ways can I politely say NO. I won't be returning to this store. I didn't catch her name, but her cashier ID is 338735. Be aware of the pushy sales associate!







I usually don't leave review unless I really feel like it's necessary. For a place that I usually shop at and had good services, this time it was poorly given, especially by the store manager name Daisy/Deisy. 

I know holidays are really hectic and busy. Regardless of it, that doesn't mean you service your customers poorly. I went shopping here on 12/21, main reason was to make a return, but I ended up shopping. I switched my purse and wallet out few days ago and left my NYC credit card in my other wallet. My mom and I ended up doing some shopping here and since I had the $20 reward, which required me to use my NYC credit card. the line was long with only one register available. I patiently waited for a good amount of 20-30 mins. By the time it was my turn, Daisy/Deisy had the biggest face ever without a smile! Hey! I know you were probably tired and drained from the customers, but the customers are also tired and drained from a long day at work and having to go to the mall for last minute presents and waiting in line. Everyone is tired, I don't think you should give a big cranky face at the customers. I asked her if she can look up my account since I don't have my card on me. She called my account and loudly asked me to give her my last 4 digits of my social and repeated it loudly on the phone where other customers heard it. She wasn't happy making the call and at the end she told this store will No LONGER look up account for security purpose and if I want to shop here I would need my card. I know that many stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, JCPenney, and even Target would gladly call to look up for your account. Even at the other Ny&c in Oakridge Mall. Most stores even ask you to write your last 4 digits down on paper for security purpose instead of repeating it loudly along with my numbers. I asked her since when was this implemented and she said "now,"  with a big attitude tone to it. I asked her what's your name and she said "Daisy, I'm the store manager." Definitely a store manager with a big attitude. Regardless you are a store manager or a sales associate, that doesn't mean you give poor customer service and my purchase was over $130. There wasn't a smile on her face throughout the whole purchase, which I honestly think it matters for customer service. I waited for a long time in line and she looked mad. I don't care if you are store manager, but if you are then you need to ensure customers satisfactory and the store runs well for the holidays. I never had this experience before and I had also enjoyed shopping here!! Horrible experience ever! Especially coming from a store manager who doesn't understand what customer service is.







I bought a pair of pants here during their 50% off sale shortly after Thanksgiving weekend.  The jeans were "originally $60."  My ass, they were not that great of quality, but $30 was decent because they fit well.  When I brought them home and tried them on again, I realized they had a real chemical smell that made me nauseous.  I tried to wash them, but they still smelled!  On the third wash the color was completely faded and they STILL SMELLED.  I even washed them with vinegar.  Yeah, $60 my ass.

Also the girl at the counter was SOOOOOO rude. I can't even believe it.  I almost left the pants at the counter.  It should have been a sign to leave the pants there.  She wanted me to sign up for a credit card or something and I declined and she pushed again and I declined.  After that she asked me to donate to some charity and when I declined she pushed again.  I declined again and SHE PUSHED.  Who does that?  She got me to round up my purchase and donate a few measly cents to this charity.  She seriously ticked me off.  I am never going to this store again.







Worst NY&C ever! Worst customer service in store and their platinum service on the phone.  Especially the customer service representative JENNY I spoke with 4/4/16 from the Eastridge store. Of course this was after I had to use my own phone to call because the manager on duty said they don't call customer service for their customers she then preceeded to give me a bogus number that didn't allow you to speak to anyone in customer service,  just directed you to their website.  I had to look on the back of my platinum card to find a number where you can speak with a horrible, distespectful representative. This company treats people with disabilities like they are trash. They could truly care less. I have been a customer for over 30 years.  But I will never shop with them again.  They have lost my business forever!  I highly recommend shopping at Macy's,  they have excellent customer service and always have good deals.  They actually listen and try to assist their customers.  My best recommendation NEVER shop at a  New York and Company store or their website. This was the first day I was actually physically able to shop, they made what should have been a super happy day for me a stressful,  depressing shopping experience.







The service here is C grade.   I can't say much about their entire clothing line
because I have not bought much from them.  However, I was very disappointed with the supposedly leather belt that I bought from this store.  When I pointed out a couple of scratches on the belt to the clerk at the checkout counter, she looked at me straight in the eyes and adamantly said that they a natural thing for leather products.  To my amazement, the belt broke into two pieces two weeks after purchase.  I demand to know  from New York Company the source of manufacturing and a refund.







I get that they have long pants and jeans but what about the short and the skinny???

I can't fit their xsmall here. Its too bad. They have so many cute clothes especially for work/career. They have suits and comfy casuals. Great accessories as well. Definitely for the "adult" in you. I just wished I fit their clothing. 

I will continue looking and dressing like a 15 year old.







3.5 stars.

New York & Co. is where I shop to find work clothes :) They have a great selection on business and casual attires and in the end, it all comes out to a very affordable amount. I say "in the end" because they always have deals where they take certain percentages off a certain amount purchased.

For example, my mom and I shopped here last week. bought like 3 items and 2 pairs of socks and it already came out to a little over $100! Pretty pricey for me... but I got a discount because I pulled up my email from NY&Co giving me $40 off any purchase over $90... woohoo! My mom was able to get the same discount on her clothes, too.

Even if you don't shop here very often (or even at all) and you're not interested in signing up for an account (which gives you even more discounts/savings), it's totally ok - they ALWAYS have some kind of deal going on right in the store. No coupons, necessary.

It was already a 9:20 PM (20 minutes after they've already closed) when we finished our purchase and the lady helping us was super nice and patient! Thank you to her!... and thank you to the other associate who played Glee songs when the store was about to close - I'll admit, I started head bobbing, singing, and grooving a little while I was in the fitting room!







As a girl who stands 5'10" and is not quite as round as she is long, it can be a real challenge for me to find pants that will fit me properly. They are always either too baggy a hips or too dern short, but not at New York & Company. This has been my go to place for jeans and other assorted pants for quite a few years now for a variety of reasons. One, because their tall pants are the perfect height and make me happy =P. Two, because they have several different cuts and washes of jeans that are all great on me. And three, because they have incredible sales! 

And by incredible I mean incredible, this weekend I meandered into the store and saw that they were having a pant sale for 4.99. Jeans for $11 and kakhi pants for 4.99! And these are not the cheaply made pants that are going to wear out on you by the 3rd wash. So you can be sure that I stocked up on all my pant needs this weekend =)

So why only 3 stars? Because I really don't use this store for anything other than their good deals on pants.







I shop here for one thing and one thing only: LONG pants and jeans.

Sure, it's great being tall. At 5'11, I can reach things off of high shelves without help, see over people at concerts, go without heels, etc.

There is one MAJOR drawback though, and it's that I can hardly ever find pants that are long enough! If I buy regular pants, they end up looking like clam-diggers, and I end up looking like a nerd. Basically, I need at least a 34" inseam, which is hard to come by in women's clothing.  

NY & Co. has a decent selection (about 4 or 5 styles) of pants that fit me, so even if I can't stand the rest of the stuff in the store, I can walk in and be comforted in knowing that I can walk out in a decent pair of jeans, ankles unexposed to the world.







I live north of downtown and usually shop at Valley Fair or Oakridge.  Today I wanted to shop at 3 stores in particular and VF is the only other mall in the area that has all 3.  I was not about to hit up VF on a Saturday afternoon so I went on a little adventure to the east side!  

Yay! This location is great!  

The store was in great shape for a Saturday afternoon.  Even the clearance section was nicely organized!  I tried on a few things and a friendly sales girl helped me find additional sizes and even called around to other stores for me - I'll while being super sweet about it.  

If I need to shop at NY&Co I'll come to this location before hitting up Oakridge for VF.







RUDE, RUDE AND RUDE.  Everytime I go to this store, no one is greeting the customers and there are at least three workers standing around doing nothing.  Maybe rearranging the jewelry.  They are no help.  You have to ask them for help and they just give a look like "what"?  I shop at  Ann Taylor Loft.  Way nicer clothes and priced around the same.  Don't bother with this store unless you don't want help.







I love this store! They have really cute accessories, and nice professional, but stylish, work clothes. The staff is always very helpful and friendly.

Now that I'm all grown up, my standards have changed. I used to be content with cheap, trendy, and easily disposable items. After all, I could load up on tons of stuff, and who doesn't love a deal? What I didn't realize is that I was throwing money away! Times have changed, and I've grown to value quality over quantity. I love the quality of the clothes from New York & Co! My only gripe is that I am between sizes on the jackets, but I have this issue everywhere. Finding a fabulous tailor is next on my to do list.The sales associates at the Eastridge location are super friendly, helpful, and honest. The girls have helped me get the most value out of my purchases on numerous occasions, which has caused me to spend a little more than I usually would. The coupons are fabulous! Be sure to shop the buy 1, get 1 50% off sales, and bring those coupons for even deeper discounts! $50 off of a $100 purchase, and the $100 off of a $200 are examples of the type of savings I'm taking about. Sign up online to receive coupons and notifications of sales.You're welcome.

As a girl who stands 5'10" and is not quite as round as she is long, it can be a real challenge for me to find pants that will fit me properly. They are always either too baggy a hips or too dern short, but not at New York & Company. This has been my go to place for jeans and other assorted pants for quite a few years now for a variety of reasons. One, because their tall pants are the perfect height and make me happy =P. Two, because they have several different cuts and washes of jeans that are all great on me. And three, because they have incredible sales! And by incredible I mean incredible, this weekend I meandered into the store and saw that they were having a pant sale for 4.99. Jeans for $11 and kakhi pants for 4.99! And these are not the cheaply made pants that are going to wear out on you by the 3rd wash. So you can be sure that I stocked up on all my pant needs this weekend =)So why only 3 stars? Because I really don't use this store for anything other than their good deals on pants.

I shop here for one thing and one thing only: LONG pants and jeans.Sure, it's great being tall. At 5'11, I can reach things off of high shelves without help, see over people at concerts, go without heels, etc.There is one MAJOR drawback though, and it's that I can hardly ever find pants that are long enough! If I buy regular pants, they end up looking like clam-diggers, and I end up looking like a nerd. Basically, I need at least a 34" inseam, which is hard to come by in women's clothing.  NY & Co. has a decent selection (about 4 or 5 styles) of pants that fit me, so even if I can't stand the rest of the stuff in the store, I can walk in and be comforted in knowing that I can walk out in a decent pair of jeans, ankles unexposed to the world.

I live north of downtown and usually shop at Valley Fair or Oakridge.  Today I wanted to shop at 3 stores in particular and VF is the only other mall in the area that has all 3.  I was not about to hit up VF on a Saturday afternoon so I went on a little adventure to the east side!  Yay! This location is great!  The store was in great shape for a Saturday afternoon.  Even the clearance section was nicely organized!  I tried on a few things and a friendly sales girl helped me find additional sizes and even called around to other stores for me - I'll while being super sweet about it.  If I need to shop at NY&Co I'll come to this location before hitting up Oakridge for VF.

RUDE, RUDE AND RUDE.  Everytime I go to this store, no one is greeting the customers and there are at least three workers standing around doing nothing.  Maybe rearranging the jewelry.  They are no help.  You have to ask them for help and they just give a look like "what"?  I shop at  Ann Taylor Loft.  Way nicer clothes and priced around the same.  Don't bother with this store unless you don't want help.

I love this store! They have really cute accessories, and nice professional, but stylish, work clothes. The staff is always very helpful and friendly.

This is definitely my go to store of choice of all of the locations near me. 

The store is always very well organized, lots of choices of sizes, and the staff is always extremely friendly & welcoming! You can always count on a team member being on the floor to offer assistance & offer a fitting room if needed. Line is moved quick at checkout. 

The only con I can say is, the fitting rooms can use a little sprucing up. They are clean, but missing a majority of the hooks to hang up your clothes or purse. Other than that, two thumbs up for sure!







NY & Co you might want to inform your new employees who chose to close the dressing rooms at 825 when the store is open to 9 that they are hurting your profits. After being a loyal weekly shopper for over 8 years tonight I took my business across the way to Banana Republic because your employee literally rolled her eyes and scrunched her nose when myself and another customer questioned why All dressing rooms were closed? In addition, BR employees apologized for your employees lack of service. That's how you grow your profits!







The Most pathetic brand and store, I have ever seen..... I order an item online, and but didn't like it because of improper fitting. I called the store and the "first lie" they told me, that I cannot return the product online and I have to come personally to store to return it. When I went to store they gave me store credit. The "second lie" they told me that I can gift that card to anyone if I don't want to use it, whereas that card strictly says "This card is a non-transferable card" and the "biggest lie" was they told me that I can use that card for online purchase. When I was trying to add that card to my account, I couldn't add it, because it can only be used in stores. "STOP ANNOYING PEOPLE, IF YOU GUYS DOESN'T HAVE KNOWLEDGE, THEN DON'T TALK BULLSHIT AND STOP LYING". 

I called and spoke with the store manager named "Victoria" and she said that she can do an exception of changing the store credit to a gift card, which I can use it online, let's see how much truth it is. Will keep you guys posted, in the meantime, please be aware of their stupid and pathetic policies and lies.







I love this store they always have great deals and quality clothes. I called the Pleasanton location this morning using the app on my phone looking for black sailor pants with the buttons on the front. I spoke to Victoria and I inquired about these pants she found them in my size along with a couple of sweaters that I was looking for. She told me she would put them on hold for me to pick up this afternoon. She also looked up a couple of other items I was looking for. They weren't a available, but it's cool since I can get these online. I came in as planned and Victoria had everything  ready that I wanted to purchase. I found a nice sweater for $7.00. The other lady Daysha who took over for Victoria to finish ringing me up noticed their was a red stain on it and immediately assisted me with picking a duplicate of this sweater without the stain. Great looking out because not everyone pays attention to detail when ringing up customer purchases. This sweater works well for me since I work in the city and you never know about the weather. Plus it will come in handy if the rain returns. Victoria and Daysha were very professional and helpful. I'm happy with my purchases.  I spent $48.15 saved $105.88 today. Woo who!







This is my go to store for work clothes. I'm probably here at least once a month and always get great service. The employees are friendly and helpful when I have a question or need to use the dressing rooms. The store is also usually super clean and organized. I also looooove all their sales. The only downfall is walking in and wearing the same clothes that are hanging on the rack. Talk about moded! Lol







It's been a while since I visited this location, but after walking in the store, I realized why. I was the first customer to enter once the employee rolled up the gate. As I entered, the staff looked me in my face and did not greet me or anything. I couldn't even get a good morning. Shortly after, another customer enters and words were exchanged by the same employee. I assume this customer was greeted. At that moment, I wanted to walk out of the store. Unfortunately, this is the only place of business that has the clothing I need to purchase at this mall. I grabbed some clothes to try on and approached another employee, Brianna, for her assistance. She was very helpful and friendly. She assisted me in picking out the proper size of clothing with no hesitation. Now that it's time to pay the bill, there's the initial employee at the register, now wanting to have a conversation. I really did not feel like speaking to her at this point. She rang up my purchase, which totaled almost $160. On my way out, I stopped Brianna and told her that she was the reason why I chose not to walk out of the store. It was because of her that I didn't walk out and go to another mall. Please know that something like a greeting can go a long way.







I love this store because of their designs. I work at doctors office, so I always need to be dressed in semi-formal attire. Everything in this store (minus the athletic wear) I can definitely wear to work! 

Black Friday sales are good too on top of that they have sales literally from end of Nov to early Jan. 

Lots of differently sizes (petite, long, regular)  which is very nice, but its hard to find my size because I'm petite and everyone Asian girl in the Bay Area is too. :)







I'm writing in regards to the location in the Sun Valley mall. I am not crazy about going to the Sun Valley mall however they do have some nice shops in there.


I have been coming here for years, there clothes are not top quality though quality enough and seem to last fairly long.

This particular store always seems to have a great selection of sharp, modern style chic clothes all the way from casual nice, sharp looking work wear clothes and a descent selection of going out clothes and best of all they have a petite section.

Store is bright and clean. Good service are a hit and miss here like any department store. Today service was especially helpful. There is Limited amount of Fitting rooms  though they are bright and large with GOOD LIGHTING a +...lol they have a descent selection of nice sharp new edge jewelry (don't last particular long being a little cheap) shoes look a little on the cheaper side. As for everything else is stylish comfortable and seems to last pretty long depending how you care for  it.

Prices can be a little expensive however they are always having a lot of great sales.







Have never been disappointed from the collection they have, have never walked out empty handed.







I used to work here. My whole side of the women in the family shop here. It used to be a good experience everytime I walk in there, but I think that EVERYBODY should work as one and everything should be divided evenly in work. The clothes have a more younger look, but it is nice. Plus there is ALWAYS sales! :) Overall, everything is usually good for a customer shopping experience with the right employees. I would recommend NYC







I have to give 2 stars because it's very clean and organized inside.  However, they need to restock their sizes frequently.







I'm a loyal customer and have been shopping there for years (in the serramonte one though).  I only go there twice a year, June and December, when the sales are a score!!!  I don't go otherwise.  I used to work here when it was called Lerner NY and in most cases that's what i still call it.  

They have my size.  Petites, average and tall can shop here.  

It's just the current set up nowadays can be hard for the eyes.  They don't shelve their pants any more in descending order according to size and shape like they used to.  I haven't seen any jackets there either, which they had a whole section of when i worked there.







So...I've never really shopped here before, always just looked in the window. But my friend had a return so I mosey on in and of course found something to buy when I wasn't going to buy anything! A way cute raincoat that was black and white plaid AND is was 30% OFF! So how could I resist? It will be perfect for those surprise rain showers when I go to NYC in a few weeks and I'll definitely be stylin' now. And then a belt and a purse for 50% off so cute! And the girl behind the counter was really helpful and got me signed up for free coupons (so I'll come back and spend more money of course!) All in all the service was good and the sales girls very friendly and helpful. Some great sales and cute cute stuff....oh yeah I'll be back!







The Music at the store is too loud every time I go in. It makes for a frustrating  shopping experience. I feel like I can not hear myself think. I also think the  aisles are to small for  a stroller. I know that not everyp erson in the world has to shop with a stroller but I do and I wish the walkways were less hard to get threw. 

The sale racks int he back possibly clearance area is STUFFED with stuff. It make the shop look messy when you head back to the back of the store. There is nothing worse than a messy shop. It makes me feel frantic when I am shopping.

There are good deals to be had  when you shop there but it seems like I am struggling to find reason to go back anytime soon.







I have been coming to this place since high school every time i need a nice work shirt. So i have been in this store 3 times this month. The first two, i bought 1 shirt each time-- same style, different color, 40 dollars each. I bought the second one because i decided i didn't like the first one's color on me, but i didn't have it at the time to return. I came back the third time, coming out from san francisco where i live (i grew up in pleasanton, that's why i was out here the first two times) specifically to return this shirt with my receipt, even giving my boyfriend money for gas to drive me out here. 

I go in, tell the sales associate "i bought two of the same shirts, but decided i didn't like this color" and she scans my receipt and said "this shirt is not on this receipt." Shit, i grabbed the receipt for the second shirt! I explain politely that i live in san francisco and i grabbed the wrong receipt, could she just do the refund for this one.  She said no, offered me a 22 dollar refund instead and i said "fine, i am not coming out here from san francisco again" when the manager told me that there is one in san francisco. How could i have not known?! I looked for one on yelp and their website, there is one in san francisco? No... there is one in daly city. The sales associate had the nerve to tell me it would probably be easier to get to that one from where i live then to the pleasanton one. Bitch, what? This is what i said, "what am i gonna do, walk from the nearest SF bus stop to get to the daly city one?" Anybody who has lived for any amount of time in SF or Daly city knows how separate they are.

So i took by 22 dollar refund. Oh wait, no i didn't, they forgot to mention i only get store credit. Does anybody want it? Because i don't. Seriously, screw this place. 

Same shirt, different color. Thanks for giving me a good fuck, NY&C. Btw i bought the shirt for a job interview because i have been out of work since making the move to SF, buying these shirts put my bank account into double digits. Luckily i got the job... i get paid for the first time in 3 weeks, maybe i can use my store credit to buy food until then!!!







The clothes are v. inexpensive, and quite a few are cheaply made.  However, they have great sales (like everything is 50% off), so if you see something you like, don't you DARE pay full price.

When I went here, the customer service left much to be desired- we waited over 10 minutes in line (we were 4th from the register).

Bottom line: worth picking through; be prepared to wait if your'e shopping on a weekday afternoon.







Wow I'm so glad I decided to walk in this place today!  I was on my way to forever 21, as I usually walk right past this place because for some reason I thought it was for the more mature crowd.  hehe.  But I was also looking for something more professional today and decided to see what they have to offer.  They had a great sale going on and I think almost everything's on sale, like 50%!!!  The signs said selected styles, and at first I thought, oh another scam, just a few items are really 50%...  But I saw a shirt I really liked and it had no markings on it that it was on sale.  When I asked the register lady, which was super nice by the way, she said yup it's only 15!.  And the jewelry was only 5 bucks down from 30! That was selected styles, but others were 50% off.  I was really happy, and let's just say that this store unexpedtedly took up an hour of my 1.5 hour slot dedicated to forever 21!  If you want Express like clothes, but less workish and more daytime, AND  more affordable with a great staff, then come in here.  
Whoo hoo- got a pair of earrings, 2 neckalaces, a cuute belt, a nice button shirt, and a long white tunic for 50 bucks!

This is definitely my go to store of choice of all of the locations near me. The store is always very well organized, lots of choices of sizes, and the staff is always extremely friendly & welcoming! You can always count on a team member being on the floor to offer assistance & offer a fitting room if needed. Line is moved quick at checkout. The only con I can say is, the fitting rooms can use a little sprucing up. They are clean, but missing a majority of the hooks to hang up your clothes or purse. Other than that, two thumbs up for sure!

NY & Co you might want to inform your new employees who chose to close the dressing rooms at 825 when the store is open to 9 that they are hurting your profits. After being a loyal weekly shopper for over 8 years tonight I took my business across the way to Banana Republic because your employee literally rolled her eyes and scrunched her nose when myself and another customer questioned why All dressing rooms were closed? In addition, BR employees apologized for your employees lack of service. That's how you grow your profits!

The Most pathetic brand and store, I have ever seen..... I order an item online, and but didn't like it because of improper fitting. I called the store and the "first lie" they told me, that I cannot return the product online and I have to come personally to store to return it. When I went to store they gave me store credit. The "second lie" they told me that I can gift that card to anyone if I don't want to use it, whereas that card strictly says "This card is a non-transferable card" and the "biggest lie" was they told me that I can use that card for online purchase. When I was trying to add that card to my account, I couldn't add it, because it can only be used in stores. "STOP ANNOYING PEOPLE, IF YOU GUYS DOESN'T HAVE KNOWLEDGE, THEN DON'T TALK BULLSHIT AND STOP LYING". I called and spoke with the store manager named "Victoria" and she said that she can do an exception of changing the store credit to a gift card, which I can use it online, let's see how much truth it is. Will keep you guys posted, in the meantime, please be aware of their stupid and pathetic policies and lies.

I used to work here. My whole side of the women in the family shop here. It used to be a good experience everytime I walk in there, but I think that EVERYBODY should work as one and everything should be divided evenly in work. The clothes have a more younger look, but it is nice. Plus there is ALWAYS sales! :) Overall, everything is usually good for a customer shopping experience with the right employees. I would recommend NYC

I have to give 2 stars because it's very clean and organized inside.  However, they need to restock their sizes frequently.

I'm a loyal customer and have been shopping there for years (in the serramonte one though).  I only go there twice a year, June and December, when the sales are a score!!!  I don't go otherwise.  I used to work here when it was called Lerner NY and in most cases that's what i still call it.  They have my size.  Petites, average and tall can shop here.  It's just the current set up nowadays can be hard for the eyes.  They don't shelve their pants any more in descending order according to size and shape like they used to.  I haven't seen any jackets there either, which they had a whole section of when i worked there.

So...I've never really shopped here before, always just looked in the window. But my friend had a return so I mosey on in and of course found something to buy when I wasn't going to buy anything! A way cute raincoat that was black and white plaid AND is was 30% OFF! So how could I resist? It will be perfect for those surprise rain showers when I go to NYC in a few weeks and I'll definitely be stylin' now. And then a belt and a purse for 50% off so cute! And the girl behind the counter was really helpful and got me signed up for free coupons (so I'll come back and spend more money of course!) All in all the service was good and the sales girls very friendly and helpful. Some great sales and cute cute stuff....oh yeah I'll be back!

The Music at the store is too loud every time I go in. It makes for a frustrating  shopping experience. I feel like I can not hear myself think. I also think the  aisles are to small for  a stroller. I know that not everyp erson in the world has to shop with a stroller but I do and I wish the walkways were less hard to get threw. The sale racks int he back possibly clearance area is STUFFED with stuff. It make the shop look messy when you head back to the back of the store. There is nothing worse than a messy shop. It makes me feel frantic when I am shopping.There are good deals to be had  when you shop there but it seems like I am struggling to find reason to go back anytime soon.

I have been coming to this place since high school every time i need a nice work shirt. So i have been in this store 3 times this month. The first two, i bought 1 shirt each time-- same style, different color, 40 dollars each. I bought the second one because i decided i didn't like the first one's color on me, but i didn't have it at the time to return. I came back the third time, coming out from san francisco where i live (i grew up in pleasanton, that's why i was out here the first two times) specifically to return this shirt with my receipt, even giving my boyfriend money for gas to drive me out here. I go in, tell the sales associate "i bought two of the same shirts, but decided i didn't like this color" and she scans my receipt and said "this shirt is not on this receipt." Shit, i grabbed the receipt for the second shirt! I explain politely that i live in san francisco and i grabbed the wrong receipt, could she just do the refund for this one.  She said no, offered me a 22 dollar refund instead and i said "fine, i am not coming out here from san francisco again" when the manager told me that there is one in san francisco. How could i have not known?! I looked for one on yelp and their website, there is one in san francisco? No... there is one in daly city. The sales associate had the nerve to tell me it would probably be easier to get to that one from where i live then to the pleasanton one. Bitch, what? This is what i said, "what am i gonna do, walk from the nearest SF bus stop to get to the daly city one?" Anybody who has lived for any amount of time in SF or Daly city knows how separate they are.So i took by 22 dollar refund. Oh wait, no i didn't, they forgot to mention i only get store credit. Does anybody want it? Because i don't. Seriously, screw this place. Same shirt, different color. Thanks for giving me a good fuck, NY&C. Btw i bought the shirt for a job interview because i have been out of work since making the move to SF, buying these shirts put my bank account into double digits. Luckily i got the job... i get paid for the first time in 3 weeks, maybe i can use my store credit to buy food until then!!!

The clothes are v. inexpensive, and quite a few are cheaply made.  However, they have great sales (like everything is 50% off), so if you see something you like, don't you DARE pay full price.When I went here, the customer service left much to be desired- we waited over 10 minutes in line (we were 4th from the register).Bottom line: worth picking through; be prepared to wait if your'e shopping on a weekday afternoon.

Wow I'm so glad I decided to walk in this place today!  I was on my way to forever 21, as I usually walk right past this place because for some reason I thought it was for the more mature crowd.  hehe.  But I was also looking for something more professional today and decided to see what they have to offer.  They had a great sale going on and I think almost everything's on sale, like 50%!!!  The signs said selected styles, and at first I thought, oh another scam, just a few items are really 50%...  But I saw a shirt I really liked and it had no markings on it that it was on sale.  When I asked the register lady, which was super nice by the way, she said yup it's only 15!.  And the jewelry was only 5 bucks down from 30! That was selected styles, but others were 50% off.  I was really happy, and let's just say that this store unexpedtedly took up an hour of my 1.5 hour slot dedicated to forever 21!  If you want Express like clothes, but less workish and more daytime, AND  more affordable with a great staff, then come in here.  Whoo hoo- got a pair of earrings, 2 neckalaces, a cuute belt, a nice button shirt, and a long white tunic for 50 bucks!

Fast FactsFDA advises consumers to discard any soup products from Island Soups Company, Inc. of New York with Best Before dates between July 2015 and June 2018 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that causes botulism.FDA is working with Island Soups Company to ensure that recalled product is removed from the market. FDA’s safety concerns extend to all low-acid canned food products with Best Before dates between July 2015 and June 2018.What is the problem and what is being done about it?FDA inspected Island Soups Company, Inc. on June 22, 2016 and determined the facility does not meet mandatory safety requirements for thermally processed low-acid canned food (LACF) products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA’s review of the facility revealed significant violations of requirements relating to, among other things, documentation of processes, equipment, and recordkeeping in the production of the company's LACF products. Failure to adhere to mandatory safety requirements can result in under-processed foods, which can allow the survival and growth of Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum), a bacterium that causes botulism. After a July 2015 FDA inspection, Island Soups Company signed an affidavit stating it would cease production and distribution until it met FDA regulatory requirements, including filing its scheduled processes for its thermally-processed LACF products. To date, Island Soups Company has not filed scheduled processes for these products. Despite the signed 2015 affidavit, the company continued to distribute soups to online customers in March and June of 2016. The online distribution of the soups triggered the follow-up inspection on June 22, 2016.On August 30, 2016, the FDA issued an order requiring Island Soups Company to obtain a written “emergency permit” from the Agency. An emergency permit may be required whenever the FDA finds, after investigation, that a commercial processor has failed to fulfill all the requirements pertaining to LACF products, including registration and the filing of process information. An emergency permit would be issued only after the Agency has verified that the company has met the FDA’s regulatory requirements in such a way that the company’s products can be considered safe and can be distributed into interstate commerce.After a conversation with the FDA, Island Soups Company ordered a recall of six varieties of Island Soups brand products on September 7, 2016 because they have the potential to be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum.What specific products are recalled?FDA will continue to update this list if additional products are recalled.GUNGO PEAS SOUP, NET WT. 16OZGUNGO PEAS SOUP NO MEAT, NET WT. 16OZRED PEAS SOUP, NET WT. 16OZRED PEAS SOUP NO MEAT, NET WT. 16OZMANNISH WATER, NET WT. 16OZFISH SOUP, NET WT. 16OZ All products coded BEST BEFORE dates July 2015 through June 2018.Consumer AdviceConsumers should discard any of the identified LACF products from Island Soups Company, Inc. with Best Before dates between July 2015 and June 2018 because they were not manufactured, processed, or packaged in accordance with mandatory safety requirements for thermally processed low-acid canned food (LACF) products and therefore have the potential to be contaminated with Clostridium botulinum.Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.If you are unsure of your risk, ask your healthcare provider.

Having more than 20 years of experience, Chip Botjer and Steve Wilkenshoff established Best Products Sales & Service, Inc. in 1998 to be the premier sales and service provider of money processing equipment, ATM’s, as well as transaction processing services throughout the tri-state area. Best Products Sales & Service, Inc. has grown to be one of the largest and most respected leaders of the industry. After growing too large for our office, we relocated to a larger office and warehouse located right around the corner, still in Floral Park and tripling our space to better serve our customers. Our continued success is built on our promise to provide the very best equipment while supporting all of our products with a full time team of experienced factory trained service technicians. We represent all the major brands including Tranax, Triton, Tidel, Billcon, Scan Coin, Cashscan, DeLaRue, Maverick, Magner, JCM, Rowe, Laurel, Toyocom and many more. Recently, we have added credit card processing also known as merchant services to our long list of services.

Support
Anyone can sell you an ATM or place an ATM Machine in your business, but it's what happens after the sale that matters most and keeping your equipment 100% operational is our #1 priority. Service is what distinguishes Best from the rest... From our own in house full time team of experienced factory trained service technicians, to our friendly and knowledgeable in house customer support staff, only Best Products has the experience and resources to get your machine up and running and keep it that way. Best Products bring new technology and innovation to the forefront with our unique service software platform. This software platform allows us to schedule and prevent service issues before they arise. Our unique software tracks and manages service history, efficiently routes and deploys service technicians, as well as schedules preventative maintenance visits. The software also gives us the ability to compile a detailed service history profile so we can more effectively manage every aspect of your individual ATM or a complete ATM portfolio. Keeping a more traditional approach, we have a full warehouse of in stock parts for all of the machines we sell and our technicians stock the most common parts with them at all times so they have parts readily available to keep you up and running. We take pride in our 4 hour average service call response time. In fact 99% of all service calls are closed the same day they are placed! Our software, experienced personnel coupled with our huge parts arsenal gives us a huge competitive advantage in the industry. Best Products handles all aspects of ATM repair including first line maintenance, second line maintenance, ATM installation, ATM setups, ATM rigging, ATM parts repair, and ATM parts sales. So why settle for anything less than Best?

This dress has style and an essence that makes it hard to miss, in my opinion it would be a perfect dress to wear to work because you will be feeling as good as you look. New York & Company is running a sale on dresses right now and they have this one marked at 60% off which is a heck of a deal and is an online exclusive. I tried to find this listing elsewhere and came up empty handed, so better buy them up quick!

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

            Listed in Born to Shop


I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

            Listed in Born to Shop


I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

            Listed in Born to Shop


I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 

1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 
2. The styles are great 
3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 
4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 
5. The customer service isn't all that great... 
6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 
7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... 

Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......







Horrible, horrible customer service!
Came in to do a return and I had my receipt the African American lady gave me such a hard time! Honestly I felt discriminated! But it's every time I come to this New York &a company! I really miss the Hayward one! I would not shop here!







Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.







I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.

This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.

NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.







Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!







I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!







Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"

  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!







Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:

Good: 
1. Selection of clothing and styles
2. Certain outfits better than Express
3. High quality material used
4. Well-organized

Bad: 
1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).

There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. 

BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.







I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. 

Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!
PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1







I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.
They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.







I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.







I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.







I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. 

I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. 

When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. 

That was irritating. 

I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. 

I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. 

Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. 

Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.

Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.







I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.







Hazel at the store was very helpful. She helped me pick up the right clothes for my close friends and my mom. Ask for Hazel. She's awesome!.







The ladies that work here are great! Very friendly & helpful. I love the options of clothes they have and they fit great







I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. 

I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. 
I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.







Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:

Good:
- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too
-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions 
-Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!

Not so good:
- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.
- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them







***March 13, 2008 Update***
It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!

...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.

***Original May 22, 2007 Review***
New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.

Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.

This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.

The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.

Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?







Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.

Here are the reasons why I'm giving this place 3 stars: 1. The store is organized and stocked with merchandise 2. The styles are great 3. They have Petite and Tall sizes 4. The prices are affordable when it's on clearance 5. The customer service isn't all that great... 6. It's hard to find help, when you need it...... 7. The fittings rooms aren't that clean (floor)..... Overall, I prefer to shop at Express than here.......

Terrible customer service. Every time I go there's an employee who always chews gum (very unprofessional) and she's very unfriendly. I went to return a few items and it seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. One time I also found a skirt in the clearance and it was marked red and the same employee didn't want to give me the sale price and she was just rude about it. I try my best not to go to this New York and company, it's a bummer there's not another one closer to me.

I hate malls and I hate shopping for a purpose. But I love shopping online and then returning in stores for free. I love New York and Company for some odd reason, the price and quality is there. They have really great deals if you catch them.This store in NewPark Mall is convenient for me to get to for my returns. One thing about it was when I did my previous return the person at the store asked why I was returning. I said well wrong size. She's like well if you shopped in person, you'd always get the right size. I'm like...right. I just shrugged and went on my merry way.NewPark Mall was my old mall when I grew up. It's pretty much old and run down now, but still is good for its purpose.

Went to new park mall New York & Company store during my lunch to purchase some dresses. Arrived the doors were closed & locked-:(:( Sale clerk approach & said there system has been down since this morning will be back up later. After I walked over to Macy's to check out there dresses but I wasn't feeling on what was in stock: within the 30 minutes passing I called over to New York & Company and a female salesperson said there is still down then hold on wait/ as she talk to another employee well it up then she replied give us another 30 mins to re-open. The way her conversation was going it did not feel she was tell the true. Before you decide to go & shop perhaps people should call so they wouldn't have to be turned away!!

I'm giving them 2 stars only because they have really nice clothes for work, however the restrictions on their coupons are insane. I went to the clearance section picked out a few items o liked tried them on and figured I'd take them since they were on red line marked down 70% off. I almost never pay full price for items here unless I really love the piece. So anyway I went to pay and asked her to ring up and check what the final prices on the items were, since they were on sale. She checked the prices and turned out they were only buy one get one half off bringing my total to $108 not including taxes! Mind you this was 1 shirt and 2 slacks, the cashier said they must have been miss racked that the price was correct but the sales rack they were on wasnt. Psh....I left the clothes there and said no thank you. Maybe I'll be back when the stockers learn how to do their jobs correctly and rack appropriately!

Horrible customer service! I only buy clothes from New York and company. Lost the receipt for my city bucks (too many stack together- staple fell off). I showed my account statement verifying my purchase on the New York and company credit card. The supervisors response was "we can't do anything without a receipt"  What happened to good customer service and common sense?! I'll be shopping at the limited and express from now on!

Here are the reasons why I give this place two stars:Good: 1. Selection of clothing and styles2. Certain outfits better than Express3. High quality material used4. Well-organizedBad: 1. CUSTOMER SERVICE. See what a big difference it makes even though I listed more pros than cons.  The con is bad enough for me to not want to shop at this particular location (atleast).There was only one person working here that did not make me feel uncomfortable. The other two ladies (particularly one of them) looks like she is about to explode any minute out of anger. Meh. That's a big disappointment. I thought it was geared only towards me because one time I came here on a week night to exchange a pair of clothing. However, I went there again today and she was giving the same horrendous attitude to another customer in line. Ridiculous. BEWARE. I don't know her name, and even if i did, I don't intend to exploit an employee. Just making it clear that certain employees need to be swapped if this store at all wants returning customers.

I had such a worst experience here. Last week i returned 15 products and none of my returns got processed. When i called the store manager and asked them about return, they told me that it has been processed from their end to my paypal acount.  I did not receive a refund for 10 days after which i had to call both Paypal and NYC company 3 times each after which they figured out that the sales associate did a mistake in processing my return....grrrr. Such inefficient employees work at this location. I will never ever go to this store again. Even if i do i will make sure 10 times that they do their job well. Another time when i returned few dresses there, associate who works at this location forgot to provide me refund for one of the item but kept the product at the store. How crazy is that...I spent 1 week figuring out what went wrong with my bills that i am missing 300 bucks. This Store SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU GO AND PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY DO THE JOB WELL AS THEY SUCK BADLY!!1

I went to the store yesterday evening to buy some of the dresses and they didn't have most of the dresses. When I asked the store keeper about the dresses he responded rudely and said this is all we carry if you need anything else order online (as if I didn't know I could order online). Well I asked this lady at the store for a belt size in small she says there are so many belts in the store and I don't know if there is a small size. I expect the store keepers to at least help me to find it and don't expect a rude response.They have moved the store to the 1st level and it looks good but the customer service is terrible and will never enter the store if I see the same guy and lady. I may give it another try but If I have a same experience then this store is out of my list.

            Listed in Born to Shop


I got an online coupon for $50 off after spending $100 and I already had a gift card for $35 so i figured, I couldn't lose on this one.  Basically spend about $20 bucks out of pocket and get $100 worth in clothes.  I visited this NYC store and it was just sad.  Aside from the massive online coupons they sent out for Veterans day; they also had "cash rewards" sales... Their selection was very poor... they only had big  sizes on all pants and their sale merchandise was in complete disarray.  I managed to find a super cute raincoat and decided to try it out.  I didn't want to go into the fitting rooms and when I looked around for a mirror to try it out, i didn't see any!  No mirrors in a female clothing store!!! Are you SERIOUS?  They have more mirrors at Payless Shoes than they do at NYC???? I could not believe it.  I had to find a sales rep to ask her where the heck their mirrors where.  She pointed at two very slim mirrors on both sides of the store towards the fitting rooms.  I still needed to buy one more item because the raincoat was on sale and it didn't add up to the $100 so I decided to look at their skinny pants.  I saw some gray ones that were really nice and the smallest they had was a 2 but I needed a 0.  I looked in the black ones and found one but they were also discounted at buy one and get one for 50% off so i figured why not get the second pair.  When i asked a different sales rep if that's all the sizes they had on the gray ones and she said yes, she looked me up and down and said, "But we should have your size"  WTF does that mean!  If I asked her if that's all they had in sizes it is only fair to deduce that I DID NOT find the size I was looking for.  I just shook my head, grabbed a sweater instead and proceeded to pay my stuff.  People now a days are soooooo funny.  Just can't think outside the box.

I normally don't get greeted at the store but when an associate is nearby they are always courteous. I love your clothes and enjoy shopping in this store. It's unfortunate that the other yelpers did not have a good experience but personally I enjoy the store.

I highly recommend not ordering anything from this store to be shipped to your house. I had wanted a sweater in size small and it was unavailable in store, but it was available online. The clerk offered to order it for me and have it shipped for a nominal fee (under $3). I thought that sounded convenient and gave her all of my information. When I received the confirmation email a few days later, I realized that the woman forgot to put in my apartment number. I called the customer service right away and was told that there was nothing they could do, since the item already shipped. She advised that I wait until the item was returned to them, call them back, and place a new order. That was irritating. I hadn't heard anything in a couple of days and couldn't access any shipping information online, so I called Customer Service again. This lady told me that I should have called UPS originally and that the first customer service clerk had advised me incorrectly. She told me to call USPS (apparently UPS transfers the package to USPS) and find out what happened. She was unapologetic for the series of errors and the amount of time I've wasted at work with this issue. I called USPS and found out that the item is already being shipped back to the sender. So now I will have to call NY & Co Customer Service yet again. At this point, there is no guarantee the same sweater will even be available. Had I known that the clerk at this store was a stupid moron who couldn't enter an apartment number, I would have just ordered it online myself. Save yourself the trouble and go shop somewhere else.Edited to add: I just spent 30 mins on the phone with NY & Co Customer Service and found out that the sweater is sold out and that I can't get it. I am so sad about this. It was such a unique color and it doesn't sound like the sweater will come back in stock.

I am a loyal New York and Company customer, I buy most of my shirt and work pants in your company.  I have a charge account with you guys and through the years I am positive I have spent thousands of dollars.  I am a walking advertising for your clothes and accessories.  I am normally pretty happy with the service at the store, but I bought a blouse which I plan to wear for valentines day.  I paid almost $50 for the shirt.  As I am getting ready to go out I put my normal perfume and I noticed that the shirt was bleeding its colors.  (This has never happened before with any of your clothes) So I brought the shirt back and spoke to your store manager "Andee".  I explained to her what happen, as I never even got to wear the shirt.  She started to look at the shirt and proceeded to tell me how I had to be careful with my perfume and that I had stained the shirt with my lipstick, and that the shirt had other stains on it. Lets begin with the fact that I don't even wear lipstick.  Let me go on with the fact that most women wear perfume and their clothes do not bleed through.  And the fact that I never go to wear the shirt in the first place, how can you not take it back?  I am baffled.  I explained to her that I bough clothes all the time at the store, and she basically told me that she didn't care. I was pretty shocked, so I walked away and then when I came back and asked her what her name was, she just rolled her eyes and proceeded to write her name on a piece of paper.  Honestly I a seriously thinking if I should ever buy your clothes again, if this is the type of service that will be provided to me when there is a problem,   I am extremely disappointed.

I love shopping at the store but my online experience was not so favorable.  1st of all I was not able to use my coupon code for a lot of the things online. 2nd I received a confirmation for my ONLINE order and THAT'S IT!  I received an email that said I would receive my order in 5-7 days.  After 7 days past I went online to hunt for my order status.  When I attempted to check my order status it said the item was ordered THAT'S IT!  so, I had to call customer service and they advised me I had 1 item on backorder so that delayed my back whole order.  The lady on the phone was nice and apologetic and informed me that she released the rest of the order to be shipped.  I let her know that I was not happy that I had NO COMMUNICATION about the delay of my order or the fact that something was on back order.  The NYC online experience was not as good as JCP, Macy's or other online retail sites that send you lots of email concerning your order status. I could not find anything on YELP for their online shopping so that is why I am writing the review on the site. I like the store experience and hate the online experience.  Needless to say I will not shop online at NYC again.

Alrighty, I've got some good and bad with this place:Good:- I really like most of their styles, and they have a good range of them too-The prices are affordable and they are always offering specials/sales/and promotions -Their striped collared shirts are my fave...plus they have Tall size pants (and petite)...thank god!!!Not so good:- There's usually no employees located anywhere else in the store other than at the cash register.  If you have questions about merchandise or need a fitting room, take a number and get in line.- While their prices are very affordable, as the saying goes...you get what you pay for.  I don't mean the apparel falls apart or anything, but a lot of the pants wrinkle pretty bad just from sitting down once, and the shirts are the same, even if you heavily starch them

***March 13, 2008 Update***It pains me to do so...but I have to knock off a star.  I don't know what they're doing with their fashions...but it's got to stop!!!  The last 3 to 4 times I've been there I have found NOTHING that I wanted to buy.  NOTHING!  Please...the last thing anybody wants at the beginning of Spring is a black dress...so why do you have 4 different ones?!  Nobody is going to buy those!...and why is everything else white?!  Is white in fashion again?  When was all that white stuff in fashion?  I can't remember.***Original May 22, 2007 Review***New York & Company is supposedly the same as my all time favorite Lerner New York...but the last time I was at a Lerner NY it was still different.  Even though it's my favorite store, I walked in there prepared to give it a low rating because it's in ghetto mall and ghetto mall Gap is crap.Well, I just couldn't do it.  Yeah, in true ghetto mall fashion it has a little less selection than a normal NY&C...but it's really not bad.  The salespeople were really nice and helpful and I managed to find myself 2 tops, a skirt, and some jewelry.  Not bad for a Tuesday.This place reignited my love for NY&C so much that I almost bought a Coach knockoff purse that said NY NY NY all over it just to advertise for them.The corporation still hasn't gotten over that annoying habit of asking for your phone number every time you shop there though.  You'd think that class action lawsuit they lost would've done the trick...but apparently not.  Just say no when they ask.  It's all good.Did I mention I hate ghetto mall?

Customer service is horrible, when you call them they are so rude and never solve your problem. I can't believe how bad experience I had with them.
