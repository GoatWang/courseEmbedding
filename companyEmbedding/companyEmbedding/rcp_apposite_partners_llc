Product Models
Detailed Comparison



Linktropy WAN Emulators
Linktropy WAN emulators simulate a single link through each pair of interfaces, offering the simplest configuration possible. If you need to emulate a single set of conditions between two networks, Linktropy is the product for you.

Linktropy Models
Linktropy Mini2: Basic, low cost emulator up to 100 Mbps 	in a portable form factor
Linktropy Mini-G: Basic, low cost emulator up to 1 Gbps in a portable form factor
Linktropy 5510:  Lab-quality  emulator simulating a single WAN link up to 1 Gbps					  
Linktropy 8510:  Lab-quality  emulator simulating	four	separate	gigabit	speed	WAN links through four pairs of GigE ports


 
Netropy Advanced Network Emulators

Netropy advanced network emulators simulate  up to 15 separate WAN links, each with their own bandwidth, delay, and loss characteristics, through each pair of physical ports. Packets can be assigned to individual links by IP address range, VLAN, or any other packet specifier. 
Netropy also offers advanced emulation and administrative capabilities for complex requirements or multi-user environments.
The Netropy N61 model emulates links up to 1 Gbps while the N91 provides 4 x 1G capabilities at full line rate. The Netropy 10G1 simulates links up to 10 Gbps in an affordable, 1U system. The 10G2  doubles the capacity to simulate two separate 10 Gbps links through two pairs of SFP+ ports. The Netropy 40G emulates links up to 40 Gbps.  All models are available at a variety of maximum emulation speeds for users who do not need the full capacity of the device.
To model complex network topologies, run multiple concurrent tests, or emulate links of greater than 1 Gbps, select the Netropy network emulator.
Netropy Models
Netropy N61:  Emulate complex networks up to 1 Gbps (1 pair  GigE ports)
Netropy N91:  Four separate 1 Gbps emulation engines (4 pairs of GigE ports)
Netropy 10G1:  Emulate complex networks up to 10 Gbps (1 pair 10GbE ports)
Netropy 10G2:  Two separate 10 Gbps emulation engines (2 pairs of 10GbE ports)
Netropy 40G:  World's first 40 Gbps WAN emulator (1 pair 40GbE ports)

 Educational Background



 


Whitman College

                  Whitman College is renowned for combining academic excellence, an unpretentious Northwest culture, and an engaging community.

We are honored to attract students who represent the Whitman mosaic – down-to-earth, high achievers with diverse interests. We are proud of our campus and the diversity and accomplishments of our students, staff, and faculty.

A Whitman education liberates minds, inspires spirit and unleashes imagination. It fosters relationships that last a lifetime. We value community – on campus and off.

Whitman holds dear the traditions and value of a liberal arts education, yet the college continually evolves itself to ensure that graduates are prepared for futures that offer limitless possibilities.                





 Career History



Director of Client Services

                                    2006 - Current                


Steelhead Partners LLC


                  Steelhead Partners manages funds and separate accounts using two core investment strategies: a fundamental value equity long-short strategy and/or a convertible bond strategy. In managing the fundamental value strategy, Steelhead seeks to identify a core portfolio of companies that are valued below what they believe to be their intrinsic value. In managing the convertible bond strategy, they seek to achieve value by investing in bonds that are convertible into equity securities.For the fundamental value strategy, Steelhead's research methods focuses on the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet of the companies in which it invests. The strategy is relatively long term in nature, with a typical time horizon of 2 to 5 years. Steelhead may also employ two additional strategies: active trading of securities they believe have been oversold or overbought on the basis of short-term considerations and short selling for hedging, pairs trades, or trading gains. Although the strategy generally emphasizes investments in equity securities (or securities with equity-like characteristics), Steelhead generally may invest or trade in any type of securities including bonds, notes, convertible bonds or preferred stock, warrants, options and money market instruments among other financial instruments.For the convertible bond strategy, Steelhead generally seeks securities which offer favorable risk/reward characteristics within the convertible securities market. They may seek to enhance this strategy’s risk/reward profile by leveraging their clients’ equity capital. In addition, this strategy may involve investments, trades or short trades in various types of securities beyond convertible securities, including straight (non-convertible) debt and preferred securities, common stocks, ETFs, options, futures, warrants and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, and options on such derivatives.

 Educational Background



Sociology Degree 


Skidmore College

                  Skidmore College has undergone many transformations since its founding in the early twentieth century as a women's college. The Young Women's Industrial Club was formed in 1903 by Lucy Ann Skidmore (1853–1931) with inheritance money from her husband who died in 1879, and from her father, Joseph Russell Skidmore (1821–1882), a former coal merchant. In 1911, the club was chartered under the name "Skidmore School of Arts" as a college to vocationally and professionally train young women. It "prepares illustrators, designers, dieticians, accountants, secretaries and costumers.

 Career History



Controller

                                    2001 - Current                


Steelhead Partners LLC


                  Steelhead Partners manages funds and separate accounts using two core investment strategies: a fundamental value equity long-short strategy and/or a convertible bond strategy. In managing the fundamental value strategy, Steelhead seeks to identify a core portfolio of companies that are valued below what they believe to be their intrinsic value. In managing the convertible bond strategy, they seek to achieve value by investing in bonds that are convertible into equity securities.For the fundamental value strategy, Steelhead's research methods focuses on the income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet of the companies in which it invests. The strategy is relatively long term in nature, with a typical time horizon of 2 to 5 years. Steelhead may also employ two additional strategies: active trading of securities they believe have been oversold or overbought on the basis of short-term considerations and short selling for hedging, pairs trades, or trading gains. Although the strategy generally emphasizes investments in equity securities (or securities with equity-like characteristics), Steelhead generally may invest or trade in any type of securities including bonds, notes, convertible bonds or preferred stock, warrants, options and money market instruments among other financial instruments.For the convertible bond strategy, Steelhead generally seeks securities which offer favorable risk/reward characteristics within the convertible securities market. They may seek to enhance this strategy’s risk/reward profile by leveraging their clients’ equity capital. In addition, this strategy may involve investments, trades or short trades in various types of securities beyond convertible securities, including straight (non-convertible) debt and preferred securities, common stocks, ETFs, options, futures, warrants and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, and options on such derivatives.
