No. 9”) amends the Schedule 13D originally filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)

collectively referred to herein as the “Schedule 13D”):

The
Schedule 13D relates to the shares of Common Stock (the “Stock”) of NTN Buzztime, Inc. (the “Issuer”)
owned by Matador Capital Partners, L.P. (the “Fund”), BFK Investments LLC (“BFK”), the general
partner of the Fund, and Jeffrey A. Berg, the Managing Member of BFK. The Fund, BFK and Jeffrey A. Berg are collectively referred
to herein as the “Reporting Persons”. Except as specifically amended by this Amendment No. 9, items in the
Schedule 13D are unchanged.
 
This
Amendment No. 9 reports a decrease in the Reporting Persons’ percentage of beneficial ownership of the outstanding shares
of Stock since the date the Reporting Persons’ last filing on Schedule 13D as a result of the Issuer’s issuance of
200,000 shares of Stock in connection with a registered direct offering that the Issuer completed on March 31, 2017 (the “March
2017 Offering”). None of the Reporting Persons acquired any shares of Stock in the March 2017 Offering.
 
Information
in this Amendment No. 9 with respect to each of the Reporting Persons is given solely by that particular Reporting Person, and
none of the other Reporting Persons has any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of information with respect to any
other Reporting Person. Capitalized terms used herein that are not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule
13D.
 
Item
3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration
 
The
information provided in Item 5 of this Amendment No. 9 is incorporated by reference to this Item 3.
 
Item
3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following at the end thereof:
 
In
November 2016, the Fund purchased 5,620 shares of Stock reported in Item 5 of this Amendment No. 9 using its working capital.
The aggregate purchase price was $40,679.
 
Item
5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer
 
Paragraphs
(a), (b) and (d) of Item 5 of the Schedule 13D are hereby amended by replacing them in their entirety with the following:
 

 
 

 
(a),
(b) & (d): Each Reporting Person’s beneficial ownership of the Stock on the date of this Amendment No. 9 is reflected
on that Reporting Person’s cover page of this Amendment No.9. The percentage of shares owned by the Reporting Persons is
based upon 2,483,892 shares of Stock outstanding, which is the number of shares outstanding immediately after the March 2017 Offering,
as reported in the Issuer’s filings with the SEC. BFK is a limited liability company and serves as the general partner of
the Fund with the power to invest in, vote and dispose of the Stock on behalf the Fund. The Fund has the right to receive or the
power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the Stock. Only Mr. Berg as a limited partner
in the Fund individually has an interest through the Fund in more than 5% of the outstanding Stock. Mr. Berg is the Managing Member
of BFK and controls the investment decisions of BFK and the Fund. The Reporting Persons are filing the Schedule 13D jointly, but
not as members of a group, and each of them expressly disclaims membership in a group. Each of BFK and Mr. Berg disclaims beneficial
ownership of the Stock except to the extent of that Reporting Person’s pecuniary interest therein. In addition, the filing
of the Schedule 13D on behalf of the Fund should not be construed as an admission that any of the other Reporting Persons is,
and each of them disclaims that it is, the beneficial owner, as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
of any of the Stock covered by the Schedule 13D.
 
Paragraph
(c) of Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by the addition of the following:
 
(c)
The following sets forth all transactions with respect to Shares effected by the Reporting Persons since their last filing on
Schedule 13D: In November 2016, the Fund purchased 5,620 shares of Stock using its working capital, the aggregate purchase price
for which was $40,679. Except as otherwise noted above, all such transactions were purchases of Shares effected in the open market,
and the purchase price includes commissions paid.

After
reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief, I certify that the information set forth in this statement is true,
complete and correct.
