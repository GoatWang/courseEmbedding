      Fitch Rates Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2
    





May 20, 2015 04:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2:
    

      --$205,000,000 class A-1a 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$205,000,000 class A-1b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$290,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$290,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$95,400,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63,650,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60,300,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$53,600,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$67,000,000 class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Characteristics: The 2015-2 pool is representative of 
      nonprime collateral, with a 633 weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. 
      (FICO) score, 8.76% WA annual percentage rate (APR) and 104% WA 
      loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Of the pool, 60% consists of new vehicle 
      contracts, while extended-term contracts total 77%, all relatively 
      consistent with recent securitized pools.
    

      One-Year Revolving Period Risk: The revolving structure introduces risk 
      of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the 
      amortization period, although eligibility criteria pertaining to the 
      additional receivables may mitigate some of this risk. Fitch accounts 
      for collateral migration in its derivation of the base case loss proxy 
      for 2015-2.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      class A notes totals 19.50%. The non-declining reserve is 0.50%, 
      subordination totals 18.25% and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 
      0.75%, growing to a target of 2.25% after the revolving period.
    

      Stable Portfolio Performance: AFIN's nonprime auto loan portfolio has 
      shown improved performance relative to the weak 2006-2008 period, given 
      the gradual improvements in the U.S. economy and healthy used vehicle 
      values. Fitch's base case loss proxy for 2015-2 is 5.60%; however, 
      Fitch's ABS extrapolation based on outstanding CARAT transactions out of 
      the revolving period is below 3.00%.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+/B'/Outlook 
      Stable. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      nonprime portfolios and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2 to increased 
      losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the 
      notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In 
      fact, they could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category 
      under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's 
      severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated May 8, 2015. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-2 - Appendix'. These R&Ws are 
      compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the 
      special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms 
      in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 2015.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in 
      Fitch's presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

Canadian Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust II






Jan 14, 2015, 2:11pm EST















TORONTO, Jan. 14, 2015 /CNW/ - Canadian Capital Auto Receivables Asset
 Trust II ("CCARAT II") announced that it has been advised by Royal Bank
 of Canada ("RBC") that RBC, as Servicer, intends to elect to exercise
 its option to purchase all right, title and interest of CCARAT II in
 the portfolio of secured loans which secure the payment of (i) the
 3.321% Auto Loan Receivables-Backed Notes, Series 2011-1, Class A-3,
 (ii) the 4.146% Auto Loan Receivables-Backed Notes, Series 2011-1,

      Fitch Rates Affirms 9 Classes from Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 
      2015-2
    





May 03, 2016 04:51 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed nine 
      classes of Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust (CARAT) 2015-2 as 
      follows:
    

      --Class A-1a at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-1b at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class D at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating actions are based on available credit enhancement (CE) and 
      loss performance to date. The collateral pool continues to perform 
      within Fitch's expectations. Under the current structure and CE, the 
      securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the 
      assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with 
      the terms of the documents.
    

      The initial recommended loss proxy of 5.60% for 2015-2 incorporated an 
      additional stress considering the potential post-revolving worst-case 
      collateral pool. This approach took into consideration a negative 
      migration of the pool characteristics assuming the collateral migrates 
      to the maximum collateral concentration limits during the revolving 
      period.
    

      To date, the additional collateral added to the pool in the revolving 
      period has been consistent when compared to the initial pool. There have 
      been minimal negative migrations with only one month left before the 
      revolving period ends, after which the transaction will begin to 
      amortize. As a result of the consistent collateral, increased seasoning, 
      and low loss performance, Fitch revised its loss proxy down to 5.25%.
    

      The revised proxy excludes the aforementioned additional stress given 
      that there is only one month left during the revolving period, and Fitch 
      expects the collateral to be very similar to the original pool mix at 
      the end of this period.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of Ally Financial Inc.'s (AFIN) retail 
      auto loan originations, the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transaction, and the strength of the servicing provided by Ally.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transactions. Lower loss coverage could affect the ratings and 
      Rating Outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectations. To date, the transactions have exhibited strong 
      performance with losses well within Fitch's initial expectations, with 
      rising loss coverage and multiple levels. As such, a material 
      deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools 
      to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings.
