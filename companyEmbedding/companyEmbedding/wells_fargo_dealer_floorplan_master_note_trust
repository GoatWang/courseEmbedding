Fitch Affirms 5 Wells Fargo Dealer Floorplan Master Note Trust Series | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms 5 Wells Fargo Dealer Floorplan Master Note Trust Series
    





November 09, 2016 06:17 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following outstanding notes issued by the 
      Wells Fargo Dealer Floorplan Master Note Trust (WF DFMNT) as a result of 
      its annual review of the trust:
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2012-2
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2014-1
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2014-2
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2015-1
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2015-2
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      Fitch does not rate the class D notes for series 2012-2, 2015-1, and 
      2015-2.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmation of the notes reflects the available loss coverage and 
      stable performance of the trusts' collateral, which all continue to 
      perform within Fitch's initial expectations.
    

      In applying its dealer floorplan (DFP) rating criteria for the initial 
      rating of each series, Fitch determined WF DFMNT to be a Category A 
      platform. Based on its low systemic risk profile, Fitch's analysis 
      embodied two distinct approaches - Historical Default Multiplier base 
      case approach, and the Concentration Coverage approach. Under each 
      approach, all series' modelled net loss coverage levels are able to 
      withstand stresses commensurate with Fitch's assigned ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks.
    

      The assets securing the notes consist of an undivided interest in a pool 
      of diversified revolving DFP receivables that were originated by WF 
      Commercial Distribution Finance (formerly known as GE Commercial 
      Distribution Finance) and other originators, and are utilized to provide 
      wholesale financing to U.S. dealers and are secured by the products 
      financed.
    

      WF DFMNT is backed by receivables from approximately 12 different 
      product lines, including marine, recreational vehicles, motor sports, 
      power sports, consumer electronics, appliances and transportation.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For the initial rating of each series, Fitch conducted a rating 
      sensitivity for the issued notes, under a category A DFP platform. Fitch 
      assumed portfolio default levels at 5%, 15%, and 25% and under two 
      recovery level scenarios of 50% and 30%. Fitch modelled each series with 
      the assumption that the above defaults have occurred, reflecting asset 
      performance in a stressed environment. Remaining expected loss levels 
      were compared with the stressed loss assumption grid commensurate with 
      various rating levels.
    

      To date, performance for the trust has remained strong. A material 
      deterioration would have to occur in performance to have potential 
      negative impact on the ratings for each series.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to

Fitch assumed portfolio default levels at 5%, 15%, and 25% and under two recovery level scenarios of 50% and 30%. Fitch modelled each series with the assumption that the above defaults have occurred, reflecting asset performance in a stressed environment.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following outstanding notes issued by the 
      Wells Fargo Dealer Floorplan Master Note Trust (WF DFMNT) as a result of 
      its annual review of the trust:
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2012-2
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2014-1
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2014-2
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2015-1
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      WF DFMNT, Series 2015-2
    

      --Class A: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class C: 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      Fitch does not rate the class D notes for series 2012-2, 2015-1, and 
      2015-2.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmation of the notes reflects the available loss coverage and 
      stable performance of the trusts' collateral, which all continue to 
      perform within Fitch's initial expectations.
    

      In applying its dealer floorplan (DFP) rating criteria for the initial 
      rating of each series, Fitch determined WF DFMNT to be a Category A 
      platform. Based on its low systemic risk profile, Fitch's analysis 
      embodied two distinct approaches - Historical Default Multiplier base 
      case approach, and the Concentration Coverage approach. Under each 
      approach, all series' modelled net loss coverage levels are able to 
      withstand stresses commensurate with Fitch's assigned ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks.
    

      The assets securing the notes consist of an undivided interest in a pool 
      of diversified revolving DFP receivables that were originated by WF 
      Commercial Distribution Finance (formerly known as GE Commercial 
      Distribution Finance) and other originators, and are utilized to provide 
      wholesale financing to U.S. dealers and are secured by the products 
      financed.
    

      WF DFMNT is backed by receivables from approximately 12 different 
      product lines, including marine, recreational vehicles, motor sports, 
      power sports, consumer electronics, appliances and transportation.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For the initial rating of each series, Fitch conducted a rating 
      sensitivity for the issued notes, under a category A DFP platform. Fitch 
      assumed portfolio default levels at 5%, 15%, and 25% and under two 
      recovery level scenarios of 50% and 30%. Fitch modelled each series with 
      the assumption that the above defaults have occurred, reflecting asset 
      performance in a stressed environment. Remaining expected loss levels 
      were compared with the stressed loss assumption grid commensurate with 
      various rating levels.
    

      To date, performance for the trust has remained strong. A material 
      deterioration would have to occur in performance to have potential 
      negative impact on the ratings for each series.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in

      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public

      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,

      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a

      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other

BackRating Action: Moody's assigns definitive ratings to Navistar Financial Dealer Note Master Owner Trust II, Series 2017-1 Notes
MCO$132.57+5.40 +4.25%
Released : Thursday, June 29, 2017 6:01 AMRelease date- 28062017 - Moody's Investors Service, ('Moody's') has assigned definitive ratings to the notes issued by Navistar Financial Dealer Note Master Owner Trust II, Series 2017-1 Notes (NAVMOT 2017-1).
The notes will be backed by dealer floorplan loans originated by Navistar Financial Corporation (NFC; unrated), who is also the sponsor and servicer of the transaction.
The complete rating actions are as follows:
Issuer: Navistar Financial Dealer Note Master Owner Trust II, series 2017-1
$211,330,000, LIBOR + 0.78%, Class A Floating Rate Dealer Note Asset Backed Notes, Definitive Rating Assigned Aaa (sf)
$13,120,000, LIBOR + 1.25%, Class B Floating Rate Dealer Note Asset Backed Notes, Definitive Rating Assigned Aa3 (sf)
$11,740,000, LIBOR + 1.55%, Class C Floating Rate Dealer Note Asset Backed Notes, Definitive Rating Assigned A2 (sf)
$13,810,000, LIBOR + 2.30%, Class D Floating Rate Dealer Note Asset Backed Notes, Definitive Rating Assigned Baa3 (sf)
RATINGS RATIONALE
The ratings are based on the quality of the underlying auto dealer floorplan receivables, the strength of the capital structure, and the experience and expertise of NFC as the servicer.
Moody's Aaa level for NAVMOT 2017-1 is 25%. The Aaa level is the level of credit enhancement consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating. Moody's based the Aaa level on an analysis of the quality of the floorplan receivables and the transaction's structural features. A primary consideration for assessing the quality of the floorplan receivables is the strength of the manufacturer and the vehicles to which the dealerships and the receivables have exposure. Moody's also considered the size of the dealership base that is part of NAVMOT, the overall trust monthly payment rate, and the ability of NFC to perform servicing functions. Other factors driving our analysis of NAVMOT include the transaction's credit enhancement step-up trigger(s), early amortization trigger, and vehicle values under stressed scenarios.
At closing, the Class A notes, Class B notes, Class C notes, and Class D notes benefit from 25.00%, 20.25%, 16.00%, and 11.00% of hard credit enhancement, respectively. Hard credit enhancement for the notes consists of a combination of overcollateralization, a non-declining reserve account, and subordination, except for Classs D, which does not benefit from any subordination.
PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGY
The principal methodology used in these ratings was 'Moody's Approach to Rating Floorplan Asset-Backed Securities' published in Ocotber 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
On 22 March 2017, Moody's released a Request for Comment, in which it has requested market feedback on potential revisions to its 'Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance'. If the revised Methodology is implemented as proposed, the Credit Rating on NAVMOT 2017-1 is not expected to be affected. Please refer to Moody's Request for Comment, titled 'Moody's Proposes Revisions to Its Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance,' for further details regarding the implications of the proposed Methodology revisions on certain Credit Ratings.
Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:
Up
Moody's could upgrade the notes if levels of credit enhancement are higher than necessary to protect investors against current expectations of portfolio losses. Losses could decline from Moody's original expectations as a result of a lower number of dealer defaults or appreciation in the value of the assets securing a dealer's promise of payment. Additionally, a strengthening credit profile of manufacturers and/or dealers could decrease expectations for loss. Portfolio losses also depend greatly on US economic performance. Other reasons for better-than-expected performance include changes to servicing practices that enhance collections.
Down
Moody's could downgrade the notes if levels of credit enhancement are insufficient to protect investors against current expectations of portfolio losses. Losses could rise above Moody's original expectations as a result of a higher number of dealer defaults or deterioration in the value of the assets securing a dealer's promise of payment. Additionally, a weakening credit profile of manufacturers and/or dealers could increase expectations for loss. Portfolio losses also depend greatly on US economic performance. Other reasons for worse-than-expected performance include poor servicing, error on the part of transaction parties, inadequate transaction governance and fraud.
Stress Scenarios:
As the Loss and Cash Flow Analysis section in the 'Regulatory Disclosures' section describes below, in our simulation analysis we assumed that Navistar International Corporation, the manufacturer of the vehicles backing the receivables in this transaction, was rated Caa3, three notches below its current long term rating of B3. Our simulation analysis incorporated a stressed average dealer default rate of approximately 50%. On average, our assumptions for recovery rates of repossessed vehicles from defaulted dealers is 90% for new vehicles and 85% for used vehicles. Average stressed recovery rates applied under manufacturer bankruptcy scenarios were generally between 50% and 45%, with a low of 35%.
Additional research including a pre-sale report for this transaction is available at www.moodys.com.
REGULATORY DISCLOSURES
For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.
Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on
http://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBS-1079611
The analysis relies on a Monte Carlo simulation that generates a large number of collateral loss or cash flow scenarios, which on average meet key metrics Moody's determines based on its assessment of the collateral characteristics. Moody's then evaluates each simulated scenario using model that replicates the relevant structural features and payment allocation rules of the transaction, to derive losses or payments for each rated instrument. The average loss a rated instrument incurs in all of the simulated collateral loss or cash flow scenarios, which Moody's weights based on its assumptions about the likelihood of events in such scenarios actually occurring, results in the expected loss of the rated instrument.
Moody's describes the stress scenarios it has considered for this rating action in the section 'Ratings Rationale' of this press release.
For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.
For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.
Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating review.
Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued the rating.
Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

                6L’andamento di questo rating riflette accuratamente lo stato attuale dell’indicatore (sf) ma, a causa di limiti di natura tecnica, non riflette in maniera accurata la storia dell’indicatore stesso (sf). Vi invitiamo a consultare la Research Tab e visualizzare i Comunicati Stampa che riportano quando l’indicatore (sf) sia stato aggiunto o tolto.


        Per i rating del credito derivati esclusivamente da un rating preesistente del credito di un programma, di una serie, categoria/classe di debito, ente fornitore di supporto o soggetto primario valutato, o che sostituiscono un rating provvisorio assegnato in precedenza allo stesso livello di rating, Moody’s pubblica un annuncio di rating su tutta questa serie, categoria/classe di debito o programma, sull’ente fornitore di supporto o soggetto primario valutato, o sul rating provvisorio, ma spesso non pubblica un annuncio di rating specifico su ciascun bond o titolo successivo per cui il rating del credito è derivato dal rating del credito preesistente. Gli annunci di rating in genere sono comunicati stampa classificati come Rating Actions su www.moodys.com. Si prega di fare riferimento alla tabella Ricerca sulla pagina dell’emittente/soggetto per l’annuncio di rating.

The net expense ratio takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 03/31/2018. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

Ratings (other than U.S. Treasury securities or securities issued or backed by U.S. agencies) provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. For certain securities that are not rated by any of these three agencies, credit ratings from other agencies may be used. Where the rating agencies rate a security differently, Lord Abbett uses the median, but if there are only two ratings, the lower rating is used. Ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Bonds rated BBB or above are considered investment grade. Credit ratings BB and below are lower-rated securities (junk bonds). High-yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risks than investment-grade bonds. Adverse conditions may affect the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal on these securities. A portion of the portfolio's securities may not be rated. Breakdown is not an S&P credit rating or an opinion of S&P as to the creditworthiness of such portfolio. Ratings apply to the credit worthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not the fund or its shares. Ratings may be subject to change.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Ratings (other than U.S. Treasury securities or securities issued or backed by U.S. agencies) provided by Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. For certain securities that are not rated by any of these three agencies, credit ratings from other agencies may be used. Where the rating agencies rate a security differently, Lord Abbett uses the median, but if there are only two ratings, the lower rating is used. Ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). Bonds rated BBB or above are considered investment grade. Credit ratings BB and below are lower-rated securities (junk bonds). High-yielding, non-investment-grade bonds (junk bonds) involve higher risks than investment-grade bonds. Adverse conditions may affect the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal on these securities. A portion of the portfolio's securities may not be rated. Breakdown is not an S&P credit rating or an opinion of S&P as to the creditworthiness of such portfolio. Ratings apply to the credit worthiness of the issuers of the underlying securities and not the fund or its shares. Ratings may be subject to change.






Portfolio Positioning as of 03/31/2017

The portfolio maintained its diversified exposure, beyond the treasury bonds represented in its benchmark, the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Bill Index.  The portfolio primarily invests in investment grade bonds with floating rate coupons, commercial paper, and AAA-rated asset-backed securities, all with short maturities.
The portfolio focuses on short maturity investment grade debt in an effort to generate higher total returns than cash or money market funds, with less interest rate risk than short or intermediate term bonds.
3-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) continued to rise, ending the quarter at 1.15%, 50 basis points higher than levels seen last summer. Higher LIBOR rates may benefit the strategy, as large portions of the portfolio have floating rate coupons tied to LIBOR.

Average Coupon - The weighted average annual rate of interest on a bond’s face value that the issuer agrees to pay the holder until maturity for all the securities in a portfolio.




Average Maturity - The length of time until the average security in a portfolio will mature or be redeemed by its issuer in proportion to its dollar value. Indicating a portfolio’s sensitivity to general market interest rate changes, a longer average maturity implies greater relative portfolio volatility.




Average Effective Duration - The change in the value of a fixed income security that will result from a 1% change in interest rates, taking into account anticipated cash flow fluctuations from mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons, and potential call dates. Duration is expressed as a number of years, and generally, the larger a duration, the greater the interest-rate risk or reward for a portfolio’s underlying bond prices. Where applicable, certain investments, such as common or preferred stock, convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock, ETFs, ADRs, and CPI swaps and related futures, are excluded from these calculations.

Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense ratio takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 03/31/2018. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

Minimum initial investment varies depending on the class of shares you buy and the type of account. IRAs, SIMPLEs, and SEP accounts with payroll deductions have no minimums. Please see Fund prospectuses for additional information.      
                    




1
Dividend Yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a mutual fund pays out in dividends each year relative to value with maximum sales charges and without sales charges. The dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the last dividend and dividing it by the fund’s net asset value with maximum sales charges and without sales charges.
 




2
The 30-Day Standardized Yield represents net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period. It is expressed as an annual percentage rate using a method of calculation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Yields for other share classes will vary.
 




3
The Fund’s Dividend Yield and 12-Month Dividend Yield are shown with and without sales charges and with maximum sales charges. The Fund’s Subsidized Dividend yield takes into account any fee waiver or expense limitation arrangements, if any. Without such fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements, the Fund’s dividend yield would have been lower. Information regarding any fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements applicable to the Fund is provided with the Fund’s expense ratio information.
 




4
The Fund’s Unsubsidized Dividend yield is shown without sales charges and with maximum sales charges. The Fund’s unsubsidized dividend yield reflects what the yield would have been without the effect of fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements.
 
 




5
The 30-day Standardized Subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect. Without such fee waivers, yields would be reduced.  
 




6
The 30-day Standardized Unsubsidized yield does not reflect fee waivers.






 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION
 




headingView Disclosure




There is no up-front commission on purchases of the Lord Abbett Ultra Short Bond Fund, but a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) will be charged on shares exchanged from a Lord Abbett–sponsored fund that are subject to a CDSC and that are subsequently redeemed. Lord Abbett Ultra Short Bond Fund has a 12b-1 trail commission of 0.15% that accrues immediately.

New Fund Risk: The Fund is newly organized. There can be no assurance that the Fund will reach or maintain a sufficient asset size to effectively implement its investing strategy.







headingView Disclosure




A Note about Risk: The Fund is subject to the general risks associated with investing in debt securities, including market, credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk. The value of an investment in the Fund will change as interest rates fluctuate in response to market movements. When interest rates rise, the prices of debt securities are likely to decline, and when interest rates fall, the prices of debt securities tend to rise. Debt securities are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer will fail to make timely payments of interest and principal to the Fund. The Fund may invest in foreign or emerging market securities, which may be adversely affected by economic, political, or regulatory factors and subject to currency volatility and greater liquidity risk. The Fund may invest in derivatives, which are subject to greater liquidity, leverage, and counterparty risk. Although the Fund may invest in money market securities, this is not a money market fund. These factors can affect Fund performance. As it is a newly organized fund, the Fund’s performance at this time is very limited. The Fund's performance achieved during its initial period of investment operation may not be replicated over longer periods and may not be indicative of how the Fund will perform in the future. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.







 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.
