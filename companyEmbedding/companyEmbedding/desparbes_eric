Other risks affecting Theravance are described under the headings "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in Theravance's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 7, 2014.

Consensus Ratings for NN (NASDAQ:NNBR) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $33.50 (21.16% upside)

"Kouji Kodera has left HTC to pursue other interests,” said HTC yesterday. “We appreciate his contributions and wish him all the best. Scott Croyle will take over his duties.” Mr Kodera, the Chief Product Officer, joins the communications chief Jason Gordon, who left Friday, as well as several other marketing and communications people, one of whom, Eric Lin, went to work for Skype, leaving the tweet you see above behind him. A lot is hanging for HTC on the sales of the One, and key staff departure is unlikely to make things easier for the struggling phone maker.via AllThingsD & TheRegister

One guess: The factors that allowed HTC to slip in status these past 12-24 months appear to be boiling over publicly.

There has been unrest among the HTC staff since a few years. Last year, there were massive layoffs in the HTC factories. I really believe the board of directors need to remodel their thinking on what's best for the company or just resign if they can't. The blame should definitely NOT be on the talented people who actually make those great HTC products, like the formidable HTC One!!

The problem for HTC is not with the One, as that is on autopilot, barring further supply disruptions.  HTC has to worry what they are going to do for their next toy after the One.

It would appear that there is a certain amount of discord within HTC.  I really hope the turn-around that started with the One does not stall.

htc really needs to make one flagship and stick with it, and not make multiple flagship devices in a period of 6 months. Look at sensation, One X, One X+, Butterfly, Butterly S? People are confused as HTC doesnt really have a true HTC flagship name like Galaxy S, Lumia and Xperia. Theres really not much to remember about HTC but the fact that they make too many flagship phones in a short period of time.

They need to change their marketing strategy, have more supplies in stock and create a true flagship name.

I don't buy the "too many flagships" argument. What's the difference between HTC marketing both the One and Butterfly and Samsung marketing both the Galaxy S and Note? Samsung uniting everything they sell under the Galaxy name? I think that dilutes the brand. And the One X to One X+ was a midyear refresh that kept the phone competitive. I don't see it as a bad thing. 

Now if they start selling a 4.7", 5", 5.5", and 6"flagship, then maybe image with you.

Well if HTC sell's too many flagship phones, people who are willing to upgrade feels like they need to chose a different phone brand. For example people who currently owns a galaxy S2 or S3, it would make sense for them to upgrade to an S3 or an S4 if they had great user experience, thinking the next one will be much better. In HTC's situation, when people are upgrading from (sensation, Butterfly or ONE X), they might get confused whether they will get the same user experience or not when upgrading to a phone with a different name (HTC ONE, HTC 8X, Butterfly S). 

In short, some people have loyalty not just on the brand itself, but on the particular flagship name as well, same thing as liking the sports Basketball, but there's one team that you like the most (GO Boston Celtics).

That I'll agree with. HTC took too long to come up with the unified brand name One. Last year was a good first step releasing the One S and One X, but they were still stuck with carrier exclusivity, and Verizon and Sprint still demanded their own customized Droid and Evo versions. This is similar to where Samsung was with the Galaxy S2. By the following year, Samsung had enough clout to get the S3 released as a unified brand.

This year HTC finally has the flagship One on 3 of the big 4 carriers, and on numerous international carriers. I don't know that Butterfly (or Droid DNA) is a great, readily identifiable brand name for HTC to use, but if they release a follow-up this year under the same name, they're at least minimizing their marques.

Apple has outsourced its assembleing unit to Foxconn ( A chinese company ) They are exploiting their workers as slaves resulting into suicides. An independent chinese auditor even called  Foxconn's management style, inhumane and abusive.

Don't hate on the state of Canada. Many of America's best comedians are from Canada. Plus we're going to need all that oil from the Tar Sand State to survive the coming apocalypse.

This is not a Chinese company, HTC is from Taiwan, it is a Taiwan company, yes, Foxconn have horrible working conditions and they treat their employees like slaves and many workers in Foxconn have committed suicide, but not all Chinese companies are like that!

The worst company is Foxconn.

And yet that hasn't stopped Apple or Amazon from manufacturing their products there. Every time I see a report of another suicide at Foxconn, I hold Apple partly responsible.

Actually apparently the Wiki that had this "fact" was using the asian or european terms and off by a factor of 100 (Calling Billions Trillions, etc.. )  The business insider has them at 3.6 Billion in operating income. Total revenue of 130 Billion.. still a lot.. but not 3.4 Trillion :)
