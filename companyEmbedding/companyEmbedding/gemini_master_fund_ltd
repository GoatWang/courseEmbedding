CDEX Signs Financing Agreement for up to $2.5 Million and Closes First Tranche for $1 Million With Gemini Master Fund, Ltd.
June 30, 2008, by Marketing, Posted in Press Releases, Comments Off on CDEX Signs Financing Agreement for up to $2.5 Million and Closes First Tranche for $1 Million With Gemini Master Fund, Ltd.
As Demand for Products Increases, New Funding Enables CDEX to Expand Its Product Portfolio and Distribution Into Global Markets; Investor Call-In Teleconference Scheduled for July 8, 2008 to Discuss Financing Package
TUCSON, AZ–(Marketwire – June 30, 2008) – CDEX Inc. (OTCBB: CEXI) announced today that on June 25, it signed a financing agreement for up to $2.5 million and closed the first $1 million tranche of the financing with Gemini Master Fund, Ltd., an investment fund with offices in New York City and San Diego, CA. The financing is in the form of a two-year Convertible Debenture with rights of conversion into CDEX Class A Common Stock at a fixed conversion price.
“As an investor we are attracted to CDEX because their technologies are compelling in two very important markets: improving patient safety in hospitals by validating high-risk medications (the ValiMed™ product line) and detecting trace amounts of illegal substances such as methamphetamine (the ID2, Meth Scanner™ product line),” said Steven Winters, Founder and Portfolio Manager of Gemini Strategies, LLC. “We like CDEX’s product market space, management team, expanding client base and technology potential for the future, and are pleased to be an investor in the Company.”
“Over a year ago we began the search for a major investment partner to assist in our road to profitability without jeopardizing the Company’s future or existing shareholders,” said Malcolm Philips, CDEX CEO. “Steve Winters and his Gemini Team have worked with us in fashioning an investment package that accomplishes these goals. We can now step up the pace of our strategic plans, including expansion of our product portfolio and distribution into global markets for both ValiMed and the Meth Scanner, acceleration of our R&D efforts for market entry of new product lines, and establishing a solid program of investor relations for our existing and new shareholders On July 8, 2008 at 11:00 a.m. EDT, I will hold an open line teleconference to answer questions from investors regarding this financing package (monitorwww.cdexinc.com for details).”
The ValiMed™ Medication Validation System is used both to train compounding pharmtechs/nurses and to validate high-risk medication admixtures, as well as returned narcotics, to provide an increased level of patient safety. ValiMed compares a medication’s spectroscopic signature to the expected signature from the ValiMed database to detect significant medication and concentration errors as well as accidental and deliberate contamination, and provides the results in real time.
The CDEX ID2 Meth Scanner™ is a hand-held, battery operated device that detects low nanogram range quantities of methamphetamine in a continuous scan mode from standoff distances of around 2-8 inches. The product uses the same proven technology employed in ValiMed™ units around the world to give instantaneous results without disturbing the surfaces under investigation. The Meth Scanner has wide marketability across law enforcement, military and homeland security markets and growing potential for property inspection, including homes, commercial buildings and automobiles, to assure their freedom from methamphetamine contamination.

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 2 of 14

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Defendant Oxysure respectfully moves this Court to dismiss this case or transfer this 

matter to the already pending, first-filed matter seeking rescission in the Eastern District of Texas. 

The reasons are simple: 

? This Court does not have personal jurisdiction over Oxysure—Oxysure does not 
have ongoing or continuous contacts with New York and so no general 
jurisdiction lies, and New York has no relationship to this dispute between a Texas 
company and two California lenders, thus no specific jurisdiction lies. 

? 

If this Court determines it has personal jurisdiction, it should defer to the first-
filed matter in the first instance to decide venue. Currently, whether the case may 
properly be brought in Texas or should be transferred to New York is the subject 
of a § 1404 motion pending there and its decision should be respected by this 
Court. 

? The Texas action does not seek to enforce the agreement(s), it seeks to rescind the 
transaction in its entirety because it was induced by fraud, and/or is not the product 
of a meeting of the minds—thus, the choice of forum clause is inapplicable. 

? The choice-of-forum provision in the agreement is unconscionable as written—it 
is unilateral and only applies to Oxysure—thus, there is no grounds on which to 
say that the parties have rationally consented to New York as a venue. 

Plaintiffs hang their proverbial hats on the choice of forum clause. However, it is 

insufficient on its own to confer personal jurisdiction. This case arises between two California 

based plaintiffs and a Texas-based defendant. There is no nexus whatsoever to the State of New 

York under the long-arm statute. 

Furthermore, this Case should be dismissed in favor of the pending Texas action where 

Plaintiffs here (defendants there) have raised the issue of venue in a motion to transfer. The first-

filed rule states that the court of first-impression has the right to determine whether to dismiss or 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 2 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 3 of 14

transfer the case, and that the second-filed court should dismiss its own action out of deference 

to that determination. 

II. 

MOTION TO DISMISS FOR LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION 

Oxysure moves to dismiss this matter for lack of personal jurisdiction. As this Court is 

well-aware, personal jurisdiction can only be predicated on two grounds: either general or 

specific. 

A. There are No Grounds for Exercising Jurisdiction Under the Long Arm Statute 

Plaintiffs have alleged no grounds for the exercise of jurisdiction. This Court only has 

jurisdiction over Oxysure, a foreign corporation, if Oxysure’s activities satisfy a prong of the 

New York Long-Arm Statute, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302. See Aquiline Capital Partners LLC v. 

FinArch LLC, 861 F. Supp. 2d 378, 386 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). 

In general, “New York courts have cautioned ... that defendants … should be subject to 

suit where they are normally found, that is, at their pre-eminent headquarters, or where they 

conduct substantial business activities. Only in a rare case should they be compelled to answer a 

suit in a jurisdiction with which they have the barest of contact.” Id. (citing McKee Elec. Co. v. 

Rauland–Borg Corp., 20 N.Y.2d 377, 383, 20 N.Y.2d 377, 283 N.Y.S.2d 34, 229 N.E.2d 604 

(1967)) (internal quotation marks and additional citation omitted) (emphasis added). 

It is well established that “New York’s long-arm statute … is narrower than the Due 

Process Clause” and thus imposes independent statutory obligations for the exercise of personal 

jurisdiction over a foreign defendant. See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Tryg Int'l Ins. Co., 91 F.3d 

790, 793 (2d Cir. 1996). Thus, where they do not meet the long-arm statute, cased filed in New 

York must nonetheless be dismissed even if it has not been shown that “maintenance of the suit 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 3 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 4 of 14

[offends] traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice” under the Federal Constitution. 

Int'l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Office of Unemployment Comp. & Placement, 326 U.S. 310, 316 

(1945) (internal citations omitted). 

Critically, the New York long-arm statute says nothing of an agreement to consent to 

jurisdiction in New York as being a premise for exercising jurisdiction over a foreign company 

who contracts with another, non-New York domiciled person or entity. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302. 

A mere contract signed between Oxysure and Defendants is insufficient to bring specific or 

general jurisdiction over Oxysure without the statutorily enumerated contacts with New York. 

See Aquiline Capital Partners, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 389. Meanwhile, it is well established that 

“technicalities of the execution of the contract and the contractual provision that the contract was 

made in New York and was to be interpreted according to the law of New York cannot change 

the business realities of the transaction.” S. Mach. Co. v. Mohasco Indus., Inc., 401 F.2d 374, 

381-82 (6th Cir. 1968) (citing Bach v. Friden Calculating Mach. Co., 167 F.2d 679 (6th Cir. 

1948)) (footnote omitted). 

Thus, New York’s long-arm statute does not recognize personal jurisdiction arising from 

contractual relationships absent evidence that “the defendant has transacted any business within 

the state, [and that] the cause of action arises from [] such business transactions.” See Schneider 

v. J & C Carpet Co., 23 A.D.2d 103, 105, (N.Y. 1st Dept. 1965); N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(1). 

Accordingly, this “Court must decide ‘(1) whether the defendant transacts any business in New 

York and, if so, (2) whether this cause of action aris[es] from such a business transaction.’” 

Newman v. Capitol Life Ins. Co., 45 F.Supp.3d 376, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (Rakoff, J.) (quoting 

Best Van Lines, Inc. v. Walker, 490 F.3d 239, 246 (2d Cir. 2007) (additional internal quotation 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 4 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 5 of 14

marks and citation omitted) (brackets in original)). If the answer to either of these questions is 

“no,” then this Court does not have personal jurisdiction over Oxysure. Id. 

“To determine whether a party in a contract action has "transacted business" within the 

meaning of § 302(a)(1), courts consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) whether 

the contract was negotiated and executed in New York, and whether the defendant visited New 

York for the purpose of meeting with the parties after the contract had been executed; (2) whether 

the contract contains a New York choice-of-law clause; (3) whether the contract is to be 

performed in New York; (4) whether the contract requires notices and payments to be sent to 

New York; and (5) defendant's physical presence in New York in connection with an ongoing 

contractual relationship with a New York corporation.” Arista Techs., Inc. v. Arthur D. Little 

Enters., 125 F. Supp. 2d 641, 649-650 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (citations omitted). 

Here, Plaintiffs have alleged no jurisdictional facts at all. There is no dispute that the 

parties’ headquarters are in California and Texas.1 The contract was not consummated in New 

York, nor performed in New York in any fashion.2 Moreover, for a company that has “no New 

York office, no New York mailing address, no New York bank accounts and no employees 

working in New York” whose in-state contacts are “all sporadic and not carried out from a 

permanent location in the State or by its agents or employees in the State,” there is no personal 

jurisdiction under New York’s long-arm statute. Cardone v. Jiminy Peak Inc., 667 N.Y.S.2d 82, 

83 (1997). There is thus zero relationship between this transaction and New York. See Arista 

Techs., 125 F. Supp. 2d at 651 (holding that contracts negotiated in California and performed in 

California would not subject defendant to New York jurisdiction).

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 6 of 14

No court has held that signing a contract in Texas or California (or anywhere other than 

New York) is sufficient to treat one as having “done business within the state” for the purposes 

of the New York long arm statute—in fact, just the opposite is true. See Mayes v. Leipziger, 674 

F.2d 178, 185 (2d Cir. 1982) (“So far as we are aware, no court has extended s 302(a)(1) to reach 

a non-domiciliary who never entered New York, who was solicited outside of New York to 

perform services outside of New York, who performed outside of New York such services as 

were performed, and who is alleged to have neglected to perform other services outside of New 

York.”) (collecting New York cases); Pell v. Clarke, No. 93-cv-332,1994 WL 74075 at *5 

(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 1994) (no personal jurisdiction under C.P.L.R. § 302(a)(1) where plaintiff 

initiated and pressed the business relationship between the parties). 

Thus, there is no personal jurisdiction in New York. “[T]he mere execution of a contract 

[in New York] by a non-domiciliary …with no other contacts … [is not] conclusive as to 

[personal] jurisdiction.” Electronics Devices, Inc. v. Mark Rogers Associates, 60 Misc. 2d 322, 

325, 303 N.Y.S.2d 158, 162 (City Ct. 1969) aff'd sub nom. Elec. Devices, Inc. v. Mark Rogers 

Assoc., 63 Misc. 2d 243, 311 N.Y.S.2d 413 (App. Term 1970) (citing Bundt v. Embro, 27 A.D.2d 

931, 931, 278 N.Y.S.2d 770, 771 [2d Dept 1967] aff'd sub nom. Bundt v. Wallach's Auto Rental, 

Inc., 21 N.Y.2d 1032, 238 N.E.2d 502 [1968])). Even “‘where a defendant’s contacts with New 

York consist of telephone calls, [email] transmissions, and correspondence in connection with 

the negotiation of a contract that has a center of gravity well outside the state,’” the New York 

long-arm statute is not satisfied. See Digital Lab Solutions, LLC v. Stickler, No. 06-cv-6482, 2007 

WL 700821 at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 7, 2007) (quoting Palace Exploration Co. v. Petroleum Dev., 

41 F.Supp.2d 427, 434 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)). 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 7 of 14

While Plaintiffs are sure to refer this Court to decisions holding that venue-selection 

clauses are enforceable, those have nothing to do with the issue of personal jurisdiction and the 

two questions should not be conflated or confused. See Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 254 

(1958) (“The issue is personal jurisdiction, not choice of law. It is resolved in this case by 

considering the acts of the trustee. As we have indicated, they are insufficient to sustain the 

jurisdiction.”). 

And although a choice of New York law can be a relevant factor to consider in weighing 

specific jurisdiction—a venue or choice of law clause “…standing alone, ‘does not constitute a 

voluntary submission to personal jurisdiction.’” CutCo Indus., Inc. v. Naughton, 806 F.2d 361, 

365 (2d Cir. 1986); accord Aquiline Capital Partners LLC, 861 F. Supp. 2d at 386. 

Further weakening Plaintiffs’ argument is the permissive nature of the language. 

Allowing the “Holder” to “waive” the choice of venue and to file anywhere it chose renders the 

clause permissive, and could not likewise be construed as a blanket submission of Oxysure to 

personal jurisdiction no matter where that case was elected to be filed. Accord PowerDsine, Inc. 

v. Broadcom Corp., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6907, *11 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2008) (holding that 

permissive venue selection clause was insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction because 

defendant did not agree to “submit to the jurisdiction of any court”). 

Thus, the choice of venue clause as the only “contact” is insufficient to confer personal 

jurisdiction over Oxysure. 

B. Exercising Personal Jurisdiction Over Oxysure Would be Unconstitutional 

While the New York Long-Arm statute is not co-extensive with the due process clause, 

exercising personal jurisdiction here would indeed violate the U.S. Constitution. Due process 

dictates that personal jurisdiction exists only where there is either general or specific jurisdiction 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 7 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 8 of 14

over Oxysure due to the acts of Oxysure in the forum state. See Hanson, 357 U.S. at 254. At 

minimum, due process requires both that “the defendant on his own initiative … project[] himself 

into” New York, and that the plaintiff identify a substantial nexus between this voluntary 

projection and its cause of action. Parke-Bernet Galleries, Inc. v. Franklyn, 26 N.Y.2d 13, 18 

(1970). See also Paterno v. Laser Spine Inst., 24 N.Y.3d 370, 377 (2014) (“[Defendant must] on 

his [or her] own initiative ... project himself [or herself]’ into this state to engage in a ‘sustained 

and substantial transaction of business.”) (quoting Fischbarg v. Doucet, 9 N.Y.3d 375, 380 

(2007) (first bracket added, remaining brackets in original)). 

It has long been held that “some single or occasional acts” related to the forum may not 

be sufficient to establish jurisdiction if “their nature and quality and the circumstances of their 

commission” create only an “attenuated” affiliation with the forum. See International Shoe Co. 

v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 318 (1945). One such attenuated affiliation with the forum is the 

choice of law/forum selection clause. Courts—include the United States Supreme Court—have 

stated that a forum selection clause standing alone is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction 

without other, substantive contacts. To wit, in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462 

(1985), the Supreme Court held the forum-selection clause “standing alone would be insufficient 

to confer jurisdiction” without the other substantive acts that “reinforced his deliberate affiliation 

with the forum State and the reasonable foreseeability of possible litigation there.” Id. at 482. 

CutCo Indus, 806 F.2d 361, 366-367, citing Burger King held that but-for post-contract 

performance of contract in New York, no personal jurisdiction would have lay simply from 

choice of venue/forum clause. 

Thus, constitutionally speaking, a forum-selection clause is insufficient to confer personal 

jurisdiction. Yet, here, that is all that is alleged. None of the parties, the transaction, the 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 8 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 9 of 14

performance or the breaches occurred in New York. Therefore, because a choice of venue clause 

is not enough, any decision requiring Oxysure to appear in New York would be a violation of 

due process and therefore, an invalid and unconstitutional exercise of jurisdiction over Oxysure. 

C. The Forum Selection Clause is Unenforceable 

Dismissal is also proper because the only contact is the forum selection clause, and that 

clause is unenforceable. The complaint itself alleged that the forum-selection clause reads as 

follows: 

ANY ACTION BROUGHT CONCERNING THE TRANSACTIONS 
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS WARRANT SHALL BE BROUGHT 
ONLY IN THE STATE OF COURTS OF NEW YORK OR IN THE 
FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK; 
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE HOLDER MAY CHOOSE TO 
WAIVE THIS PROVISION AND BRING AN ACTION OUTSIDE THE 
STATE OF NEW YORK.3 


The last clause renders the entire clause permissive and unenforceable. 

First, it has long been held that where one party is permitted to select any court it chooses 

and there has been no submission to a particular jurisdiction, then the entire clause is rendered 

permissive, and the non-filing party is not bound thereby. See, e.g. Congress Fin. Corp. v. 

Bortnick, No. 00 Civ. 6361, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15750, 2000 WL 1634248, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. 

Oct. 31, 2000) (declining to enforce forum selection clause that did not specify that plaintiff could 

force defendants to submit to its choice of forum); PowerDsine, Inc., 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 

6907, *10 (holding that lack of submission by the defendant to any jurisdiction selected by 

plaintiff rendered clause unenforceable). The fact that the clause here is augmented by a waiver 

of otherwise mandatory language cannot change the analysis. See id.; compare AGR Fin., L.L.C. 



3 See Complaint, ¶ 4. 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 9 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 10 of 14

v. Ready Staffing, Inc., 99 F.Supp.2d 399, 402 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (holding that express provision 

that defendant agreed to submit to the forum and jurisdiction of any forum selected by plaintiff 

did not render provision unenforceable). Read as a whole, as it must, the clause does not bind 

Oxysure. 

Second, the fact that clause unilaterally allows one party to waive and change the forum 

without notice renders it facially illusory and substantively unfair, and thus, unenforceable. See 

In re Zappos.com, Inc. Customer Data Sec. Breach Litig., 893 F. Supp. 2d 1058, 1065 (D. Nev. 

2012) (ability to unilaterally waive provision renders promise to arbitrate illusory and thus 

unenforceable); Grosvenor v. Qwest Corp., 854 F. Supp. 2d 1021, 1033-34 (D. Colo. 2012) 

(same); See Wagman v. Chater, No. 94 Civ. 7243 (DC), 1996 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5753, at *4 

(S.D.N.Y. May 1, 1996) (noting that, under New York law, an agreement that is illusory is not 

enforceable). While some cases have held that a notice requirement may save a unilateral 

provision from this fate, see, e.g., Bassett v. Elec. Arts, Inc., 93 F. Supp. 3d 95, 108 (E.D.N.Y. 

2015), this particular provision contains no notice requirement. 

Therefore, the forum-selection clause is, at best, dubiously enforceable. The fact that it 

allows the Plaintiffs to waive venue means that Oxysure has not agreed to have New York govern 

its contract litigation, and thus, there is no reason why New York would have jurisdiction over 

this case just because of the choice of venue clause. 

D. Without Jurisdiction This Court Must Dismiss this Suit 

Absent a showing that this Court has personal jurisdiction over Oxysure under the New 

York long-arm statute, this Court is obligated to dismiss this suit under Federal Rule of Civil 

Procedure 12(b)(2).

III. 

ALTERNATE MOTION TO DISMISS OR STAY IN FAVOR OF FIRST-FILED CASE 

A. This Court Should Yield to the First-Filed Case’s Determination of Venue 

Plaintiffs in this case are defendants in the Texas-filed action.4 The Texas filed action was 

filed on December 2, 2015,5 while this action was filed a week later. Indeed, Plaintiffs in this 

action have already raised the issue of venue before the Texas court and that matter will briefed 

before this Court’s decision thereon.6 

That the first-filed case should govern the proceedings is an uncontroversial proposition 

in this circuit. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Inc. v. Los Angeles County, 542 F. Supp. 1317, 

1320 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (“the accepted rule in this Circuit is that the forum where an action is filed 

first is accorded priority over subsequent actions arising out of the facts giving rise to the first 

filed action.”). The first-filed rule “requires the second filed New York action to be dismissed in 

favor of the first-filed action.” J. Lyons & Co. v. Republic of Tea, 892 F. Supp. 486, 490-91 

(S.D.N.Y. 1995). 

Courts in this circuit hold that the second filed case should be dismissed while the first-

filed court entertains motions about whether to dismiss or transfer the first-filed suit. See 

Donaldson, 542 F. Supp. at 1320 (dismissing second-filed action without prejudice because court 

of first-filing should determine whether to dismiss or transfer first-filed action); see also 

Meeropol v. Nizer, 505 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir. 1974) (“where an action is brought in one federal 



Docket Nos. 1-3.

Docket Nos. 1-3. 

6 See Oxysure Systems, Inc. v. Gemini Capital LLC et al., Cause No. 2015-cv-00821, Eastern District of Texas; 

Docket No. 5. 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay

district court and a later action embracing the same issue is brought in another federal court, the 

first court has jurisdiction to enjoin the prosecution of the second action.”) (citations omitted). 

The rationale is one of comity and judicial efficiency. See id. While the first-filed rule can be 

mitigated by showing that the first-filed case is merely a sham meant to secure venue in another 

jurisdiction, the allegations in the Texas case show that that is plainly not the case here. 

Thus, while the action in Texas is proceeding, this Court should dismiss this case awaiting 

the Texas decision on venue. 

B. The Texas Action is Logically and Legally Antecedent to the New York Action 

and Should Thus Be Allowed to Proceed First 


The Texas claims seek rescission of the contract due to fraud in the inducement and lack 

of a meeting of the minds and, and a declaration of its unenforceability—and thus do not depend 

on the construction or enforcement of the contract. If the Texas action goes forward successfully 

for Oxysure, then it will render the entirety of these proceedings moot because there will be no 

contract to enforce. 

Furthermore, there is little chance that the Texas claims fall under the forum selection 

clause invoked here and there, because they are antecedent to the contract issues. The action in 

Texas seeks rescission of the transactions and the agreements and seeks to declare the 

unenforceability on various grounds. Thus, as several courts have held, such actions are not 

subject to the choice of forum clause. See Altvater Gessler-J.A. Baczewski Int'l (USA) Inc. v. 

Sobieski Destylarnia S.A., 572 F.3d 86, 91 (2d Cir. 2009) (holding that tortious claims that 

predate contract formation do not invoke the contract’s choice of forum or venue clauses); 

Phillips v. Audio Active, Ltd., 494 F.3d 378, 389 (2d Cir. 2007). Where causes of action do not 

“depend on the construction of an agreement,” then they do not fall under a forum-selection 

Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative Stay 



Page 12 

Case 1:15-cv-09546-AT Document 15 Filed 01/04/16 Page 13 of 14

clause. See Phillips, 494 F.3d at 389 (holding that unlike arbitration clauses, forum selection 

clauses must be construed literally, not expansively because “the absence of a congressional 

policy on forum clauses prompting us to err on the side of coverage is significant”) (citing and 

distinguishing in part Omron Healthcare, Inc. v. Maclaren Exps. Ltd., 28 F.3d 600, 603 (7th Cir. 

1994)). 

C. This Court Should Dismiss this Action in Favor of the Texas Action, or Stay this 

Action Pending Resolution of the Texas Action 


Given the foregoing, this Court should dismiss the action before it in favor of the Texas 

Action. Donaldson, 542 F. Supp. at 1320. In the event that the Texas Court keeps the case, then 

this Court will not have wasted its time on duplicative efforts. If the Texas transfers the case to 

the Southern District of New York, then that case will proceed here and the claims in this case 

would, presumably, be brought as counterclaims. 

Alternatively, this Court could simply stay this case pending the outcome of the Texas 

action (be it dismissal, transfer or judgment), as any one of those will impact these proceedings 

materially. British Telecommunications plc v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 

6345, *11 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 1993) (staying second-filed action pending before it to allow court 

of first-filing "to proceed without fear of a conflicting order"); Ontel Prods. v. Project Strategies 

Corp., 899 F. Supp. 1144, 1150 n.9 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (observing that as first-filed court, it would 

determine venue and noting that second-filed court in New Jersey had abated pending the 

decision). 

Either way, this Court should accord due deference to the Texas Action.
