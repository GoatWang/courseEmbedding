For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedMichael Reisner does not have any conditions listed.

About Hans Michael Risner


I've read alot about this guy! Several different people have different dates for his birth.. but I think everybody agrees about the marriage dates.
Here is some cool info:
Sept 30, 1732 - Georg baer crossed the ocean with Michael (Hans).  When they arrived in Philadelphia, Baer was too sick to take his oaths at the Philadelphia Court House, and had to stay aboard the ship "Dragon".  He convened his land to Michael Reisner.  The land was Greenspring, and was surveyed, which without further explanation was patented on Feb 8, 1739, to Michael.
Michael owned two sections of land, Greensprings and Smiths Lot. These were located in what was called "Upper Germans" in Frederick county, MD.
Michael Reisner and Thomas Cresap, along with others settled on the west side of the Susquehanna River, and was claiming the land as Marylanders.  There was an attack on one their homes, led by the high sheriff of Lanchester County.  One man was carried as a prisoner the the Susquehanna River, in route to jail in Lanchester, but were met by five men, Michael Reisner being one of them. 
The exploits of Michael Reisner along with others in the border struggle between Maryland and Pennsylvania were several.  Michael Reisner was one of eight men arrested for activities in 1734, in the Canadochly area, west of the Susquehannah River.
April 28, 1734 Michael Reisner and wife Catarina, appear in the Lancaster Luthern Church Book as sponsors for a child, Sebastian Eberle.
In 1736, Michael Reisner was taken off to jail in Philadelphia, along with others.  Pennsylvania authorities claimed Reisner mistakenly shot and killed another member in his own group.  Reisner was perhaps the least likley to be intimidated or pushed to far by the Pennsylvanians, but for all his bellicosity, he too eventually retired to the backwoods above the monarchism, where Michael and others formed the nucleus of the german settlement in the northern reaches of Frederick Co MD.   
October 21, 1736 - The Governor issued a proclamation offering a reward of one hundred pounds each for several men, including Michael Reisner.
August 9, 1738 Michael Reisner had a 200 acre survey made in present day Carroll Co. near Silver Run.  It was called "Cat-Tail Marsh"  and was patented to him Feb 8, 1739, the same day he received the patent to Georg Baers "Green Spring".
March 13, 1742 - Michael Reisner conveyed "Cat-Tail Marsh" to Peter Youndblood and made "Green Springs" his home plantation.
1742 - The March Court fined Michael Reisner for assault on John Hussey.
1747 - Reisner was one of the signers of Paster Muhlenbergs Articles written into the Lutheran Church Book.
June 24, 1747 - Michael Reisner and Henrich H.S. Sechs signed their mark on Paster Muhlenbergs constitution for the Monocracy Luther Congregation and Evangelical Luthern of Frederick, Maryland. 
1750 - Michael Reisner was presented by the grand jury for beating John Youngblood.
Between 1750 and 1758 - Michael is taken to court about 8 more times, being sued for money that he owed others.  Plagued by debts, Michael Reisner petitioned the Maryland Assemble on June 20,1761 for release from debtors prison where he had languished for the past three years and four months.
1762 Reisner conveyed all his properties with value of 200 pounds to Samuel Beall Jr., who on Nov 21 1764 for 300 pounds sold Green Springs with its 200 acres, buildings, orchards, pastures, and fences to Conrod Licklighter (Lechlider).
1764 - It is doubtful that Reisners German neighbors had sufficient finances to have been of assistance to him.  His final fate is therefore unknown in Frederick Co MD, and further word of him is lacking.
It is believed that some of the Risners's fled from Strasburg Germany at the time of the Revocation in 1685.
