Philip Douglas Product Design













Auto Injector
Smaller, reusable and reliableThis is a personal project to redesign the EpiPen auto-injector. I was a nut allergy sufferer, for 18 years, so this was a relevant issue for me and I felt it appropriate to endeavour to improve this product which could use some thought and innovation. The device I designed reduces the overall size of the injector by folding in half, this also conceals the needle to reduce the risk of accidental injury. The epinephrine cartridge and needle are replacable by a chemist, avoiding human error and allowing the device to be reusable. 










GOkayak
Appearance model. Rugged GPS and one-touch recording.This was a university project, the brief asked me to design a piece of hardware specialised for a specific purpose and make an appearance model of the design. I identified the need for kayaking enthusiasts to keep track of where they are and the weather conditions easily, without having to fumble around with a paper map or the risk of getting their smartphone damaged due to water contact. Out of this the GOkayak was created, a device with a built in carabiner clip that allows the user to view maps and local weather information quickly and at any orientation thanks to a circular display. 










Boost cones
Daisy-chained, signal boosting cones.This was a concept imagined by a colleague at TTP while I was on placement there. The idea was to daisy chain specially designed traffic cones together to boost a signal's strength. This would help maintenance workers, or technicians, working in large, concrete buildings that would diminish signal strength for their equipment. This was a short project in which I designed an relevant, feasible concept in a period of 5 days. 










Central heating maintenance
Product family used for protecting central heating systems.The client on this project makes chemical products that are used to protect central heating systems from corrosion. I was required to design a collection of products that would allow the client to verify that their product had been used correctly in the installation of a domestic central heating system. The collection of products I designed includes a small display, that is connected to the boiler via a sensor dongle, and a connection module that allows the clients products to be inserted into the heating system. I was able to observe a technician, in a dummy house, drain and refill a central heating system, while correctly installing the clients products. This allowed me to understand the needs of the user in greater detail and design a more appropriate set of products. 










COPD Inhaler
Aesthetic re-brand for an existing device.This project was about creating a new identity for an existing product, without changing its internal components too much. The challenge was to create an aesthetic that was modern and clean and would help to update the user’s perception of the brand and product. The mechanical layout of the device was left the same with the cap being pulled upwards and rotated 90 degrees to prime the device, a flow actuated drug release system and the reverse action to close the cap. Keeping the same mechanical layout allowed us to reduce the cost of the proposal, while still giving the client a reason to re-design the product. 










Storage chair
Bookcase-inspired storage chair.This was a project I did myself before arriving at university. The motivation behind the idea was to be able to easily store the most frequently used living room items, within an arms reach, while maintaining a level of organisation.










Cell therapy
Product concept for specialised cell therapy processes.Cell therapy is a medical procedure currently in a period of rapid development in which the equipment used is being fast outpaced by the biology. This project brief was to design a piece of equipment that could move a liquid from one bag to another in a sterile manner, eliminating the two products currently being used to do the same job. This was achieved, by colleagues at TTP, using a tube welder and peristaltic pump, this is my product concept.  










Lampost Utility
Leasing lamppost power to third parties.The concept behind this mount is to create access points on existing streetlights that could be leased to third parties as power outlets. These could be used to power public wifi, parking cameras or any number of devices or services. I was asked to design the physical concept, I produced this in less than a week. 










PCB casing
Casing design optimised for size, to be as small as possible. While on my placement with TTP I was given the opportunity to take a design to completion, the whole way from ideation to production. The product was a wireless communications PCB that needed a housing. There were a set of requirements for the design of the housing, mainly that it had to open and allow for the PCB to be removed for testing. It also had to be as small as possible, not allow the PCB to move and come in two sizes. The final product and some of its development is show here.










Bosch Handrill
This was a university project that helped develop my advance surfacing skills. The brief was to pick an object that we could reengineer and surface model to optimise the design for additive manufacture. I chose a Bosch Hand drill and combined many of the casing parts into multiple material RP parts. A skeleton model was created first to define the major surfaces. Then individual parts were generated and thickened according the the design for additive manufacture. The project helped me gain an appreciation of higher level modelling strategies that enable continuous curvature surface structure. 










Virtual Queuing
Concept pair of devices for virtual queuing. This was a short project undertaken over the course of a couple of weeks. The brief was to create a virtual queuing concept that would convey the possibility of the technology to the clients. I designed a small palm-sized control unit that allows the user to select the desired rides, and timeslots, and a wrist worn device that would vibrate to alert the other users in the group when they were near the top of the queue. The main use-case is a parent controlling the rides and timeslots while the children wear the wrist unit to keep the parents up to date of the childrens location and status (i.e. on a ride/at a restaurant or not). 










Travel Dock
Promotional widget design and mould manufacture.This is a university project, we were given 28g of plastic and told to design a mould tool that would produce a promotional ‘widget’. The brand I chose was Skype and the design concept was composed of 3 components. A white platform that locks into the blue backplate to provide a smartphone mount and a white circle that secures in the backplate as detailing. Once we had designed individual 'widgets' we were split into groups where we had to pick our preferred design and then manufacture the mould and produce the widget. 










MyAuto
Worn by the patient to inject medicine over a prolonged period of time.This is a concept auto-injector device to be used for injecting small doses of medicine throughout the day. Due to the injection requirements of the medicine the device had to be designed so that it could be worn. I designed this concept to be stuck to the patient using an adhesive layer on the underside of the device, to be removed using the pull tab. This project spanned a month and went through a number of iterations before being presented to the client. 










Obi-Wan CANobi
Electro-Mechanical Can CrusherThis was a university project, in which we were split into groups of three and asked to design an electro-mechanical can crusher capable of dispensing and crushing five cans in a row. It had to be capable of crushing steel and aluminium cans in both 330mL and 440mL sizes. The group began by designing three separate can crushers and then chose the best features to go together to make the final design. This project helped develop my skills in designing novel mechanisms and doing hand calculations to verify a design's function. This content shows the design's progression through manufacture and testing.
