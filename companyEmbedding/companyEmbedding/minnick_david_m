Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

					COURT OF APPEALS DECISION DATED AND FILED June 10, 2015 Diane M. Fremgen Clerk of Court of Appeals Appeal No. NOTICE This opinion is subject to further editing. If published, the official version will appear in the bound volume of the Official Reports. A party may file with the Supreme Court a petition to review an adverse decision by the Court of Appeals. See WIS. STAT. § 808.10 and RULE 809.62. Cir. Ct. No. 2010CF1111 2014AP1504-CR STATE OF WISCONSIN IN COURT OF APPEALS DISTRICT II STATE OF WISCONSIN, PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT, V. DAVID M. MINNICK, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. APPEAL from a judgment and an order of the circuit court for Kenosha County: ANTHONY G. MILISAUSKAS, Judge. Affirmed. Before Neubauer, P.J., Reilly and Gundrum, JJ. ¶1 PER CURIAM. David M. Minnick received a sentence quadruple that which he claims defense counsel guaranteed he would get. He seeks to withdraw his no contest pleas because he contends they were induced by counsel’s ineffective assistance in making the alleged promises. He also asserts that the trial No. 2014AP1504-CR court’s credibility findings were clearly erroneous and that it erred by refusing to admit documentary evidence relevant to making accurate findings. We reject his contentions and affirm. ¶2 Upset that his wife planned to leave him, an intoxicated Minnick struck her on the head with a rifle butt and attempted to shoot her. She fled to her parents’ house down the street. Minnick followed, firing shots in the neighborhood. He then tried to break down the door of his in-laws’ house, broke windows, and shot inside their house, grazing his father-in-law. ¶3 Minnick was charged with aggravated battery, attempted first-degree intentional homicide, four counts of first-degree reckless endangerment, and attempted burglary, all by use of a dangerous weapon, and with endangering safety by reckless use of a firearm. The defense investigated a possible NGI plea due to Minnick’s diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. Ultimately he withdrew the NGI plea in favor of no contest pleas to all but the attempted first-degree intentional homicide charge. That count was dismissed and read in. ¶4 Even with the dismissal of the attempted homicide charge, consecutive sentences could have imprisoned Minnick for over a century. The court imposed a forty-one-year sentence: twenty-seven years’ initial confinement and fourteen years’ extended supervision. ¶5 Postconviction, Minnick sought plea withdrawal or resentencing. He asserted that his no contest pleas were not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary because they were entered in reliance on defense counsel’s assurances that he would get concurrent sentences totaling no more than ten years. The court denied Minnick’s motion. This appeal followed. 2 No. 2014AP1504-CR ¶6 A defendant’s post-sentencing effort to withdraw a guilty or no contest plea must prove a “manifest injustice” by clear and convincing evidence. State v. Negrete, 2012 WI 92, ¶16, 343 Wis. 2d 1, 819 N.W.2d 749. “The manifest-injustice test is satisfied if the defendant’s plea was the result of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.” State v. Hudson, 2013 WI App 120, ¶11, 351 Wis. 2d 73, 839 N.W.2d 147, review denied, 2014 WI 14, ___ Wis. 2d ___, 843 N.W.2d 707. To establish constitutional ineffectiveness, a defendant must show both deficient representation and resulting prejudice. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). We uphold a trial court’s factual findings unless clearly erroneous, but decide de novo the legal question of whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective. State v. Pitsch, 124 Wis. 2d 628, 634, 369 N.W.2d 711 (1985). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when “it is against the great weight and clear preponderance of the evidence.” State v. Arias, 2008 WI 84, ¶12, 311 Wis. 2d 358, 752 N.W.2d 748 (citation omitted). ¶7 Minnick and defense counsel Laura Walker testified at the postconviction hearing. Minnick testified that Walker assured him that if he pled no contest, he “would get five to seven years, absolutely no more than ten,” and that the sentencing judge “never, never issued a consecutive sentence.” He acknowledged, however, that Walker “would say, of course … I can’t say exactly” what the sentence would be and that he understood the sentence ultimately was up to the court. ¶8 Walker conceded that she told Minnick she believed he would be “looking [at] anywhere between six to ten years,” and “probably would get a concurrent sentence,” but denied telling him that the judge never ordered consecutive sentences. She also testified that she told Minnick “repeatedly” that 3 No. 2014AP1504-CR the disposition she believed likely was her opinion and that it “always had the caveat on the end that it’s ultimately up to the judge what’s going to happen.” ¶9 The trial court found Minnick’s testimony not credible and Walker’s credible. Deciding which witnesses are to be believed “is the exact function of the trier of fact.” State v. Christopher, 44 Wis. 2d 120, 127, 170 N.W.2d 803 (1969). Minnick contends that finding is clearly erroneous, however, because the court based it on a misinterpretation of his testimony and failed to consider the corroborating testimony of his friend, brother, and daughter, who all had spoken to Walker while Minnick was pondering whether to enter no contest pleas. ¶10 The allegedly misconstrued testimony was elicited when postconviction counsel was questioning Minnick about the events leading to the charges against him. Minnick confirmed that he did not dispute that “something very serious” had occurred that night. This exchange followed: Q. You’re not asserting that you weren’t there or that you didn’t pull the trigger or that— A. Q. —you weren’t drinking or any of that, correct? A. ¶11 No. No. Minnick contends that, as at other points in his testimony, in his nervousness he interrupted counsel’s single question with his “No” answer. The court found, however, that Minnick “lied under oath,” having told the arresting officers that he had drunk about eight twelve-ounce beers, and the fact that “the defendant under oath tells me he wasn’t drinking … goes to his credibility.” ¶12 Assuming without deciding that the court’s finding about Minnick’s testimony was clearly erroneous, the error was harmless. 4 The court made No. 2014AP1504-CR numerous other findings in regard to Minnick’s claim that he pled in reliance on Walker’s alleged promises. It found that Minnick had weeks to consider the plea offer, knew that the attempted first-degree intentional homicide charge—with the weapons enhancer, a sixty-five-year felony—would be read in for sentencing and that the presentence investigation report recommended all consecutive sentences totaling twenty-six and one-half years, and understood from the plea colloquy that the court could impose the maximum sentence on each count and that all sentences could be imposed consecutively. The record confirms these findings. ¶13 Minnick also contends the court failed to consider his supporters’ corroborating testimony. His friend testified that Walker “was very certain” that Minnick “would do five to seven with an absolute possibility of maybe ten” years and that there was “no way” consecutive sentences would be ordered, but he acknowledged he understood Walker was conveying her professional opinion. The brother testified that Walker told him Minnick’s sentence would be “something in the area of less than ten years but right around six and a half,” that she was “really careful in her wording not to make an all[-]out guarantee,” and, while “it was pretty clear that that’s what she was hinting at,” it was “somewhat an interpretation.” The daughter testified that Walker said she “was strongly believing” “the judge wouldn’t give [Minnick] any more than six years,” but that she also “told me it was her opinion.” The testimony of Minnick and his supporters does not establish that Walker gave unequivocal guarantees. ¶14 Minnick has shown no more than that counsel predicted an outcome that did not come to pass. Her misjudgment of the likely sentence is not a basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, see State v. Provo, 2004 WI App 97, ¶18, 272 Wis. 2d 837, 681 N.W.2d 272, and Minnick’s “disappointment in the 5 No. 2014AP1504-CR eventual punishment imposed is no ground for withdrawal of a guilty plea,” see State v. Booth, 142 Wis. 2d 232, 237, 418 N.W.2d 20 (Ct. App. 1987). ¶15 In a related argument, Minnick contends that the trial court erred by refusing to admit at the postconviction hearing documentary evidence relevant and necessary to a proper assessment of Walker’s credibility. The documents were an Office of Lawyer Regulation public reprimand Walker received in regard to her handling of this and other of Minnick’s cases and a criminal complaint alleging felony charges against her before she obtained her law license. He claims they would have shown Walker’s motivation to protect herself and her “willingness to act extremely when in conflict.” ¶16 The admission of evidence is left to the discretion of the trial court. State v. Jackson, 216 Wis. 2d 646, 655, 575 N.W.2d 475 (1998). We will not find an erroneous exercise of discretion where the trial court applied the facts of record to accepted legal standards. Id. ¶17 Walker served as power of attorney over Minnick’s finances while she represented him and was responsible for paying herself from his accounts. Minnick’s complaint to OLR arose from a fee dispute—Minnick claimed he owed Walker $13,000 in fees; she claimed it was $30,000—and the state of his accounts at the end of her representation. Walker was reprimanded for violating supreme court rules relating to fee agreements, her management and maintenance of the trust account and its records, notice and manner of withdrawals, and the failure to provide a full written accounting of the funds held in trust when her representation ended. Minnick argues that the OLR matter should have been admitted as it gave Walker a motive to protect herself through her postconviction testimony. 6 No. 2014AP1504-CR ¶18 We disagree. Consistent with Walker’s claim, OLR noted that her original flat rate increased to $30,000 when the scope of her representation expanded beyond the criminal matter. Walker acknowledged failing to amend the fee agreement or draft a new one and violating other ethical rules and consented to the reprimand. And while OLR stated that Minnick claimed about $19,000 was unaccounted for at the end, OLR did not make a finding that such was the case. As the State notes, evidence that OLR apparently believed Walker’s position is not relevant, as it would not have a tendency to make her credibility less probable, and thus not admissible. See WIS. STAT. §§ 904.01, 904.02 (2013-14).1 ¶19 Further, the statement about the allegedly misappropriated, or at least unaccounted-for, sums is double hearsay. To be admissible, each prong of hearsay within hearsay must conform with an exception to the hearsay rule. See WIS. STAT. § 908.05; State v. Kreuser, 91 Wis. 2d 242, 249, 280 N.W.2d 270 (1979). Neither does. ¶20 The OLR decision also was not admissible as other-acts evidence of Walker’s motive to testify falsely. Assessing the admissibility of such evidence requires the trial court to determine whether the evidence is offered for an acceptable purpose, is relevant, and its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion, or delay. State v. Sullivan, 216 Wis. 2d 768, 772-73, 576 N.W.2d 30 (1998). 1 All references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2013-14 version unless otherwise noted. 7 No. 2014AP1504-CR ¶21 While evidence of other bad acts is admissible to prove motive, WIS. STAT. § 904.04(2), the OLR decision is not relevant to prove that Walker misappropriated Minnick’s money. It simply did not make that finding. ¶22 Minnick also wanted admitted a copy of a five-count criminal complaint against Walker. She allegedly broke into the home of a love triangle competitor and choked and threatened to kill the person. Walker was convicted of one count of misdemeanor battery; the other counts were dismissed. The incident occurred before Walker was licensed to practice law. The complaint, Minnick contends, would have shown Walker’s “willingness to act extremely when in conflict,” even to the point of fabricating testimony. ¶23 The complaint was properly excluded. First, a complaint is not evidence and raises no inference of guilt. State v. Oppermann, 156 Wis. 2d 241, 246 n.2, 456 N.W.2d 625 (Ct. App. 1990); WIS JI—CRIMINAL 145. Beyond that, the five-year-old battery conviction would have been used to show that Walker was capable of perjury now because she acted badly in the past. That is classic, unduly prejudicial, “other-acts” propensity evidence that is irrelevant to a determination of credibility. See WIS. STAT. § 904.04(2)(a); see also State v. Clark, 179 Wis. 2d 484, 491, 507 N.W.2d 172 (Ct. App. 1993). ¶24 The record supports the trial court’s credibility findings and evidentiary rulings. We will not disturb them. By the Court.—Judgment and order affirmed. This opinion will not be RULE 809.23(1)(b)5. 8 published. See WIS. STAT.
