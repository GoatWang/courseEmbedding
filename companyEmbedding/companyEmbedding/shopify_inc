How Risky Is Shopify Inc. (U.S.) Stock?
It's less risky than you might think -- except for this one important variable.











                Brian Stoffel
            

                (TMFCheesehead)



            
            Jul 25, 2017 at 10:00AM
            
            





The story is pretty amazing: Snowboarder tries to start his own snowboard company; when he tries to build an e-commerce presence, there are no options he likes, so he makes his own; over time, that business outshines the snowboards; eventually the company is taken public.
In a nutshell, that's what happened to Tobias Lutke, founder and CEO of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). The company offers a subscription platform to help small and medium-sized businesses build sales channels across the Internet, as well as merchant services focused on payment and shipping solutions. Shares of the relatively young public company are up almost 400% since February 2016.
That has a lot of investors asking: How risky is this stock?

Risk and volatility are two different things: The first represents the chances you could lock in serious losses of capital, while the second has more to do with short-term fluctuations. As you'll see, I define risk over four different axes, and only on the last is Shopify truly a "risky" stock.
How strong is the moat?
By far the most important thing to evaluate from the perspective of risk is the strength of a company's moat -- or its sustainable competitive advantage. In Shopify, I believe we have a company with a very strong moat, in the form of high switching costs.
Imagine you start your website using Shopify's platform, and slowly and steadily you build a presence that brings in money for you. Moving to a different provider would involve a hefty sum of cash, retraining employees on a new system, and potential downtime for your customers. It is also a minefield for the "unknown unknown" headaches. Considering all that, what would it take for you to switch over to a competing platform?
So far, Shopify's roster of clients has shown no signs of slowing down.

Shopify's Strong MoatInfogram
Shopify is also the preferred platform for businesses trying to sell products on Facebook, Amazon.com, Pintrest, Twitter, and -- as of just recently -- eBay. Those are serious endorsements from some of the most powerful players in the world.
I don't see competition as a huge "risk" for investors at this point, though that could, of course, change over time.
Financial fortitude
The second risk worth investigating, especially for an unprofitable company like Shopify, is financial fortitude. The widest moat in the world won't matter if an economic downturn hits tomorrow and the company is forced to file for bankruptcy protection.
But after a recent stock offering, Shopify's balance, income, and cash flow sheets look very strong.

Data source: SEC filings. Net income and free cash flow presented on trailing-12-month basis.
While some might scoff that Shopify has "lost" $39 million over the past 12 months, I think it's a wise decision to continually spend slightly more than the company brings in.
Avoid Profitability & Grab Market ShareInfogram
That's because once the company is profitable, Wall Street will be clamoring for ever-higher figures. It's best for the company to grab as much market share as possible right now -- remember those high switching costs? -- and worry about profitability later. With almost $400 million in cash on the books, and having lost just over $6 million in free cash flow last year, Shopify can keep this trend going for a while.





Concentration risks
The third type of risk long-term investors should investigate is that which comes from relying on just a few customers for an outsize portion of sales. Referred to as "customer concentration risk," this situation makes a company fragile by putting itself at the whim of its clients -- where one unfavorable decision made one person at one company could doom investors.
While Shopify does have some big-name clients -- Tesla, Budweiser, and Red Bull  among them -- the chart from the first section shows that with over 300,000 clients, concentration risk is not a major concern.
Valuation risk
Finally, we have the one major risk that investors should be worried about: the stock's price.
Shopify's stock has doubled in 2017 alone. It currently has a market cap of almost $10 billion and trades for 22  times sales. To put that in perspective, Amazon -- itself still a growth story -- trades for 3.5 times sales. There are huge expectations baked into Shopify's stock, and if you can't stomach some gut-wrenching falls that can happen if the stock falls on the slightest whiff of unfavorable news, this isn't an investment for you.
That said, I think that is a short-term concern. Many of the world's greatest companies were considered "overvalued" during their nascent stages. Those who didn't buy shares paid the price. Yes, the stock will probably be volatile, and that requires a strong stomach and a long-term time horizon.
But if you have those two things, I believe the risks associated with Shopify are less than you might think. And my own skin is in the game" The company accounts for over 6% of my real-life holdings. You might want to consider it for your portfolio as well.

About
The first Shopify store was our own
It’s been our mission to make commerce better for everyone ever since








Nearly a decade ago we started an online
store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the
sport as much as us.
We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we
wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers,
along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it
for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need
of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify
was born.
We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can
focus on what they do best: building and selling their products.
Today, merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their
business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in
retail stores, and on the go.













                400,000
              
Active Shopify stores



                $34 Billion
              
Worth of sales








We've grown a lot since we started Shopify in 2006.
From a team of 5 working out of a local coffee shop, to a team of over
2,000 working in 5 offices across North America. We’re
really proud of our success and growth and we’ve worked hard to
nurture our company values and culture. We encourage everyone to
experiment, take risks, and push the envelope.











The opportunity to shape how retail works is in our hands.
Over the coming years, the way purchasing works will change at a
fundamental level. Customers will expect options of where and how to
buy: in-store or online, delivered or for pick-up. It’s an incredibly
exciting time for this industry, and we’re going to be right at the
centre of it.








  
Career opportunities
We’re growing, and we’re looking for talented people who can make commerce better.

About
The first Shopify store was our own
It’s been our mission to make commerce better for everyone ever since








Nearly a decade ago we started an online
store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the
sport as much as us.
We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we
wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers,
along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it
for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need
of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify
was born.
We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can
focus on what they do best: building and selling their products.
Today, merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their
business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in
retail stores, and on the go.

Worth of sales








We've grown a lot since we started Shopify in 2006.
From a team of 5 working out of a local coffee shop, to a team of over
2,000 working in 5 offices across North America. We’re
really proud of our success and growth and we’ve worked hard to
nurture our company values and culture. We encourage everyone to
experiment, take risks, and push the envelope.











The opportunity to shape how retail works is in our hands.
Over the coming years, the way purchasing works will change at a
fundamental level. Customers will expect options of where and how to
buy: in-store or online, delivered or for pick-up. It’s an incredibly
exciting time for this industry, and we’re going to be right at the
centre of it.








  
Career opportunities
We’re growing, and we’re looking for talented people who can make commerce better.

Frequently Asked Questions





            General questions
          



Is there a setup fee?
No. There are no setup fees on any of our plans.

 
Do I need to enter my credit card details to sign up?
No. You can sign up and use Shopify for 14 days without entering your credit card details. At the end of your trial, or when you decide to launch your store, you will need to pick a plan and enter your credit card details.

 
Can I cancel my account at any time?
Yes. If you ever decide that Shopify isn’t the best ecommerce platform for your business, simply cancel your account.

 
How long are your contracts?
All Shopify plans are month to month unless you sign up for an annual or biennial plan.

 
Do you offer any discounted plans?
Yes, we offer a 10% discount on annual plans and a 20% discount on biennial plans, when they are paid upfront.

 
Can I change my plan later on?
Absolutely! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time.

 
Is Shopify PCI Compliant or PCI Certified?
Yes. Shopify is certified Level 1 PCI DSS compliant. This means all your data and customer information is ultra secure.

 
Do I have to sell the same products in-store as I do online?
No, you can choose exactly what products to sell online, in-store, or both.

 
What is the rate if I type in a credit card?
If you chose to type in a credit card number instead of using the Shopify credit card reader, you will be charged the same rate as your online rate.



Are there any transaction fees?
Use Shopify Payments and pay no transaction fee. If you choose an
external payment gateway, there will be additional fees of 2%, 1% or
0.5% for our Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify plans,
respectively.

 






            Online questions
          



Can I use my own domain name?
Yes. You can purchase a domain name within Shopify, or use an existing one that you own. We also provide a free myshopify.com domain name to all stores on sign up.



What are your bandwidth fees?
There are none. All Shopify plans include unlimited bandwidth for free.



Do I need a web host?
Shopify includes secure, unlimited ecommerce hosting on all plans except Shopify Lite. You can also use the Buy Button to add ecommerce to any existing website.

 




              POS questions
            



What does Shopify POS do?
Shopify POS is an application for iOS and Android devices that you can
use for transactions in a physical store or pop-up setting. Find
products, process orders, take payment, swipe credit cards, produce
receipts, and control it all from your iPad or mobile device. All the
background management of your store is done from your Shopify admin,
which you can access using any browser.



Can I merge my Shopify online store with Shopify POS?
Yes. Your Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify
POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Product or
inventory updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly
take effect in Shopify POS.



Can I use Shopify POS if I have multiple cash registers in use at the same time?
Yes. You can install Shopify POS on multiple devices, and you won’t be
charged any extra. Store activity on all devices is synchronized with
your Shopify admin.



Can I use Shopify POS if I’m outside the United States/Canada?
The Shopify POS app is available worldwide. There are just two
important considerations:

You'll have to buy the supported hardware through an external
retailer.
You'll have to use an external credit card terminal to
accept credit cards.




Where can I buy a cash register, receipt printer, and other hardware?
You can buy hardware kits and individual items of supported hardware from the Shopify
Hardware Store in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the continental United States. Outside of
these countries, supported hardware is available from authorized
resellers.
