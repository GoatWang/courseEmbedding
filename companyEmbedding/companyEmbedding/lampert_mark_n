Mark Lampert to retire from Daimler Trucks NA



Daimler veteran Richard Howard named to succeed Lampert

Mark Lampert, who will soon retire from DTNA.

Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA) has announced that Mark Lampert, senior vice president of sales & marketing for the  OEM, will retire on March 31st. According to DTNA, during his tenure, Lampert was responsible for the development of sales and marketing for Freightliner Trucks and the Detroit brand of on-highway engines, axles and transmissions as well as the manufacturer's proprietary components sales. Additionally, he had oversight of the company’s used truck operations and its export sales. Lampert joined the company in 1993 as vice president of sales for Freightliner Canada. From there, he held positions of increasing responsibility, including managing the company’s dealer operations, product planning, marketing, retail truck operations and used trucks. “I am extremely grateful to have spent over 20 years with this great company, and I am deeply honored to have had the opportunity to lead Freightliner to its present position as undisputed market leader across each and every commercial vehicle segment,” said Lampert. “Working for Daimler Trucks North America has been a blessing and a privilege; however, I am resolute that 2014 is the right time for me to retire for a variety of reasons," he continued. "First, the company’s future sales success is assured through a robust product pipeline, as well as the Freightliner Cascadia Evolution– the industry’s flagship in terms of total cost of ownership.  Second, I look forward to spending more time with my wife, children and grandchildren.  And lastly, the company has identified an excellent successor, Richard Howard, who is capable of executing the company’s sales and marketing vision well into the future.” “Daimler Trucks North America owes a huge debt of gratitude for Mark’s unwavering commitment to sales and marketing excellence," remarked Martin Daum, president & CEO. "His goal of achieving undisputed market leadership is unquestioned as he leaves the company’s sales and marketing team positioned for continued prosperity. “Mark’s retirement is well-earned and his career will be unmatched in our industry," Daum added. "We will always consider him a valued member of the Daimler Trucks North America family and wish him the best for his retirement.  I look forward to continuing my close personal relationship with Mark and will remain a supportive confidant and trusted friend throughout his future endeavors.” Succeeding Lampert will be Richard Howard. Howard, who will begin his new position on April 1, was formerly a member of the board of management of Daimler Financial Services AG, responsible for the Africa & Asia/Pacific region. He has over 20 years of management experience. Howard has held a number of positions with Daimler, including project management, marketing and financial services posts in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, the United States and in the Asia-Pacific region.   Additionally, prior to his current assignment in Asia, he was vice president of Daimler Truck Financial USA with specific responsibility to support DTNA's sales and dealer network. “Richard’s oversight of Daimler Truck Financial USA through the last economic downturn forged strong ties with Daimler Trucks North America’s customers and dealer network,” said Daum. “His decisive leadership, his personal style, and his depth of experience across the entire Daimler organization exemplify the skills and values required for exceptional leadership.” “I am excited by this opportunity to lead the Daimler Trucks North America sales and marketing group," said Howard. "We have an outstanding team and I applaud Mark Lampert’s performance pacing the industry in each and every vehicle segment. "I look forward to furthering the expectations of each and every customer through our industry-leading products and customer support,” added Howard.

Biotech Firm to Liquidate Under Investor’s Pressure

By ANDREW POLLACKMARCH 27, 2009

Score one for the biotech liquidators.Avigen,  a biotechnology company, is preparing to liquidate itself and return its remaining cash to shareholders. The company was pressed to do so by its largest holder, the Biotechnology Value Fund.The company, whose most promising drug candidate failed in a clinical trial in October, is one of several biotech businesses that have been under pressure from investors recently to liquidate after a setback.In the past, when one of its drugs  failed, a biotechnology company  typically moved to a new drug. But with capital markets tight, investors are becoming less patient with that tradition and are trying to pull the plug on unsuccessful companies.Avigen, based in Alameda, Calif., had been resisting the efforts of the Biotechnology Value Fund, which started a proxy fight to replace the company’s board.

But on Thursday, Avigen gave in, saying it would liquidate  — as long as  the Biotechnology Value Fund  nominees were not elected to the board. At the same time, the company, saying it had no more business to pursue, dismissed most of its employees, including Kenneth G. Chahine, the chief executive. Continue reading the main story

On Friday about 58 percent of the company’s shares, including the nearly 30 percent owned by Biotechnology Value Fund, voted to remove Avigen’s board. Because that was short of the two-thirds vote needed, the board will stay in place. But the fund is nonetheless getting the liquidation it sought.

“This is a great day for stockholder democracy,” Mark N. Lampert, the president of Biotechnology Value Fund, said  Friday. “Avigen’s remaining capital will not be squandered but, instead, will be returned to stockholders so that each may decide how best to utilize their capital.”  He said his fund would invest the proceeds in other cash-starved biotech companies.It was also a great day for Biotechnology Value Fund, which  doubled its investment  in Avigen in a few months.After Avigen’s  drug, which was intended  to treat a symptom of multiple sclerosis, failed in the clinical trial, the fund bought nearly nine million shares of the company at about 58 cents a share. It now stands to get at least $1.20 a share from the liquidation,  Avigen estimates.Avigen closed Friday at $1.23 a share, up 5 cents.Mr. Chahine said in an interview that Avigen had received seven proposals for a merger, some of which might have provided a greater return over the long run than liquidation. But he said proceeding with merger negotiations would have been difficult without the support of the Biotechnology Value Fund.“I can’t say it was a victory for either party,” he said.
