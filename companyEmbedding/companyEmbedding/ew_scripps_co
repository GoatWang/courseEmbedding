Vision
We create a better-informed world.

Mission
We do well by doing good - creating value for customers, employees and owners by informing, engaging and empowering those we serve.

Motto (since 1922)
Give light and the people will find their own way.


Scripps is a company where competing truths coexist.
We are proud of our long and rich history, but we stay fixated on the future.
We are creating digital media brands that complement and support our successful television and radio stations but also some that could compete with and disrupt them.
We employ accomplished journalists who have earned prestigious industry awards and have authority with audiences. But weâre also a band of contrarians who challenge the process and push ourselves to do new things.
We are obsessed with being right, but weâre not afraid to experiment and, occasionally, to fail.
We have a conservative financial ethos, but we use it to support an opportunistic and, at times, counterintuitive investing strategy.
We were birthed by newspapers, and we nurtured cable systems and cable networks. We loved them all, but we set them free.
We are comfortable with these kinds of disruptive ideas and contradictory facts. And that leads to a culture where our thriving broadcast business works side by side with emerging digital brands. Together these businesses create a financially attractive news and information company whose employees want to improve the circumstances of those we serve.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers – Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)
Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)
Kitsap Sun (Bremerton, Washington)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

A step ahead of tomorrow | The E.W. Scripps Company



























Digital





A step ahead of tomorrow

The Digital team is a little bit obsessed with building brands around how people get their news today as well as anticipating how they will get it tomorrow. 
The several hundred people who make up this team spend their time designing digital brands, investigating emerging news brands and new behaviors, and supporting the digital products of our television and radio stations. They know they must understand how today’s consumers are seeking out and engaging with news and entertainment content. 
We can all see that this behavior is changing -- from paging through a newspaper and flipping on the 6 o’clock news to swiping a news notification or listening to a podcast. 
In order to help Scripps change along with – and maybe a little ahead of – its audiences, those in the Scripps Digital group are tasked with a number of jobs: operating as an incubator of new product ideas, being a resource that supports and provides direction to our stations’ local markets, and acting as an investor who is constantly searching for new opportunities. 
This group owns strategy and also execution of digital content, sales and revenue results as well as product development and marketing.
It’s a big job, and the company is counting on their success.









We’re seeking creative, curious and collegial salespeople and marketers, designers and developers, writers and strategists.

Newsy - news with the why (:55)





Partnerships & Acquisition

Build it or buy it. That could be the motto of the Digital Solutions Group -- if they slowed down long enough to choose a motto. This group inside Scripps Digital is building digital businesses to fix problems that haven’t been solved and buying businesses where someone else found the opportunity first. They are driving hard to either buy or build what Michael Lewis famously called “the new new thing”, fueled by entrepreneurial spirit, a company culture of experimentation and energy drinks.







Newsy



Newsy is an award-winning millennial-focused over-the-top video news service that provides “news with the why” through platforms including SlingTV, Apple TV, Watchable from Comcast, Amazon Fire and Roku, among others.
Here is a video explanation.




Midroll Media



Midroll is the leading podcast company, producing dozens of original shows and representing more than 250 in an ad network that connects brands to some of the most beloved and respected names in podcasting. Sample popular shows such as Comedy Bang Bang, The Longest Shortest Time and The David Gregory Show.  




Cracked



Cracked is a humor and satire brand that informs and entertains millennial audiences through a high-traffic website, mobile apps, original digital video, social media and a popular podcast. 
Check it out. 




Local market sites/apps



In dozens of TV and radio markets across the country, Scripps stations provide news, information and streaming video across all of their news apps and websites. Each local TV market also has a Roku channel to provide video content and live coverage. 




StormShield



Scripps’ StormShield turns any iPhone or Android into an emergency weather radio. The app provides storm-based alerts for winter storm season, tornado, hurricane, flood, thunderstorm and other life-threatening weather events via voice and push notifications. In Scripps markets, local meteorologists also provide life-saving severe weather coverage.




Simplemost



People’s lives are busier and busier these days. The goal of Simplemost is to provide women with ideas and tips to help make things just a little easier. From money-saving advice to quick and easy recipes to stories about the good in the world, Simplemost is focused on creating interesting stories that delight our readers. 








Owning Local Markets
WCPO Insider: Strong journalism + rewards from local businesses = community 
At WCPO.com in Cincinnati, a growing number of “Insiders” pay a monthly subscription fee to gain access to premium content -- long-form storytelling, investigative reporting, and explanatory journalism. 
In addition, WCPO Insiders receive a concierge-like membership that helps them live a more locally-connected life. We combine great local content with deals from loved local businesses that convey a sense of Cincinnati to those who love the city. WCPO.com not only tells Insiders what they need to know about the communities but makes them feel more a part of those communities.

The E.W. Scripps Co. announced a leadership change Wednesday. CEO Rich Boehne named Chief Digital Officer Adam Symson as his successor.Boehne plans to retire in the second half of 2017. Symson has been promoted to chief operating officer.“Adam is a strong leader and an entrepreneurial thinker,” Boehne said in a message to Scripps employees. The 41-year-old Symson is “exactly the right person to lead this company into the challenging and complex opportunities ahead of us.”Boehne, 60, has been president and CEO since 2008 and was elected chairman of the board in 2013. The board anticipates Boehne will continue as its chairman following the transition later next year.Symson, 41, joined the Scripps TV division in 2002 and has held a variety of roles before taking over the company’s digital operations in 2011.In that role, he has run Scripps’ local digital businesses in 27 markets as well as national digital content companies Midroll, Newsy and Cracked. Scripps’ digital portfolio includes web, mobile and over-the-top businesses, and Symson has led the strategy and execution of product development, content, revenue and marketing for that portfolio. He also has led the company’s efforts to develop new businesses in emerging media through investment and acquisition.Symson calls it the “opportunity of a lifetime” to be able to lead a company with “a long history of excellence in journalism.”But it’s not a job he ever expected.“The goals I set for myself in my career long ago sort of ended at the point where I said I wanted to be an investigative journalist,” he said. “That’s about as far as I had planned.”Symson joined Scripps as executive producer of investigations and special projects for Scripps affiliate KNXV in Phoenix in 2002. He also has worked for CBS stations WBBM in Chicago and KCBS in Los Angeles and as an independent producer for CBS News and NBC News.“For me, the reason I’m comfortable with where I have gone is because it’s been within Scripps, a company that’s very focused on the right kind of journalism that can make an impact on the communities where we operate,” he said.Symson said Scripps will continue to pursue the strategies Boehne established in the last several years, adding different media platforms to the television stations that account for more than 80 percent of the company’s revenue.He said Boehne’s legacy at Scripps will be its 20-year evolution from a newspaper company with broadcast and cable properties to a portfolio company with TV, radio, podcasting and direct-to-consumer content platforms that keep consumers engaged and journalism alive in local media markets.“Those are big shoes to fill,” Symson said. “Rich has elegantly managed this company through a number of major transitions, while deftly keeping the focus on journalism and our core mission, returning value to shareholders and growing a very important relationship with the Scripps family.”

Scripps Company full-time (Less than a year)ProsThe management at the location I work for is unsurpassed - the stations continue to be leaders in our market and recognized nationally... This is due in big part to the program directors, on-air staff, sales, promotions and management working collaboratively and keeping the community and our listeners a #1 priority always. As a whole, Scripps corporate is open to ideas, seeking contributions from their team members, and highly invested in developing the talent of their employees. Always looking to grow, and be one step ahead - a company I am proud to be a part of.ConsSome of the training programs are a "one or two only" from each location. I understand expense of the training is likely a large factor in this, but if you have 5 legitimately hungry-for-training staff that are clearly desiring to better their career for themselves and the company, why not make that investment?Advice to Managementas noted in consShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) The E.W.

During the time I worked there management was busy cutting the budget to kill the goose that was laying the golden egg. They basically cut the heart out of the product that attracted readers. There was also ongoing pressure to work unpaid overtime and even pressure to turn in falsified timesheets that did not show overtime.Advice to ManagementFigure out what is essential and what is not.

Scripps Company full-time (More than 5 years)ProsIt's relatively easy to get in. A lot of people I know either start right out of college, or in my case, have relevant job experience and no college degree. The work is interesting and will definitely get you ready to work in larger markets. There are lots of jobs within Scripps that you'll get preferential treatment for if you want to apply and move up and on.ConsPay is stagnant. Raises are rare without changing job titles, positions, or titles. If you're willing to bide your time and move around you can move up. Be clear with what you want with your boss from the very beginning to get set on a good path. Even then, sometimes you'll have to wait years before moving up at all. Scripps corporate seems to care but local management works their people into the dirt. No preference for people that are there for promotions. Lots of outside hiring when there are many good candidates internally (this is a specific manager)Advice to ManagementLook within for good talent. Don't overlook the people that have put in the time. Ask and mentor the younger employees on what their goals are and help them reach them. Numbers aren't everything. Remember that story-telling and not ambulance chasing is how you bring people in.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)
Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)

World Journal Tribune
Known as the New York World-Telegram and Sun after 1951, when it purchased the remnants of the New York Sun. After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)
Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)
Kitsap Sun (Bremerton, Washington)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

The Washington Post seems fine, but recently, in just over a week, three of the biggest players in American newspapers – Gannett, Tribune Company and E. W. Scripps, companies built on print franchises that expanded into television – dumped those properties like yesterday's news in a series of spinoffs.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)
Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)
Kitsap Sun (Bremerton, Washington)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)
Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)
Kitsap Sun (Bremerton, Washington)

World Journal Tribune
Known as the New York World-Telegram and Sun after 1951, when it purchased the remnants of the New York Sun. After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Founded in 1899. Also had its roots in what was one of the first newspapers in Ohio, The Ohio State Journal, which was founded in 1814. Operated as part of a joint operating agreement with The Columbus Dispatch for several decades; Scripps folded the paper after the Dispatch terminated the JOA, and a sale of the paper to Akron-area businessman Nyles V. Reinfeld collapsed.

Founded 1903. Merged with the Hearst's San Francisco Call-Bulletin to form The News-Call Bulletin in 1959. Hearst acquired complete control in 1962 and merged it into the San Francisco Examiner in 1965.


Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

Hear our employees talk about their careers at Scripps













        Culture
      


To our viewing audience, we’re primped and polished. When the “on air” light goes off, we’re much more comfortable being casual. Scripps is a place where creativity has taken over. We dress up when we need to, dress down when we can and always maintain professionalism. For the most part, Scripps is focused on creating great work, and great work comes from people who love what they do. 













        Benefits
      


Scripps provides the resources to help you maintain stability in your life. We want you to be able to focus on doing amazing things with us. That’s why you’ll find benefits that put your mind at ease — everything from medical insurance and retirement planning to adoption assistance and tuition reimbursement. 













        Professional Development
      


As Scripps has grown, so too have the opportunities. We’re offering jobs in cities all across the country where competition is stiff and our reputation helps us to attract the very best. One of the draws is every employee has access to invaluable professional development. This includes online learning, leadership training and opportunities for industry conferences.  













        Community Outreach
      


Community-focused storytelling is our passion, and the stories most important to our success are those lived every day by our employees. They give their time and energy to volunteer at community nonprofits or serve on boards. Our stations rally for annual events such as toy and food drives. Some broadcast telethons to benefit first responders while others take a stand against domestic violence. Our employees also leverage the generosity of the Scripps Howard Foundation for grants that empower each employee to contribute to their community in a way that is personal and meaningful.

Original Programming
Rather than continue down the same path of renting programming from syndicators, Scripps has returned to its roots of content creation. Its first effort, to replace Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy with original shows, raised some eyebrows. But a foundation as content creators coupled with a certain amount of risk tolerance positioned Scripps to enjoy the rewards of building shows that are growing in popularity on a local and national scale. 





The List
The List is the Emmy Award-winning show featuring everything trending in social media in the form of a list. It is hosted by Kristina Guerrero, Donna Ruko and Jared Cotter. The List Weekend show includes host Teresa Strasser. There’s the news and then there’s The List.
The List is in its fifth season and is available in 45 markets, eight in the Nielsen Top 20. The show is airing across the day on ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX affiliates. 
The List content is available on multiple platforms through its broadcast production; its digital channel on OWNZONES.com; on the video network Gas Station TV; its website; and its mobile app, available for free download for iOS and Android devices.
Watch video



The NOW
The Now is a fast-moving locally produced program that covers news trending on social media and invites the audience to join the conversation across traditional and digital media platforms. The hourlong program features a mix of local, national and international news as well as viral stories, videos, entertainment and lifestyle stories.



RightThisMinute
RightThisMinute is the viral videos show – now seen in more than 90 percent of the U.S. on America’s best TV stations. We have the stories behind these web videos with interviews and information you won’t find anywhere else. If it’s funny, outrageous, informative or entertaining, you’ll see it here first.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (December 2014)


The E. W. Scripps Company was incorporated on December 1, 1987,[3] but it traces its history to November 2, 1878, when Edward Willis Scripps published the first issue of the Cleveland Penny Press.
In 1894, E. W. Scripps and his half-brother, George H. Scripps, organized their various papers into the first modern newspaper chain. In July 1895, it was named the Scripps-McRae League with the addition of Cincinnati Post general manager Milton A. McRae as a partner.[4] On November 29, 1921, it was renamed Scripps-Howard Newspapers, to recognize Roy W. Howard.[5]
On November 23, 1922, the company was placed in trust for E. W. Scripps' children and grandchildren.[5] The company's shares were divided into two types: Class A Common Shares, which were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and common voting shares, which were not publicly traded and elected a majority of the company's directors. A number of media companies, including the New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, are governed by this system so that the descendants of the company's founders can keep control of the company.[6]




The E. W. Scripps Company is headquartered in the Scripps Center in downtown Cincinnati.


In 1990, the company completed a new downtown Cincinnati headquarters, the Scripps Center.[7]
On October 16, 2007, the company announced that it would separate into two publicly traded companies: The E. W. Scripps Company (newspapers, TV stations, licensing/syndication) and Scripps Networks Interactive (NYSE: SNI), (HGTV, Food Network, DIY Network, Cooking Channel (formerly known as Fine Living), Travel Channel and Great American Country). The transaction was completed on July 1, 2008.
On October 3, 2011, The E. W. Scripps Company announced it was purchasing the television arm of McGraw-Hill for $212 million.[8] This purchase nearly doubles the number of Scripps stations to 19 with a combined reach of 13% of U.S. households. Upon the 2012 death of E. W. Scripps' grandson, Robert Scripps, the Edward W. Scripps Trust was dissolved and its stock divided among the surviving trustees.[6]
The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications announced on July 30, 2014, that the two companies would merge and spin-off their newspaper assets.[9] The deal created a broadcast group under the E.W. Scripps Company name and retaining the Cincinnati headquarters, and a newspaper company based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, under the Journal Media Group name.[10] The FCC approved the deal on December 12, 2014, and it was approved by shareholders on March 11, 2015.[11] The merger and spinoff were completed on April 1, 2015.[12][13] Journal Media Group merged with the all-newspaper Gannett Company on April 8, 2016. Gannett had also shed their television and broadcast operations into a spin-off, Tegna, months after the Scripps-Journal merger.
In April 2016, Demand Media announced the sale of the humor/listicle website Cracked.com to E.W. Scripps.[14]In June, it acquired podcast service Stitcher from Deezer[15]
Scripps newspapers[edit]
In 1997, Scripps bought daily Texas newspapers in Corpus Christi, Abilene, Wichita Falls, San Angelo and Plano, plus the paper in Anderson, S.C. from Harte-Hanks Communications, along with 25 non-daily newspapers and San Antonio-based KENS-TV and KENS-AM.[16] The purchase price was to be between $605 and $775 million, depending on a federal ruling.[17]
The company, before the merger with Journal and creation of spinoff, owned and operated newspapers in 13 American markets:

Ventura County Star (Camarillo, California)
Redding Record Searchlight (Redding, California)
Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida)
Treasure Coast Newspapers:

The Stuart News (Stuart, Florida)
Indian River Press Journal (Vero Beach, Florida)
The St. Lucie News-Tribune (Fort Pierce, Florida)
The Jupiter Courier (weekly; Jupiter, Florida)


Evansville Courier & Press (Evansville, Indiana)
The Gleaner (Henderson, Kentucky)
The Anderson Independent-Mail (Anderson, South Carolina)
The Knoxville News-Sentinel (Knoxville, Tennessee)
The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee)
The Abilene Reporter-News (Abilene, Texas)
Corpus Christi Caller Times (Corpus Christi, Texas)
San Angelo Standard-Times (San Angelo, Texas)
Times Record News (Wichita Falls, Texas)
Kitsap Sun (Bremerton, Washington)

After a proposed joint operating agreement between two other newspapers with distinct histories – Hearst's New York Journal American and John Hay Whitney's New York Herald Tribune – collapsed due to union pressure, all three merged to form the New York World Journal Tribune (all three owners had a stake in the publication as "World Journal Tribune, Inc."). The combined paper did not launch for 140 days due to a newspaper strike triggered by the merger, and ultimately folded the following May. Scripps would maintain ownership of the World-Telegram's annual publication, The World Almanac and Book of Facts until 1993, when that was sold to Primedia.

Syndicates[edit]
Scripps operated United Media (composed of the United Feature Syndicate and the Newspaper Enterprise Association). United Feature Syndicate syndicated many notable comic strips including Peanuts, Garfield, Li'l Abner, Dilbert, Nancy and Marmaduke. NEA, originally established as a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service, later evolved into a general syndicate, and were best known for syndicating Alley Oop, Freckles and His Friends, The Born Loser and Frank and Ernest, in addition to an annual Christmas comic strip.[18] The distribution rights to properties syndicated by United Media was outsourced to Universal Uclick in February 2011. While United Media effectively ceased to exist, Scripps still maintains copyrights and intellectual property rights.[19][20]
Scripps also operated United Press International (United Press from its 1907 inception until a 1958 merger with Hearst's International News Service) until selling it off in 1982. It also previously owned the Scripps Howard News Service, which shut down in 2013.[21]
Broadcasting[edit]
E. W. Scripps' television division currently owns thirty-three television stations in twenty-four markets; fifteen ABC affiliates, five NBC affiliates, five Azteca América affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, two CBS affiliates, two Fox affiliates, one CW affiliate, and one independent affiliate. As a result of its merger with Journal, the company will also retain Journal's radio station group for the time being, along with maintaining the sports play-by-play radio networks for Journal's major broadcasting rights in Wisconsin; the Green Bay Packers Radio Network, and the Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network.
Scripps also previously owned the Shop at Home Network from 2000 until 2006. Shop at Home in turn owned five television stations, all as a division of its cable network division.
In October 1995, Comcast announced the purchase of E. W. Scripps' cable provider operation.[22]
Attempts to use Shop at Home as a complementary service to Food Network and HGTV by selling products connected to personalities of those networks were middling compared to competitors QVC and HSN. On May 22, 2006, Scripps announced that it was to cease operations of the network and intended to sell each of Shop at Home's five owned and operated television stations.[23] Jewelry Television eventually acquired Shop at Home, but Scripps still intended to sell its affiliated stations (Jewelry Television discontinued most Shop at Home operations in March 2008). On September 26, 2006, Scripps announced that it was selling its Shop at Home TV stations to New York City-based Multicultural Television for $170 million.[24]
On October 3, 2011, Scripps announced it was purchasing all seven television stations owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies for $212 million; the sale is a result of McGraw-Hill's decision to exit the broadcasting industry to focus on its other core properties, including its publishing unit.[25] This deal was approved by the FTC on October 31[26] and the FCC on November 29.[27] The deal was completed on December 30, 2011.[28]
On February 10, 2014, Scripps announced it has reached a deal to acquire Buffalo ABC affiliate WKBW-TV and Detroit MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYD for $110 million.[29] The sale was approved by the FCC on May 2, 2014 and was completed on June 16, 2014. This deal has created a duopoly between WMYD and ABC affiliate WXYZ-TV.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 06/01/1975
            

                BBB has determined that E W Scripps Co meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means:

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
