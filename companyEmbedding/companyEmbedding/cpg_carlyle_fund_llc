Private equity giant Carlyle Group is shutting down the two mutual funds it launched just a year ago

  (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP has decided to liquidate the two
  mutual funds it launched last year, regulatory filings showed
  this week, as the private equity firm seeks other ways to gain
  more traction with so-called liquid alternative funds.


  Developing mutual funds has historically been challenging for
  private equity firms because the average buyout fund is illiquid,
  with a typical life span of 10 years. But as these firms
  diversified into relatively more liquid alternative assets, such
  as credit and hedge funds, they have sought to widen their base
  beyond institutional investors.


  Next month, Carlyle will close Carlyle Global Core Allocation
  Fund, which has $50 million in net assets with a mandate to
  invest across equities, debt, real estate, commodities and
  currencies using exchange-traded funds, according to a filing
  with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.


  Carlyle Enhanced Commodity Real Return Fund, which had a mandate
  to invest in asset classes such as energy and metals, but never
  took off, will also be wound down, according to a second filing.


  The move leaves Carlyle with Diversified Global Asset Management
  Corp (DGAM), a funds-of-hedge-funds manager it acquired in
  February 2014, as its main platform for launching liquid
  alternative products.

  DGAM has developed a number of liquid alternative funds aimed
  primarily at institutional investors, rather than the retail
  investors who invest in mutual funds.


  Some of these DGAM alternative funds could be marketed soon,
  according to a person with knowledge of Carlyle's plans who was
  not authorized to discuss them publicly. These products perform
  better in the current low-volatility market environment, rather
  than the high-volatility environment that the mutual funds would
  have thrived on, that person added.


  Carlyle could decide to launch another mutual fund in the future,
  the person said.


  A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment.


  The strategic shift comes one year after Carlyle hired Jeff
  Holland, a former senior executive at mutual fund conglomerate
  BlackRock Inc, to lead efforts to introduce alternative assets to
  eligible individual investors.


  Carlyle has also developed other products aimed at increasing the
  liquidity of its traditionally illiquid offerings.


  A captive feeder fund called CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund LLC,
  which allows individuals with net worth in excess of $1 million
  to commit as little as $50,000 to its private equity fund
  portfolio, had $550 million in net assets at the end of December.


  A business development company called Carlyle GMS Finance Inc,
  which lends to midsize U.S. companies, had $338.3 million in net
  assets at the end of last year. Carlyle plans to eventually take
  that vehicle public.


  Washington-based Carlyle, founded in 1987 by David Rubenstein,
  William Conway and Daniel D'Aniello, had $194 billion in assets
  under management as of the end of December.

The Carlyle Group has drawn in nearly $108 million for Carlyle Private Equity Access Fund 2014 since last November, as the New York firm reaches out to high net-worth individuals to broaden its investor base beyond big institutions.
After filing its first Form D for the fund on Nov. 11, Carlyle disclosed nearly $38 million in February and added roughly $20 million a month since then to reach its total as of June 17.
Carlyle is working with Raymond James and LPL Financial to target investors through the respective firms’ wealth channels, according to a source. The names of both firms are listed on the Form D filings for the fund.
A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment.
The fund provides investors with access to various Carlyle private equity funds for qualified purchasers – people with at least $5 million in investable assets, according to a source. The minimum $250,000 commitment is evenly divided between a small number of Carlyle funds.
Currently, the firm is raising capital for several pools. In the first quarter, it drew in a combined $4.4 billion for Carlyle Europe Partners IV, Carlyle Realty Partners VII and Carlyle Equity Opportunity Fund II, its mid-market buyout pool, and others.
The Access fund is Carlyle’s second fund aimed at individuals. CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund tipped the scales at $551 million at the end of 2014. That pool, managed by Central Park Group, invests in dozens of funds and secondary stakes in funds, including a few that aren’t run by Carlyle. CPG Carlyle Private Equity Fund is for “accredited” investors, meaning those with at least $1 million in assets not including their residence, and takes minimum investments of $50,000.
Not every initiative aimed at individuals has panned out for Carlyle. The firm has moved to liquidate Carlyle Core Allocation Fund, which drew in $53 million, and the Carlyle Enchanced Commodity Real Return Fund, which had no assets disclosed and was shuttered before it drew in any commitments, according to reports.
For years, Carlyle co-CEO David Rubenstein has been on the stump in support of opening up private equity to individuals. The macro trend of traditional pensions in the form of defined benefit plans giving way to defined contribution plans such as 401(k)s may fuel interest in other asset classes outside stocks and bonds, he said. But he has said it will take time to become a major force.
“All of the legal issues haven’t been resolved … but, inevitably, there will be a desire by people who have IRAs, 401(k)s and other kind of vehicles to participate [in private equity],” Rubenstein said recently. “It’s probably a generational thing before you see a big impact on numbers for firms like ours.”

Applicants' Representations
1. The Feeder Fund and the Master Fund are continuously offered non-diversified closed-end management investment companies registered under the Act and organized as Delaware limited liability companies. The Feeder Fund operates as a feeder fund in a master-feeder structure and intends to invest substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Master Fund invests primarily in “alternative” investment funds with an emphasis on private equity funds (e.g., buyout, growth, and mezzanine).
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Central Park Group, LLC, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and serves as investment adviser to the Feeder Fund and the Master Fund.
3. The Feeder Fund continuously offers its Units [1] 
           in private placements in reliance on the provisions of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. Units of the Feeder Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system. Applicants do not expect that any secondary market will develop for the Units.
4. The Feeder Fund currently offers a single class of Units (the “Class A Units”) at net asset value per Unit subject to a sales load and annual asset-based distribution fee. The Feeder Fund proposes to offer an additional Unit class (the “Class I Units”) at net asset value that may (but would not necessarily) be subject to a front-end sales load and an annual asset-based service and/or distribution fee. Both classes would be subject to minimum purchase requirements.
5. In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to unitholders, the Feeder Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Units at their then current net asset value in accordance with rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“1934 Act”) pursuant to written tenders by unitholders.[2] 
           Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Feeder Fund's board of trustees (“Board”), in its sole discretion.[3] 
           The Adviser Start Printed Page 28905anticipates to recommend that the Board authorize the Feeder Fund to offer to repurchase Units from unitholders quarterly.
6. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser, or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser acts as investment adviser, and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Units through tender offers conducted in compliance with rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.[4] 

7. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or distribution fees will comply with the provisions of rule 2830(d) of the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD Conduct Rule 2830”) as if that rule applied to the Feeder Fund.[5] 
           Applicants also represent that the Feeder Fund will disclose in its Confidential Memorandum, the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Units offered for sale by the Confidential Memorandum, as is required for open-end, multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, the Feeder Fund will disclose its expenses in unitholder reports, and disclose any arrangements that result in breakpoints in or elimination of sales loads in its Confidential Memorandum.[6] 
           The Feeder Fund will also comply, and will contractually require its placement agency to comply, with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding Confidential Memorandum disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Feeder Fund.[7] 

8. The Feeder Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of Units based on the net assets of the Feeder Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of a Feeder Fund allocated to a particular class of Units will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding Unit of that class. Applicants state that the Feeder Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
9. In the event the Feeder Fund imposes a CDSC, the applicants will comply with the provisions of rule 6c-10 under the Act, as if that rule applied to closed-end management investment companies. With respect to any waiver of, scheduled variation in, or elimination of the CDSC, the Feeder Fund will comply with rule 22d-1 under the Act as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Units
1. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Units of the Feeder Fund may be prohibited by section 18(c). Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Units of the Feeder Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Feeder Fund to issue multiple classes of Units.[8] 

3. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of unitholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Feeder Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Units and provide investors with a broader choice of unitholder options. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that the Feeder Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
CDSCs
4. Applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of section 6(c) of the Act. Rule 6c-10 under the Act permits open-end investment companies to impose CDSCs, subject to certain conditions. Applicants state that any CDSC imposed by the Feeder Fund will comply with rule 6c-10 under the Act as if the rule were applicable to closed-end investment companies. The Feeder Fund also will disclose CDSCs in accordance with the requirements of Form N-1A concerning CDSCs as if the Feeder Fund were an open-end investment company. Applicants further state that the Feeder Fund will apply the CDSC (and any waivers or scheduled variations of the CDSC) uniformly to all unitholders in a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule 22d-1 under the Act.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an Start Printed Page 28906affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit the Feeder Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3 and 22d-1 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with NASD Conduct Rule 2830, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.

Pessimism’s Pitfalls as an Investment Strategy: The Perils of the “Next Subprime”

Investors, CEOs, and regulators learned from the
Great Recession in ways that make the
“next subprime” crisis less likely. Rather
than fall prey to elaborate narratives of ruin,
or the tendency to expect that the next
recession will look like the last one, investors
would be better served to focus on conventional
risks and opportunities.The best investment
strategies will continue to be those that
outperform the market in most years rather
than those that deliver spectacular returns
in one year out of one hundred.
