Exclusive: Littlejohn closes Fund V on $2 bln hard cap


July 9, 2014
By Chris Witkowsky
 Follow @chriswitkowsky




 


Littlejohn & Co has held a final close for its fifth fund on its hard cap of $2 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the fundraising.
Littlejohn Fund V LP had been targeting $1.5 billion, but already had surpassed the original target by May. Chris Tofalli, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. Park Hill Group worked as placement agent on the fundraising.
Fund V closed last week. The fund hit the market around January and could have closed sooner but the firm waited for some LPs to get commitments approved, the person said. “This was done back in March or April,” the person said.
The firm was founded in 1996 by Angus Littlejohn and Michael Klein. It closed Fund IV on $1.34 billion in 2010, beating the $1.25 billion target. Fund III closed in 2005 on $850 million.
Limited partners in Fund IV authorized the firm to expand its focus to invest in non-control positions as well as conventional leveraged buyouts, Littlejohn said in a 2010 statement. The firm was targeting about 80 percent of its capital in control deals and the remainder in distressed opportunities with the intent to gain control. Fund V will continue the strategy.
Fund IV has been generating a 1.42x total value multiple and a 19.3 percent internal rate of return as of Sept. 30, 2013, according to performance information from the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund. Fund III was producing a 2.36x total value multiple and a 26.1 percent IRR, according to Oregon.

Littlejohn Doubles Down On Distressed Debt With $500M Side Fund


May 2, 2011
By Steve Bills






Sensing a continuing demand by limited partners to invest in distress, Greenwich, Conn., buyout shop Littlejohn & Co. is raising a $500 million side fund for non-control deals.
The firm, a specialist in distress investing, has already held a first close of $16.1 million for the Littlejohn Opportunities Fund LP, a regulatory filing from January showed. The filing also identified the new fund as a hedge fund, indicating that the fund will focus on publicly-traded securities, probably predominantly debt instruments.
Richard Maybaum, a managing director, Littlejohn & Co., disclosed the fund target last week at the Buyouts New York conference. The launch of the new fund follows closely on the close of Littlejohn Fund IV LP, a $1.34 billion pool that held its final close in November. Fund IV closed above its $1.25 billion target and just below its $1.35 billion hard cap.
Fund IV set aside 20 percent of its capital for to make non-control investments in distressed companies, often by buying up debt from the target’s creditors, with the intent to gain control. In fact, in 2007, the firm had persuaded investors in its 2005-vintage Littlejohn Fund III LP to broaden the fund’s mandate beyond conventional buyouts, specifically to gain the flexibility to allocate capital to non-control distress deals.
Maybaum joined Littlejohn as a partner in 2005 to invest and manage the dedicated Distressed Securities Pool of Fund III. He is now investing and managing the dedicated Distressed Securities Pool of Fund IV and the new fund.
Angus C. Littlejohn Jr., chairman and CEO of the firm, told Buyouts in an interview last November that he believed many companies had over-leveraged themselves during the boom years of 2006 and 2007, taking on covenants that would require them to grow EBITDA at mid-teen compounded rates, far beyond realistic growth expectations, Littlejohn said at the time. “They are not going to be able to outgrow that debt. At some point, they are going to have to restructure that balance sheet.”
