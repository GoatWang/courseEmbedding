Racal Electronics plc was once the third largest British electronics firm.
Listed on the London Stock Exchange and once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, Racal was a diversified company, offering products including: voice loggers and data recorders; point of sale terminals; laboratory instruments; military electronics, including radio and radar. At its height, it operated throughout 110 countries worldwide and employed over 30,000 people. It was the parent company of Vodafone, before the mobile telephony provider was sold in 1991.
Racal was purchased by Thomson-CSF (now Thales Group) in 2000, thereby giving the French firm access to the lucrative UK defence and armaments market.

Foundation[edit]
Racal was created in 1950 as Racal Ltd, the name being derived from the partners RAymond Brown and George CALder Cunningham.[1]
Ernest Harrison joined the company as employee number 13 as an accountant,[2][3][4] but later held the positions of chief buyer, personnel director and contract negotiator.
The first factory was located in Isleworth, west London. On outgrowing this site it moved to Bracknell, Berkshire in 1954, enticed by a 99-year lease at four shillings and sixpence per square foot - and no rent reviews.[5]
Although Racal had won a Royal Navy contract to build and supply a variant of the American Collins Model 51-J Radio Receiver, they were not granted a licence to build these sets by Collins Inc. This meant that Racal had to design and build a radio receiver from scratch. After almost bankrupting the company due to a £40,000 overspend,[5] the result was the 'RA17' - in production from 1955 to at least 1973 - designed in cooperation with Trevor Wadley and utilising his Wadley Loop circuit.[6]
Racal under Harrison[edit]
Harrison joined the company board in 1958, and as deputy managing director from 1961 helped Racal to obtain a Stock Market listing.[3] Harrison became chairman in 1966, when co-founder Ray Brown was lured away by the Ministry of Defence.[3]
Major deals[edit]
[2]

Negotiation of a British Army battlefield radio contract (initially Larkspur, later part of Clansman) which secured the future of Racal
Led the merger between Racal and British Communications Corporation, that bolstered Racal’s radio business
Bought Decca in 1980 in competition from General Electric Company plc, the rival British company led by Lord Weinstock
Buying the British Rail Telecommunications network, to form the basis of Racal Telecom
Creation and spin-out of Vodafone
Stopping the proposed takeover by Williams Holdings by demerging Chubb
Investing in National Lottery company Camelot Group
Selling Racal Telecom to Global Crossing
Selling Racal's remaining defence and industrial electronics divisions to Thomson-CSF of France for £1.8 billion

Under Harrsion, £1,000 invested in Racal in 1961 would have been worth £14.5million when he retired in 2000. Harrison received an estimated £25 million from the sale of Racal in 2000, and is estimated to have died with an accumulated total wealth of £40million.[3]
Decca Radar[edit]
In 1979, Racal bought Decca Radar forming Racal-Decca. Racal-Datacom conducted business in the United States.[7]
Vodafone[edit]
Main article: Vodafone
In 1980, Harrison agreed a deal with Lord Weinstock of General Electric Company plc to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battlefield radio technology. Briefing the head of Racal's military radio division Gerry Whent to drive the company into commercial mobile radio, Whent visited GE's factory in Virginia, USA in 1980.[8]
In 1982, Racal's newly formed subsidiary Racal Strategic Radio Ltd under CEO Whent, won one of two UK cellular telephone network licences; the other going to British Telecom[9][10] The network, known as Racal Vodafone was 80% owned by Racal, with Millicom with 15%, and the Hambros Technology Trust 5% respectively. Vodafone was launched on January 1, 1985.[11] Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited in 1985.[10] On December 29, 1986, Racal Electronics bought out the minority shareholders of Vodafone for GB£110 million.[12]
In 1988, 20% of Racal Telecom was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[13] This would lead to the situation where Racal Electronics was valued at less than its shareholding in Racal Telecom. Harrison demerged Racal Telecom in October 1991, forcing a positive valuation on the rest of Racal (colloquially known in the City of London as "the rump"). Vodafone would later become the largest mobile network in the world and the highest valued company on the FTSE 100. Immediately following the demerger, Williams Holdings launched a takeover bid for Racal. The bid, valued at £740m, failed.[14]
Chubb Security[edit]
In 1984, Racal bought Chubb, a security company that manufactured safes and locks. In 1992, Chubb was demerged from Racal and was subsequently taken over by Willams Holdings in 1997 for £1.3bn.
Racal Telecoms[edit]
Racal re-established a telecoms division with a major government contract in 1988 and the acquisition of British Rail Telecommunications in 1995. This division of the former nationalised industry owned telecoms infrastructure laid across the rail network.
Racal Instrumentation[edit]
Consisted of Racal Recorders (Hythe, Southampton) and Racal Instruments (Burham, near Slough). Racal acquired Thermionic Products in 1967, creating Racal Thermionics, renamed Racal Recorders in 1977.
National Lottery[edit]
Main article: Camelot Group
In 1994, Camelot Group won the franchise to operate the UK National Lottery, Racal had a 22.5% share. After one of the founder shareholders, GTECH, was bought out by Camelot this stake increased to 26.67% which Thales continues to hold.[15]
Break-up[edit]
In 1995 Racal expanded its defence businesses with the acquisition of the Thorn Sensors Group from Thorn EMI.[16] In 1998 all of Racal defence businesses were reorganised under Racal Defence Electronics Ltd into Racal Radar Defence Systems, Racal Radio and Racal Thorn.
In October 1999 Racal decided to sell its telecoms business to the American communications group, Global Crossing, for £1bn.[17]
Then in January 2000 Thomson-CSF announced a bid for the Company: Racal became Thomson-CSF Racal plc and later part of Thales plc with the renaming of the larger Thomson-CSF to Thales Group.[18]
In December 2008, Racal Acoustics Ltd was acquired by Esterline Technologies, and has become part of their Communications Systems platform.

	Explanatory Note.

	This
	Amendment No. 4 to the Registrants Form 8-A amends
	and restates in its entirety the Form 8-A previously filed by the Registrant with respect to the Registrants ordinary
	shares and American Depositary Shares. This amendment reflects changes to the Registrants Memorandum and Articles of
	Association since the filing of Amendment No. 3 to the
	Registrants Form 8-A with respect to its ordinary shares and American Depositary Shares.




	Item 1.

	  

	Description of Registrants Securities to be Registered.










	Description of Vodafone Ordinary Shares





	General




	     The following information is a summary of the material terms of the
	ordinary shares as set out in the Memorandum and Articles of Association of
	Vodafone Group Public Limited Company (Vodafone) as presently in effect. You
	are encouraged to read the actual Memorandum and Articles of Association which
	are filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Form 8-A/A.



	     Many Vodafone ordinary shares are held in the form of Vodafone American
	Depositary Shares (ADSs), each of which represents ten Vodafone ordinary
	shares. The Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement among Vodafone Group Public
	Limited Company, Vodafone Americas Inc., The Bank of New York,
	as depositary, and owners and beneficial
	owners of American Depositary Receipts governs the rights of holders of Vodafone
	ADSs as described below in Description of Vodafone American Depositary
	Shares. You should be aware that these rights are different from the rights
	of the holders of Vodafone ordinary shares.



	     All of the issued Vodafone ordinary shares are fully paid. Vodafone
	ordinary shares are represented in certificated form and also in uncertificated
	form under CREST, an electronic settlement system in the United Kingdom which
	enables Vodafone ordinary shares to be evidenced other than by a physical
	certificate and transferred electronically rather than by delivery of a
	physical certificate. Vodafone ordinary shares:






	 




	




	 




	may be represented by certificates in registered form issued
	(subject to the terms of issue of the shares) following issuance or
	receipt of the form of transfer bearing the appropriate stamp duty
	by Vodafone registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, The
	Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 7NH, England;










	 




	




	 




	may be in uncertificated form with the relevant CREST member
	account being credited with the Vodafone ordinary shares issued or
	transferred; or









	 




	




	 




	may be in the form of bearer shares.






	     Under English law, persons who are neither residents nor nationals of the
	U.K. may freely hold, vote and transfer Vodafone ordinary shares in the same
	manner and under the same terms as U.K. residents or nationals.



	- 2 -








	Table of Contents






	Share Capital




	     The ordinary share capital of Vodafone is denominated at a nominal value
	of U.S. $0.11 3/7.



	     The authorized share capital of Vodafone is 78,000,000,000 ordinary shares
	of U.S. $0.11 3/7 each and 50,000 7% cumulative fixed rate shares of £1 each.



	     In
	connection with a return of capital to shareholders in the amount of approximately £9 billion, as of
	July 31, 2006 the Group consolidated its share capital such that for every eight outstanding ordinary shares,
	seven new ordinary shares were issued (and for every eight existing ADRs, seven new ADRs were issued).
	The new ordinary shares have a nominal value of $0.11 3/7 each, compared to a nominal value of $0.10 each in
	relation to the previously outstanding ordinary shares.




	Dividends




	     Holders of Vodafone ordinary shares may, by ordinary resolution, declare
	dividends but may not declare dividends in excess of the amount recommended by
	the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends. No dividend may
	be paid other than out of profits available for distribution. Dividends on
	Vodafone ordinary shares will be announced and paid in whatever currency the
	directors so decide. Dividends with respect to Vodafone ADSs held by the
	depositary will be converted by the depositary into U.S. dollars, assuming
	payments are received by the depositary other than in U.S. dollars, and the
	depositary will distribute them to the holders of Vodafone ADSs.



	     Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association permit a scrip dividend
	scheme or schemes under which holders of Vodafone ordinary shares may be given
	the opportunity to elect to receive fully paid Vodafone ordinary shares instead
	of cash, or a combination of shares and cash, or to elect to apply
	the cash dividend in the purchase of additional ordinary shares, with respect to future dividends.




	Voting Rights




	     Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that voting on
	all substantive resolutions at a general meeting shall be decided on a poll.
	On a poll, each shareholder who is entitled to vote and be present in person or
	by proxy has one vote for every share held. All procedural resolutions shall
	be decided on a show of hands, where each shareholder who is present at the
	meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is
	demanded. In addition, Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association allow
	persons appointed as proxies of shareholders entitled to vote at general
	meetings to vote on a show of hands, as well as to vote on a poll and attend
	and speak at general meetings. Holders of Vodafone ordinary shares do not have
	cumulative voting rights. An extraordinary resolution at a separate meeting of
	Vodafone ordinary shareholders, requiring an affirmative vote of at least 75%
	of the votes cast in person or, if on a poll, in person or by proxy, is
	necessary under Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect
	to any proposal to vary the rights of ordinary shareholders.



	     Under English law, two shareholders present in person constitute a quorum
	for purposes of a general meeting, unless a companys articles of association
	specify otherwise. Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association do not
	specify otherwise, except that the shareholders do not need to be present in
	person, and may instead be present by proxy, to constitute a quorum.



	     Under English law, shareholders of a public company such as Vodafone are
	not permitted to pass resolutions by written consent.



	     Record holders of Vodafone ADSs are entitled to attend, speak and vote on
	a poll or a show of hands at any general meeting of Vodafone shareholders by
	the depositarys appointment of them as proxies with respect to the underlying
	Vodafone ordinary shares represented by their Vodafone ADSs. Alternatively,
	holders of Vodafone ADSs are entitled to vote by supplying their voting instructions to the depositary or its nominee, who will vote the
	Vodafone ordinary shares underlying their Vodafone ADSs in accordance with
	their instructions. In addition, holders of record of ordinary shares may
	appoint a proxy including a beneficial owner of those shares to attend, speak
	and vote on their behalf.

	Table of Contents






	Liquidation Rights




	     In the event of the liquidation of Vodafone, after payment of all
	liabilities and the deduction of any provision made under Section 719 of the
	U.K. Companies Act 1985 or Section 187 of the U.K. Insolvency Act 1986, which
	enables the liquidator to make payments to employees or former employees on the
	cessation or transfer of Vodafones business, the holders of
	any outstanding Vodafone cumulative fixed rate shares would be entitled to a sum
	equal to the capital paid up on such shares. The holders of Vodafone ordinary
	shares will receive any amounts remaining after the foregoing payments have
	been made.




	Preemptive Rights and New Issues of Shares




	     Under Section 80 of the U.K. Companies Act 1985, directors are, with
	certain exceptions, unable to allot relevant securities without the authority
	of the shareholders in a general meeting. Relevant securities as defined in
	the U.K. Companies Act 1985 includes Vodafone ordinary shares or securities
	convertible into Vodafone ordinary shares. In addition, Section 89 of the U.K.
	Companies Act 1985 imposes further restrictions on the issue of equity
	securities (as defined in the U.K. Companies Act 1985, which includes Vodafone
	ordinary shares and securities convertible into ordinary shares) which are, or
	are to be, paid up wholly in cash and not first offered to existing
	shareholders. Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association allow
	shareholders to authorize directors for a period up to five years to allot (1)
	relevant securities generally up to an amount fixed by the shareholders and (2)
	equity securities for cash other than in connection with a rights issue. In
	accordance with institutional investor guidelines, the amount of relevant
	securities to be fixed by shareholders is normally restricted to one third of
	the existing issued ordinary share capital, and the amount of equity securities
	to be issued for cash other than in connection with a rights issue is
	restricted to 5% of the existing issued ordinary share capital.




	Disclosure of Interests in Shares




	     The U.K. Companies Act 1985 gives Vodafone the power to require persons
	who it believes to have, or to have acquired within the previous three years,
	an interest in its voting shares, to disclose certain information with respect
	to those interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to
	disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer
	and receipt of dividends and payments in respect of those shares. In this
	context, the term interest is widely defined and will generally include an
	interest of any kind whatsoever in voting shares, including any interest of a
	holder of a Vodafone ADS.




	Changes in Capital




	     Vodafones ordinary shareholders may pass an ordinary resolution to do any
	of the following:






	 




	(1)




	 




	consolidate, or consolidate and then divide, all or any of
	Vodafones share capital into new shares of larger nominal amounts
	than its existing shares;






	- 4 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	(2)




	 




	cancel any shares which have not, at the date of the relevant
	resolution, been subscribed or agreed to be subscribed by any person
	and reduce the amount of Vodafones authorized share capital by the
	amount of the shares so canceled;









	 




	(3)




	 




	divide some or all of Vodafones shares into shares of a
	smaller nominal amount; and









	 




	(4)




	 




	increase Vodafones share capital.






	     Vodafone is also able:






	 




	(1)




	 




	with the authority of shareholders by ordinary,
	extraordinary, or special resolution, depending on the circumstances
	relating to the purchase, to purchase its own shares; and









	 




	(2)




	 




	by special resolution and, where required by the U.K.
	Companies Act 1985, with the sanction of the court, to reduce its share
	capital, any capital redemption reserve, share premium account or
	any other undistributable reserve.







	Transfer of Shares




	     Except as described in this paragraph, Vodafones Memorandum and Articles
	of Association do not restrict the transferability of Vodafone ordinary shares.
	Vodafone ordinary shares are able to be transferred by an instrument in any
	usual form or in any form acceptable to the directors. The directors may refuse
	to register a transfer:






	 




	(1)




	 




	if the shares to be transferred are not fully paid;









	 




	(2)




	 




	if the transfer is not stamped and duly presented for
	registration, together with the share certificate and evidence of
	title as the directors reasonably require;









	 




	(3)




	 




	if the transfer is with respect to more than one class of
	shares;









	 




	(4)




	 




	if the transfer is in favor of more than four persons
	jointly; or









	 




	(5)




	 




	in certain circumstances, if the holder has failed to provide
	the required particulars to the investigating power referred to
	under Disclosure of Interests in Shares above.






	     Vodafone may not refuse to register transfers of fully paid-up Vodafone
	ordinary shares in certificated form if this refusal would prevent dealings in
	the shares on the official list maintained by the U.K. Listing Authority from
	taking place on an open and proper basis. The registration of transfers may be
	suspended at any time and for any period as the directors may determine. The
	register of shareholders may not be closed for more than 30 days in any year.




	General Meetings and Notices




	     A shareholder who is not registered on Vodafones register of shareholders
	with an address in the U.K. and who has not supplied to Vodafone an address
	within the U.K. for the purpose of giving notice will not be entitled to
	receive notices from Vodafone. In certain circumstances, Vodafone will be able
	to give notices to shareholders by advertisement in newspapers in the U.K. Holders of Vodafone ADSs are entitled to receive
	notices under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to Vodafone ADSs. See
	Description of Vodafone American Depositary SharesVoting Rights. Under
	Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association, the Annual General Meeting
	of shareholders shall be held within 15 months after the preceding Annual
	General Meeting and at a time and place determined by the directors.

	Amendment of Governing Instruments




	     Under English law, shareholders have the power to amend:






	 




	(1)




	 




	the objects, or purpose, clause in a companys memorandum of
	association; and









	 




	(2)




	 




	any provisions of the companys articles of association.






	     by special resolution, subject to, in the case of amendments to the
	objects clause of the memorandum of association, the right of dissenting
	shareholders to apply to the courts to cancel the amendments.



	     Under English law, the board of directors is not authorized to change the
	memorandum of association or the articles of association.



	     Amendments affecting the rights of the holders of any class of shares may,
	depending on the rights attached to the class and the nature of the amendments,
	also require approval by extraordinary resolution of the classes affected in
	separate class meetings.




	Shareholder Proposals and Shareholder Nominations of Directors




	     Under English law, shareholders may demand that a resolution be voted on
	at a general meeting if the demand is made:






	 




	(1)




	 




	by shareholders holding at least 5% of the voting power of
	shares having a right to vote on the resolution; or









	 




	(2)




	 




	by at least 100 shareholders holding shares on which there
	has been paid up an average sum per shareholder of at least £100.






	     The shareholders must deposit the demand at the companys registered
	office at least six weeks before the general meeting to which it relates.



	     In general, resolutions to appoint directors must be put to shareholders
	on the basis of one resolution for each nominated director. A resolution
	including more than one director may be presented to be voted upon at a general
	meeting only if the shareholders have first unanimously approved so doing.




	Shareholders Votes on Certain Transactions




	     The U.K. Companies Act 1985 provides for schemes of arrangement, which are
	arrangements or compromises between a company and any class of shareholders or
	creditors and used in certain types of reconstructions, amalgamations, capital
	reorganizations or takeovers. These arrangements require the approval at a
	special meeting convened by order of the court of:



	- 6 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	(1)




	 




	shareholders or creditors representing 75% in value of the
	capital held by or debt owed to the class of shareholders or
	creditors or class thereof present and voting, either in person or
	by proxy; and









	 




	(2)




	 




	the court.






	     Once approved and sanctioned, all shareholders and creditors of the
	relevant class are bound by the terms of the scheme.



	     Under the rules of the U.K. Listing Authority, shareholder approval:






	 




	(1)




	 




	is usually required for an acquisition or disposal by a
	listed company if, generally, the size of the company or business to
	be acquired or disposed of represents 25% or more of the size of the
	listed company; and









	 




	(2)




	 




	may also be required for an acquisition or disposal of assets
	between a listed company and parties, including,









	 




	(a)




	 




	directors of the company or its subsidiaries,









	 




	(b)




	 




	holders of 10% of the nominal value of any
	class of the companys or any holding companys or its
	subsidiarys shares having the right to vote, or









	 




	(c)




	 




	any of their associates.






	     The U.K. Companies Act 1985 also provides:






	 




	(1)




	 




	that where a takeover offer is made for the shares of a U.K.
	company; and









	 




	(2)




	 




	within four months of the date of the offer, the offeror has
	acquired or contracted to acquire at least nine-tenths in value of
	the shares of any class to which the offer relates, the offeror may,
	within two months of reaching the nine-tenths level, require
	shareholders who do not accept the offer to transfer their shares on
	the terms of the offer. A dissenting shareholder may object to the
	transfer or its proposed terms by applying to the court within six
	weeks of the date on which notice of the transfer was given. In the
	absence of fraud or oppression, the court is unlikely to order that
	the acquisition not take effect, but it may specify terms of the
	transfer that it finds appropriate. A minority shareholder is also
	entitled in these circumstances, in the alternative, to require the
	offeror to acquire his shares on the terms of the offer.







	Rights of Inspection




	     Except when closed under the provisions of the U.K. Companies Act 1985,
	the register and index of names of shareholders of an English company may be
	inspected during business hours:






	 




	(1)




	 




	for free, by its shareholders, including, in the case of
	Vodafone, holders of Vodafone ADSs; and






	- 7 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	(2)




	 




	for a fee by any other person.






	     In both cases, the documents may be copied for a fee.



	     Under English law, the shareholders of an English public company may also
	inspect, without charge, during business hours:






	 




	(1)




	 




	minutes of meetings of the shareholders (and obtain copies of
	the minutes for a fee); and









	 




	(2)




	 




	service contracts of the companys directors, if the
	contracts have more than 12 months unexpired or require more than 12
	months notice to terminate.






	     In addition, the published annual accounts of a public company are
	required to be available for shareholders at a general meeting and a
	shareholder is entitled to a copy of these accounts. Under the U.K. Companies
	Act 1985, shareholders of a quoted company have rights to inspect the companys
	last annual accounts, the last directors report, the last directors
	remuneration report and the auditors report on those accounts and the
	auditable part of the directors remuneration report for the financial year for
	which those accounts are prepared. The shareholders of Vodafone do not have
	rights to inspect the minutes of meetings of its directors.




	Removal of Directors




	     Under the U.K. Companies Act 1985, shareholders may remove a director
	without cause by ordinary resolution, irrespective of any provisions of the
	companys articles of association or of a service contract the director has
	with the company, provided that 28 clear days notice of the resolution is
	given to the company.



	     Vodafones Memorandum and Articles of Association provide that all
	directors who have been in office for three years of more since they were
	elected or re-elected will retire from office. These retired directors will be
	eligible for re-election.




	Shareholders Suits




	     While English law only permits a shareholder to initiate a lawsuit on
	behalf of the company in limited circumstances, the U.K. Companies Act 1985
	permits a shareholder whose name is on the register of shareholders of the
	company to apply for a court order:






	 




	(1)




	 




	when the companys affairs are being or have been conducted
	in a manner unfairly prejudicial to the interests of all or some
	shareholders, including the shareholder making the claim or









	 




	(2)




	 




	when any act or omission of the company is or would be so
	prejudicial.






	     A court has wide discretion in granting relief and may authorize civil
	proceedings to be brought in the name of the company by a shareholder on terms
	that the court directs. Except in these limited circumstances, English law does
	not generally permit class action lawsuits by shareholders on behalf of the
	company or on behalf of other shareholders.



	     In order to become a shareholder and enforce these rights under English
	law, holders of Vodafone ADSs are required to withdraw from the depositary at
	least one of their Vodafone ordinary shares underlying the Vodafone ADSs. See Description of
	Vodafone American Depositary SharesDeposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation for
	information about how to withdraw Vodafone ordinary shares.

	Description of Vodafone American Depositary Shares





	General




	     The Bank of New York is the depositary with respect to Vodafone American
	Depositary Shares, or ADSs. Each ADS is represented by one American Depositary
	Receipt or ADR and represents ownership interests in, and the right to receive,
	ten Vodafone ordinary shares. The ordinary shares are deposited with the
	custodian, which currently is the London office of The Bank of New York. Each
	ADS also represents securities, cash or other property deposited with The Bank
	of New York but not distributed to ADS holders. The Bank of New Yorks
	Corporate Trust Office is located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York,
	10286, its principal executive office is located at One Wall Street, New York,
	New York 10286, and the custodians office is located at One Canada Square,
	London E14 5AL, England.



	     Because The Bank of New York is actually the legal owner of the underlying
	ordinary shares, holders of Vodafone ADSs generally exercise the rights of a
	shareholder through it, although they have the option to attend, speak and vote
	at shareholder meetings as its proxy, as described below. An amended and
	restated deposit agreement among Vodafone Group Public Limited Company, Vodafone Americas Inc., The
	Bank of New York, as depositary, and owners and beneficial owners of Vodafone ADRs sets out the obligations of The
	Bank of New York. New York law governs the deposit agreement and the Vodafone
	American Depositary Receipts evidencing the ADSs.



	     Holders of Vodafone ADSs may hold their ADSs either directly or indirectly
	through a broker or financial institution. This description assumes that
	holders of Vodafone ADSs hold their ADSs directly. Indirect holders of
	Vodafone ADSs must rely on the procedures of their broker or financial
	institution to assert the rights of ADS holders described in this section.
	Indirect holders of ADSs should consult with their broker or financial
	institution to find out what those procedures are.



	     The following is a summary of the deposit agreement. Because it is a
	summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to ADS
	holders. For more complete information, ADS holders should read the entire
	agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.2 to this Form 8-A/A and the Vodafone
	ADR, which is filed as Exhibit 1.2 to this Form 8-A/A. Copies of the agreement
	and the Vodafone ADR are available for inspection at the Corporate Trust Office
	of the depositary and at the London office of the custodian set forth above.




	Share Dividends and Other Distributions




	     The Bank of New York will pay ADS holders the cash dividends or other
	distributions it or the custodian receives on shares or other deposited
	securities, after deducting its fees and expenses. ADS holders will receive
	these distributions in proportion to the number of ordinary shares their ADSs
	represent.

	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 





	Cash

	. The Bank of New York will, as promptly as practicable
	after payment, convert any cash dividend or distribution Vodafone
	pays on the shares, other than any dividend or distribution paid in
	U.S. dollars, into U.S. dollars. If that is not possible on a
	reasonable basis, or if any approval from any government is needed
	and cannot be obtained, the agreement allows The Bank of New York to
	distribute pounds sterling only to those ADS holders to whom it is
	possible to do so or to hold pounds sterling it cannot convert for
	the account of the ADS holders who have not been paid. It will not
	invest pounds sterling and it will not be liable for any interest.









	 








	 




	Before making a distribution, The Bank of New York will deduct any
	withholding taxes that must be paid under applicable laws. It
	will distribute only whole U.S. dollars and cents and will round
	any fractional amounts to the nearest whole cent.









	 




	




	 





	Shares

	. The Bank of New York will distribute new ADSs
	representing any shares Vodafone distributes as a dividend or free
	distribution, if Vodafone requests it to make this distribution.
	The Bank of New York will only distribute whole ADSs. It may sell
	shares which would require it to issue a fractional ADS and
	distribute the net proceeds to the holders entitled to those shares.









	 








	 




	If The Bank of New York does not distribute additional cash or
	ADSs, each ADS will also represent the new shares.









	 




	




	 





	Rights to Receive Additional Shares

	. If Vodafone offers
	holders of securities any rights, including rights to subscribe for
	additional shares, The Bank of New York may take actions necessary
	to make these rights available to ADS holders. If The Bank of New
	York determines that it is not legal or not feasible to make these
	rights available to ADS holders, The Bank of New York may sell the
	rights and allocate the net proceeds to holders accounts. The Bank
	of New York may allow rights that are not distributed or sold to
	lapse.









	 








	 




	If The Bank of New York makes rights available to ADS holders,
	upon instruction from an ADS holder it will exercise the rights
	and purchase the shares on the holders behalf. The Bank of New
	York will then deposit the shares and issue ADSs to the holder.
	It will only exercise rights if the ADS holder pays it the
	exercise price and any charges the rights require the ADS holder
	to pay.









	 








	 




	U.S. securities laws may restrict the sale, deposit, cancellation,
	and transfer of the ADSs issued after exercise of rights. In this
	case, The Bank of New York may issue the ADSs under a separate
	restricted deposit agreement which will contain the same
	provisions as the agreement, except for changes needed to put the
	restrictions in place.









	 








	 




	The Bank of New York will not offer ADS holders rights unless
	those rights and the securities to which the rights relate are
	either exempt from registration or have been registered under the
	Securities Act of 1933 with respect to a distribution to them.
	Vodafone will have no obligation to register under the Securities
	Act of 1933 those rights or the securities to which they relate.






	- 10 -








	Table of Contents








	 




	




	 





	Other Distributions

	. The Bank of New York will send to ADS
	holders anything else Vodafone distributes on deposited securities
	by any means The Bank of New York thinks is equitable and practical.
	If it cannot make the distribution in that way, The Bank of New
	York may decide to sell what Vodafone distributedfor example by
	public or private saleand distribute the net proceeds, in the same
	way as it does with cash.









	 








	 




	Vodafone has no obligation to take any other action to permit the
	distribution of ADSs, shares, rights or anything else to ADS
	holders.







	Deposit, Withdrawal and Cancellation




	     The Bank of New York will issue ADSs if a Vodafone shareholder or the
	shareholders broker deposits ordinary shares, along with any appropriate
	instruments of transfer, or endorsement, with the custodian. The Bank of New
	York may also require a shareholder to deliver evidence of any necessary
	approvals of the governmental agency in England, if any, which is responsible
	for regulating currency exchange at that time, and an agreement transferring
	the shareholders right to receive dividends or other property. Upon payment of
	its fees and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer
	taxes or fees, The Bank of New York will register the appropriate number of
	ADSs in the names the shareholder requests and will issue book-entry ADSs or,
	if the shareholder specifically requests, deliver the ADSs at its Corporate
	Trust Office to the persons the shareholder requests.



	     An ADS holder may submit a written request to withdraw ordinary shares and
	turn in the holders certificated ADSs, if any, at the Corporate Trust Office
	of The Bank of New York. Any deposited securities that the ADS holder withdraws
	will be delivered to the holder in registered form. Upon payment of its fees
	and of any taxes or charges, such as stamp taxes or stock transfer taxes or
	fees, The Bank of New York will deliver the deposited securities underlying the
	ADSs at the office of the custodian, except that The Bank of New York may
	deliver at its Corporate Trust Office any dividends or distributions with
	respect to the deposited securities represented by the ADSs, or any proceeds
	from the sale of any dividends, distributions or rights, which may be held by
	The Bank of New York. Alternatively, at the ADS holders request, risk and
	expense, The Bank of New York will deliver the deposited securities at its
	Corporate Trust Office in New York City.




	Voting Rights




	     An ADS holder on a record date fixed by The Bank of New York may attend,
	speak and vote at Vodafone shareholder meetings of holders of the same class of
	securities as the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs.



	     The Bank of New York will enable an ADS holder to attend, speak and vote
	at a meeting by appointing such holder its proxy for the ordinary shares
	underlying the holders ADSs. If the ADS holder does not wish to attend a
	meeting, the holder may appoint The Bank of New York or another person as a
	substitute proxy to attend, speak and vote on the holders behalf.



	     Indirect holders of ADSs, e.g., those that hold Vodafone through a
	brokerage account or otherwise in street name, are not entitled to attend or
	speak at a meeting, but are able to vote their ADSs through the depositary.



	- 11 -








	Table of Contents





	     The Bank of New York will notify ADS holders of shareholder meetings and
	arrange to deliver certain materials to them. The materials will (1) describe
	the meeting time, place and the matters to be voted on and (2) explain how ADS
	holders may instruct The Bank of New York to vote their shares or deposited
	securities underlying their ADSs as they direct if they choose to appoint The
	Bank of New York as their substitute proxy, or how they may appoint a different
	substitute proxy. For instructions to be valid, The Bank of New York must
	receive them on or before the date specified in the instructions. The Bank of
	New York will, to the extent practical, subject to applicable law and the
	provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Vodafone vote the
	underlying ordinary shares as an ADS holder instructs. The Bank of New York
	will only vote as an ADS holder instructs.



	     Although the depositary will try to send the notice of the vote reasonably
	in advance of a shareholder meeting, Vodafone will not be able to assure that
	ADS holders will receive the voting materials in time to ensure that they can
	attend, speak and vote at a meeting, instruct The Bank of New York to vote
	their shares or appoint a different substitute proxy. In addition, The Bank of
	New York and its agents are not responsible for failing to carry out voting
	instructions or for the manner of carrying out voting instructions.

	transfer taxes, stamp duty reserve tax or
	withholding taxes








	- 12 -








	Table of Contents






	Payment of Taxes




	     The Bank of New York may deduct the amount of any taxes owed from any
	payments to an ADS holder. It may also restrict the transfer of the holders
	ADSs or restrict the withdrawal of underlying deposited securities until the
	ADS holder pays any taxes owed on the holders ADSs or underlying securities.
	It may also sell deposited securities to pay any taxes owed. The ADS holder
	will remain liable if the proceeds of the sale are not enough to pay the taxes.
	If The Bank of New York sells deposited securities, it will, if appropriate,
	reduce the number of ADSs held by the ADS holder to reflect the sale and pay to
	the holder any proceeds, or send to the holder any property, remaining after it
	has paid the taxes.




	Reclassifications, Recapitalizations and Mergers




	     If Vodafone:






	 




	




	 




	Changes the nominal or par value of any of the Vodafone ordinary shares;









	 




	




	 




	Reclassifies, splits or consolidates any of the Vodafone ordinary shares;









	 




	




	 




	Distributes securities on any of the Vodafone ordinary shares
	that are not distributed to ADS holders; or









	 




	




	 




	Recapitalizes, reorganizes, merges, consolidates, sells its
	assets, or takes any similar action.









	 




	then:









	 




	(1)




	 




	The cash, shares or other securities received by The Bank of
	New York will become new deposited securities under the deposit
	agreement, and each ADS will automatically represent its equal share
	of the new deposited securities; and









	 




	(2)




	 




	The Bank of New York will, if Vodafone asks it to, issue new
	ADSs or ask ADS holders to surrender their outstanding ADSs in
	exchange for new ADSs identifying the new deposited securities.







	Disclosure of Interests




	     The obligation of a holder of Vodafone ordinary shares and other persons
	with an interest in the shares to disclose information to Vodafone under
	English law also applies to any persons with an interest in the ADSs. The
	consequences for failure to comply with these provisions will be the same for
	ADS holders and any other persons with an interest in ADSs as for a holder of
	Vodafone ordinary shares. See Description of Vodafone Ordinary
	SharesDisclosure of Interests in Shares.




	Amendment and Termination




	     Vodafone may agree with The Bank of New York to amend the deposit
	agreement and the Vodafone ADRs for any reason without the consent of ADS
	holders. If the amendment adds or increases fees or charges, except for taxes
	and governmental charges, or prejudices an important right of ADS holders, it
	will only become effective three months after The Bank of New York notifies the
	holders of the amendment. At the time an amendment becomes effective, ADS
	holders are considered, by continuing to hold their ADS, to agree to the
	amendment and to



	- 13 -








	Table of Contents





	be bound by the agreement as amended. However, no amendment will impair
	an ADS holders right to receive the deposited securities in exchange for the holders ADSs.



	     The Bank of New York will terminate the deposit agreement if Vodafone asks
	it to do so, in which case it must notify ADS holders at least 90 days before
	termination. The Bank of New York may also terminate the agreement after
	notifying ADS holders (30 days prior to the date such termination is to take effect) if The Bank of New York informs Vodafone that it would
	like to resign and Vodafone does not appoint a new depositary bank within 90
	days.



	     If any ADSs remain outstanding after termination, The Bank of New York
	will stop registering the transfer of ADSs, will stop distributing dividends to
	ADS holders, and will not give any further notices or do anything else under

	ADS Holders Right to Receive the Shares Underlying their ADSs




	     An ADS holder has the right to cancel the holders ADSs and withdraw the

	




	 




	due to temporary delays caused by The Bank of New York or
	Vodafone closing its transfer books, the deposit of ordinary shares
	in connection with voting at a shareholders meeting, or the payment
	of dividends;









	 




	




	 




	when the holder owes money to pay fees, taxes and similar
	charges; or









	 




	




	 




	when it is necessary to prohibit withdrawals in order to
	comply with any laws or governmental regulations that apply to ADSs
	or to the withdrawal of ordinary shares or other deposited
	securities.






	     This right of withdrawal may not be limited by any provision of the
	deposit agreement.




	Limitations on Obligations and Liability to ADS Holders




	     The deposit agreement expressly limits the obligations of Vodafone and The
	Bank of New York. It also limits the liability of Vodafone and The Bank of New
	York. Vodafone and The Bank of New York:

	




	 




	may rely upon any advice of or information from any legal
	counsel, accountants, any person depositing ordinary shares, any ADS
	holder or any other person whom they believe in good faith is
	competent to give them that advice or information.






	     In the deposit agreement, Vodafone and The Bank of New York agree to
	indemnify each other (and each others respective directors,
	employees, agents and affiliates) under specified circumstances.




	Requirements for Depositary Actions




	     Before The Bank of New York issues or registers the transfer of an ADS,
	makes a distribution on an ADS, or permits withdrawal of ordinary shares,
	Vodafone or The Bank of New York may require:






	 




	




	 




	payment of taxes, including stamp duty reserve and stock
	transfer taxes or other governmental charges, and transfer or
	registration fees charged by third parties for the transfer of any
	shares or other deposited securities, as well as the fees and
	expenses of The Bank of New York;









	 




	




	 




	production of satisfactory proof of the identity of the
	person presenting ordinary shares for deposit or ADSs upon
	withdrawal, and of the genuineness of any signature or other
	information they deem necessary; and









	 




	




	 




	compliance with regulations The Bank of New York may
	establish consistent with the deposit agreement, including
	presentation of transfer documents.






	     The Bank of New York may refuse to deliver, transfer, or register
	transfers of ADSs generally when the transfer books of The Bank of New York are
	closed or at any time if The Bank of New York or Vodafone thinks it advisable
	to do so.




	Pre-Release of ADSs




	     The Bank of New York may issue ADSs before deposit of the underlying
	ordinary shares. This is called a pre-release of ADSs. The Bank of New York may
	also deliver ordinary shares prior to the receipt and cancellation of
	pre-released ADSs even if the ADSs are canceled before the pre-release
	transaction has been closed out. A pre-release is closed out as soon as the underlying ordinary shares are delivered to The Bank of New York. The Bank
	of New York may receive ADSs instead of ordinary shares to close out a
	pre-release. The Bank of New York may pre-release ADSs only under the
	following conditions:

	will not take any action with respect to the
	ADSs or ordinary shares that is inconsistent with the
	assignment of beneficial ownership (including, without the
	consent of The Bank of New York, disposing of the ADSs or
	ordinary shares) other than in satisfaction of the
	pre-release;









	 




	(2)




	 




	the pre-release must be fully collateralized with cash or
	collateral that The Bank of New York considers appropriate; and









	 




	(3)




	 




	The Bank of New York must be able to close out the
	pre-release on not more than five business days notice.






	     The pre-release will be subject to whatever indemnities and credit
	regulations that The Bank of New York considers appropriate. In addition, The
	Bank of New York will limit the number of ADSs that may be outstanding at any
	time as a result of pre-release.

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]




The headquarters of Vodafone Romania in Bucharest


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Egypt

In November 1998, the Vodafone Egypt network went live under the name ClickGSM.[49]
On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with Telecom Egypt, resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.[50]
On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

Kuwait

On 18 September 2002, Vodafone signed a Partner Network Agreement with MTC group of Kuwait. The agreement involved the rebranding of MTC to MTC-Vodafone. On 29 December 2003, Vodafone signed another Partner Network Agreement with Kuwait's MTC group. The second agreement involved co-operation in Bahrain and the branding of the network as MTC-Vodafone.[54]

South Africa (Vodacom)

On 3 November 2004, the Company announced that its South African affiliate Vodacom had agreed to introduce Vodafone's international services, such as Vodafone live! and partner agreements, to its local market.[55]
In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Ghana

On 3 July 2008, Vodafone agreed to acquire a 70% stake in Ghana Telecom for $900 million. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008. The same group-led consortium won the second fixed-line licence in Qatar on 15 September 2008.[62]
On 15 April 2009, Ghana Telecom, along with its mobile subsidiary OneTouch, was rebranded as Vodafone Ghana.[63]

U.A.E.

On 28 January 2009, the group announced a partner network agreement with Du, the second-largest operator in the United Arab Emirates. The agreement involved co-operation on international clients, handset procurement, mobile broadband etc.[64]

Libya

On 24 February 2010, the group signed a partner network agreement with the second-largest operator in Libya, al Madar.[65]
Cameroon
On 23 September 2016, Vodafone extended its activities to Cameroon by signing a partnership with Afrimax, a 4G-LTE telecommunications operator in Africa. Vodafone Cameroon Launched a "Youth Program" in the Universities to support and encourage the Cameroonian students.[66]
The Americas[edit]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]
In December 2014, Vodafone announced an agreement with T-Mobile US to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service using its network, set to launch in 2015.[74]

The division offers integrated communication solutions in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.[141][142] Its services include domestic and international voice and data, machine-to-machine services, mobile email, mobile broadband, managed services, mobile payment and mobile recording.[144]
In December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company.[145] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within VGE,[40] working on cloud computing and professional services.[146]
Vodafone Global Enterprise operates in over 65 countries, with "Northern Europe" (based in London, United Kingdom), "Central Europe", "Southern Europe and Africa", "Asia Pacific & Sub-Saharan Africa" (based in Singapore) and "Americas" geographical divisions.[147] VGE's major customers include Deutsche Post,[148] The Linde Group,[149] Unilever,[150] and Volkswagen Group.[151]
Products and services[edit]

In October 2009, it launched Vodafone 360, a new internet service for the mobile, PC and Mac. This was discontinued in December 2011 after disappointing hardware sales.[152] This was after the Director of Internet Services resigned in September 2010 tweeting "5 days before I leave Vodafone. Freedom beckons."[153] In February 2010, Vodafone launched the world's cheapest mobile phone known as Vodafone 150, intended to sell for below $15 (£10) in the developing world. It was initially launched in India, Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho, Kenya and Ghana.[154]
Mobile money transfer services[edit]
In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]




The headquarters of Vodafone Romania in Bucharest


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Egypt

In November 1998, the Vodafone Egypt network went live under the name ClickGSM.[49]
On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with Telecom Egypt, resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.[50]
On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

Kuwait

On 18 September 2002, Vodafone signed a Partner Network Agreement with MTC group of Kuwait. The agreement involved the rebranding of MTC to MTC-Vodafone. On 29 December 2003, Vodafone signed another Partner Network Agreement with Kuwait's MTC group. The second agreement involved co-operation in Bahrain and the branding of the network as MTC-Vodafone.[54]

South Africa (Vodacom)

On 3 November 2004, the Company announced that its South African affiliate Vodacom had agreed to introduce Vodafone's international services, such as Vodafone live! and partner agreements, to its local market.[55]
In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Ghana

On 3 July 2008, Vodafone agreed to acquire a 70% stake in Ghana Telecom for $900 million. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008. The same group-led consortium won the second fixed-line licence in Qatar on 15 September 2008.[62]
On 15 April 2009, Ghana Telecom, along with its mobile subsidiary OneTouch, was rebranded as Vodafone Ghana.[63]

U.A.E.

On 28 January 2009, the group announced a partner network agreement with Du, the second-largest operator in the United Arab Emirates. The agreement involved co-operation on international clients, handset procurement, mobile broadband etc.[64]

Libya

On 24 February 2010, the group signed a partner network agreement with the second-largest operator in Libya, al Madar.[65]
Cameroon
On 23 September 2016, Vodafone extended its activities to Cameroon by signing a partnership with Afrimax, a 4G-LTE telecommunications operator in Africa. Vodafone Cameroon Launched a "Youth Program" in the Universities to support and encourage the Cameroonian students.[66]
The Americas[edit]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]
In December 2014, Vodafone announced an agreement with T-Mobile US to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service using its network, set to launch in 2015.[74]

A map showing the countries where Vodafone Global Enterprise has operations (coloured in red)


Vodafone Global Enterprise is the business services division, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group. It was established in April 2007 to provide telecommunications and information technology services to large corporations.[141][142][143]
The division offers integrated communication solutions in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.[141][142] Its services include domestic and international voice and data, machine-to-machine services, mobile email, mobile broadband, managed services, mobile payment and mobile recording.[144]
In December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company.[145] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within VGE,[40] working on cloud computing and professional services.[146]
Vodafone Global Enterprise operates in over 65 countries, with "Northern Europe" (based in London, United Kingdom), "Central Europe", "Southern Europe and Africa", "Asia Pacific & Sub-Saharan Africa" (based in Singapore) and "Americas" geographical divisions.[147] VGE's major customers include Deutsche Post,[148] The Linde Group,[149] Unilever,[150] and Volkswagen Group.[151]
Products and services[edit]

In October 2009, it launched Vodafone 360, a new internet service for the mobile, PC and Mac. This was discontinued in December 2011 after disappointing hardware sales.[152] This was after the Director of Internet Services resigned in September 2010 tweeting "5 days before I leave Vodafone. Freedom beckons."[153] In February 2010, Vodafone launched the world's cheapest mobile phone known as Vodafone 150, intended to sell for below $15 (£10) in the developing world. It was initially launched in India, Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho, Kenya and Ghana.[154]
Mobile money transfer services[edit]
In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

TECSOS – mobile phones have been adapted to allow victims of domestic violence to activate immediate contact with the emergency services if they are in danger
Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
Sir Gerald Whent, at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]




The headquarters of Vodafone Romania in Bucharest


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Egypt

In November 1998, the Vodafone Egypt network went live under the name ClickGSM.[49]
On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with Telecom Egypt, resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.[50]
On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

Kuwait

On 18 September 2002, Vodafone signed a Partner Network Agreement with MTC group of Kuwait. The agreement involved the rebranding of MTC to MTC-Vodafone. On 29 December 2003, Vodafone signed another Partner Network Agreement with Kuwait's MTC group. The second agreement involved co-operation in Bahrain and the branding of the network as MTC-Vodafone.[54]

South Africa (Vodacom)

On 3 November 2004, the Company announced that its South African affiliate Vodacom had agreed to introduce Vodafone's international services, such as Vodafone live! and partner agreements, to its local market.[55]
In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Ghana

On 3 July 2008, Vodafone agreed to acquire a 70% stake in Ghana Telecom for $900 million. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008. The same group-led consortium won the second fixed-line licence in Qatar on 15 September 2008.[62]
On 15 April 2009, Ghana Telecom, along with its mobile subsidiary OneTouch, was rebranded as Vodafone Ghana.[63]

U.A.E.

On 28 January 2009, the group announced a partner network agreement with Du, the second-largest operator in the United Arab Emirates. The agreement involved co-operation on international clients, handset procurement, mobile broadband etc.[64]

Libya

On 24 February 2010, the group signed a partner network agreement with the second-largest operator in Libya, al Madar.[65]
Cameroon
On 23 September 2016, Vodafone extended its activities to Cameroon by signing a partnership with Afrimax, a 4G-LTE telecommunications operator in Africa. Vodafone Cameroon Launched a "Youth Program" in the Universities to support and encourage the Cameroonian students.[66]
The Americas[edit]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]
In December 2014, Vodafone announced an agreement with T-Mobile US to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service using its network, set to launch in 2015.[74]

On 17 March 2006, Vodafone announced an agreement to sell all its interest in Vodafone Japan to SoftBank for £8.9 billion, of which £6.8 billion will be received in cash on closing of deal.

A map showing the countries where Vodafone Global Enterprise has operations (coloured in red)


Vodafone Global Enterprise is the business services division, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group. It was established in April 2007 to provide telecommunications and information technology services to large corporations.[141][142][143]
The division offers integrated communication solutions in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.[141][142] Its services include domestic and international voice and data, machine-to-machine services, mobile email, mobile broadband, managed services, mobile payment and mobile recording.[144]
In December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company.[145] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within VGE,[40] working on cloud computing and professional services.[146]
Vodafone Global Enterprise operates in over 65 countries, with "Northern Europe" (based in London, United Kingdom), "Central Europe", "Southern Europe and Africa", "Asia Pacific & Sub-Saharan Africa" (based in Singapore) and "Americas" geographical divisions.[147] VGE's major customers include Deutsche Post,[148] The Linde Group,[149] Unilever,[150] and Volkswagen Group.[151]
Products and services[edit]

In October 2009, it launched Vodafone 360, a new internet service for the mobile, PC and Mac. This was discontinued in December 2011 after disappointing hardware sales.[152] This was after the Director of Internet Services resigned in September 2010 tweeting "5 days before I leave Vodafone. Freedom beckons."[153] In February 2010, Vodafone launched the world's cheapest mobile phone known as Vodafone 150, intended to sell for below $15 (£10) in the developing world. It was initially launched in India, Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho, Kenya and Ghana.[154]
Mobile money transfer services[edit]
In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

TECSOS – mobile phones have been adapted to allow victims of domestic violence to activate immediate contact with the emergency services if they are in danger
Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
Sir Gerald Whent, at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]




The headquarters of Vodafone Romania in Bucharest


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Egypt

In November 1998, the Vodafone Egypt network went live under the name ClickGSM.[49]
On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with Telecom Egypt, resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.[50]
On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

Kuwait

On 18 September 2002, Vodafone signed a Partner Network Agreement with MTC group of Kuwait. The agreement involved the rebranding of MTC to MTC-Vodafone. On 29 December 2003, Vodafone signed another Partner Network Agreement with Kuwait's MTC group. The second agreement involved co-operation in Bahrain and the branding of the network as MTC-Vodafone.[54]

South Africa (Vodacom)

On 3 November 2004, the Company announced that its South African affiliate Vodacom had agreed to introduce Vodafone's international services, such as Vodafone live! and partner agreements, to its local market.[55]
In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Ghana

On 3 July 2008, Vodafone agreed to acquire a 70% stake in Ghana Telecom for $900 million. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008. The same group-led consortium won the second fixed-line licence in Qatar on 15 September 2008.[62]
On 15 April 2009, Ghana Telecom, along with its mobile subsidiary OneTouch, was rebranded as Vodafone Ghana.[63]

U.A.E.

On 28 January 2009, the group announced a partner network agreement with Du, the second-largest operator in the United Arab Emirates. The agreement involved co-operation on international clients, handset procurement, mobile broadband etc.[64]

Libya

On 24 February 2010, the group signed a partner network agreement with the second-largest operator in Libya, al Madar.[65]
Cameroon
On 23 September 2016, Vodafone extended its activities to Cameroon by signing a partnership with Afrimax, a 4G-LTE telecommunications operator in Africa. Vodafone Cameroon Launched a "Youth Program" in the Universities to support and encourage the Cameroonian students.[66]
The Americas[edit]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]
In December 2014, Vodafone announced an agreement with T-Mobile US to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service using its network, set to launch in 2015.[74]

On 19 June 2009, Vodafone-Hutchison Australia (VHA) announced the end of its outsourcing of retail operations. VHA committed to buying back and managing its entire retail operation, including 208 Vodafone-branded retail outlets Australia-wide. This project was slated to be completed by 1 September 2009.[91]
On 31 August 2009, VHA enabled an extended 900 MHz 3G UMTS network which functions outside their 2,100 MHz 3G network, boosting Vodafone's 3G population coverage from around 8% to around 94% on dual-band 900/2,100 MHz 3G UMTS devices.[92]

At the beginning of September 2014, Vinaphone signed a strategic co-operation agreement with Vodafone.[98]
By late January 2017, Vodafone Group PLC's unit in India and Idea Cellular Ltd were in preliminary talks to merge.[99] And on 20 March 2017, Vodafone announced that it was merging its Indian business with Idea, India's third-largest network, to create the country's largest operator - with almost 400 million customers, accounting for 35% of the Indian cellphone service market.[100]
Vodafone would own 45.1 percent of the new operator and Idea's parent company, the Aditya Birla Group would own 26 percent. The deal valued Vodafone India at the equivalent of $12.6 billion and Idea Cellular at the equivalent of $11.02 billion. The deal would enable Vodafone to move its Indian subsidiary off its balance sheet, cutting the British group’s net debt by the equivalent of almost $8.25 billion.[101]

A map showing the countries where Vodafone Global Enterprise has operations (coloured in red)


Vodafone Global Enterprise is the business services division, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group. It was established in April 2007 to provide telecommunications and information technology services to large corporations.[141][142][143]
The division offers integrated communication solutions in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.[141][142] Its services include domestic and international voice and data, machine-to-machine services, mobile email, mobile broadband, managed services, mobile payment and mobile recording.[144]
In December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company.[145] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within VGE,[40] working on cloud computing and professional services.[146]
Vodafone Global Enterprise operates in over 65 countries, with "Northern Europe" (based in London, United Kingdom), "Central Europe", "Southern Europe and Africa", "Asia Pacific & Sub-Saharan Africa" (based in Singapore) and "Americas" geographical divisions.[147] VGE's major customers include Deutsche Post,[148] The Linde Group,[149] Unilever,[150] and Volkswagen Group.[151]
Products and services[edit]

In October 2009, it launched Vodafone 360, a new internet service for the mobile, PC and Mac. This was discontinued in December 2011 after disappointing hardware sales.[152] This was after the Director of Internet Services resigned in September 2010 tweeting "5 days before I leave Vodafone. Freedom beckons."[153] In February 2010, Vodafone launched the world's cheapest mobile phone known as Vodafone 150, intended to sell for below $15 (£10) in the developing world. It was initially launched in India, Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho, Kenya and Ghana.[154]
Mobile money transfer services[edit]
In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

TECSOS – mobile phones have been adapted to allow victims of domestic violence to activate immediate contact with the emergency services if they are in danger
Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
Sir Gerald Whent, at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]




The headquarters of Vodafone Romania in Bucharest


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Egypt

In November 1998, the Vodafone Egypt network went live under the name ClickGSM.[49]
On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with Telecom Egypt, resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.[50]
On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

Kuwait

On 18 September 2002, Vodafone signed a Partner Network Agreement with MTC group of Kuwait. The agreement involved the rebranding of MTC to MTC-Vodafone. On 29 December 2003, Vodafone signed another Partner Network Agreement with Kuwait's MTC group. The second agreement involved co-operation in Bahrain and the branding of the network as MTC-Vodafone.[54]

South Africa (Vodacom)

On 3 November 2004, the Company announced that its South African affiliate Vodacom had agreed to introduce Vodafone's international services, such as Vodafone live! and partner agreements, to its local market.[55]
In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Ghana

On 3 July 2008, Vodafone agreed to acquire a 70% stake in Ghana Telecom for $900 million. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008. The same group-led consortium won the second fixed-line licence in Qatar on 15 September 2008.[62]
On 15 April 2009, Ghana Telecom, along with its mobile subsidiary OneTouch, was rebranded as Vodafone Ghana.[63]

U.A.E.

On 28 January 2009, the group announced a partner network agreement with Du, the second-largest operator in the United Arab Emirates. The agreement involved co-operation on international clients, handset procurement, mobile broadband etc.[64]

Libya

On 24 February 2010, the group signed a partner network agreement with the second-largest operator in Libya, al Madar.[65]
Cameroon
On 23 September 2016, Vodafone extended its activities to Cameroon by signing a partnership with Afrimax, a 4G-LTE telecommunications operator in Africa. Vodafone Cameroon Launched a "Youth Program" in the Universities to support and encourage the Cameroonian students.[66]
The Americas[edit]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]
In December 2014, Vodafone announced an agreement with T-Mobile US to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service using its network, set to launch in 2015.[74]

In July 2014, Vodafone sold its 49% shareholding of Vodafone Fiji to The Fiji National Provident fund. Under the terms of the deal, Vodafone Fiji retained its branding under a Partner Market Agreement.[97]
At the beginning of September 2014, Vinaphone signed a strategic co-operation agreement with Vodafone.[98]
By late January 2017, Vodafone Group PLC's unit in India and Idea Cellular Ltd were in preliminary talks to merge.[99] And on 20 March 2017, Vodafone announced that it was merging its Indian business with Idea, India's third-largest network, to create the country's largest operator - with almost 400 million customers, accounting for 35% of the Indian cellphone service market.[100]
Vodafone would own 45.1 percent of the new operator and Idea's parent company, the Aditya Birla Group would own 26 percent. The deal valued Vodafone India at the equivalent of $12.6 billion and Idea Cellular at the equivalent of $11.02 billion. The deal would enable Vodafone to move its Indian subsidiary off its balance sheet, cutting the British group’s net debt by the equivalent of almost $8.25 billion.[101]

A map showing the countries where Vodafone Global Enterprise has operations (coloured in red)


Vodafone Global Enterprise is the business services division, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group. It was established in April 2007 to provide telecommunications and information technology services to large corporations.[141][142][143]
The division offers integrated communication solutions in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.[141][142] Its services include domestic and international voice and data, machine-to-machine services, mobile email, mobile broadband, managed services, mobile payment and mobile recording.[144]
In December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company.[145] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within VGE,[40] working on cloud computing and professional services.[146]
Vodafone Global Enterprise operates in over 65 countries, with "Northern Europe" (based in London, United Kingdom), "Central Europe", "Southern Europe and Africa", "Asia Pacific & Sub-Saharan Africa" (based in Singapore) and "Americas" geographical divisions.[147] VGE's major customers include Deutsche Post,[148] The Linde Group,[149] Unilever,[150] and Volkswagen Group.[151]
Products and services[edit]

In October 2009, it launched Vodafone 360, a new internet service for the mobile, PC and Mac. This was discontinued in December 2011 after disappointing hardware sales.[152] This was after the Director of Internet Services resigned in September 2010 tweeting "5 days before I leave Vodafone. Freedom beckons."[153] In February 2010, Vodafone launched the world's cheapest mobile phone known as Vodafone 150, intended to sell for below $15 (£10) in the developing world. It was initially launched in India, Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho, Kenya and Ghana.[154]
Mobile money transfer services[edit]
In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

TECSOS – mobile phones have been adapted to allow victims of domestic violence to activate immediate contact with the emergency services if they are in danger
Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
Sir Gerald Whent, at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Vodafone Group PLC (NASDAQ:VOD) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 5 Hold Ratings, 7 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.57)Consensus Price Target: $31.00 (5.30% upside)

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]




The headquarters of Vodafone Romania in Bucharest


On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]
Adverts[edit]
Since 2010, the adverts feature two bees named Jack and Mike. Other adverts feature Star Wars character Yoda. Idris Elba does voice over for adverts. In 2015, the new slogan, 'Live Life on 4G', was launched.[48]

Egypt

In November 1998, the Vodafone Egypt network went live under the name ClickGSM.[49]
On 8 November 2006, the company announced a deal with Telecom Egypt, resulting in further co-operation in the Egyptian market and increasing its stake in Vodafone Egypt. After the deal, Vodafone Egypt was 55% owned by the group, while the remaining 45% was owned by Telecom Egypt.[50]
On 28 January 2011, Vodafone complied with Egyptian government instructions to suspend Internet service "in selected areas" during a period of anti-Mubarak protests. The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

Kuwait

On 18 September 2002, Vodafone signed a Partner Network Agreement with MTC group of Kuwait. The agreement involved the rebranding of MTC to MTC-Vodafone.

On 3 November 2004, the Company announced that its South African affiliate Vodacom had agreed to introduce Vodafone's international services, such as Vodafone live! and partner agreements, to its local market.[55]
In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008. The agreement called for Telkom to sell 15 per cent of its 50 per cent stake in Vodacom to the group, and demerge the other 35 per cent to its shareholder. Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Ghana

On 3 July 2008, Vodafone agreed to acquire a 70% stake in Ghana Telecom for $900 million. The acquisition was consummated on 17 August 2008. The same group-led consortium won the second fixed-line licence in Qatar on 15 September 2008.[62]

The Americas[edit]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]
In December 2014, Vodafone announced an agreement with T-Mobile US to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service using its network, set to launch in 2015.[74]

On 4 April 2011, Vodafone sold its 44% stake in SFR, the second largest operator in France, to Vivendi for €7.95 billion.[137]
In March 2013, the Spanish operations of Vodafone signed an agreement with Orange S.A. to co-invest €1 billion in the expansion of Spain's fibre-optic cable broadband network. This will enable Vodafone to reach an additional 6 million customers in Spain by 2017.[138]
In October 2015 Russia's Mobile TeleSystems and Vodafone expanded their 2008 strategic partnership; this resulted in the rebranding of MTS Ukraine to Vodafone Ukraine.[139]
On 31 December 2016, Vodafone Group's Dutch operations merged with Liberty Global's Ziggo brand, creating VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V.[140]
Vodafone Global Enterprise[edit]

Vodafone Global Enterprise is the business services division, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Group. It was established in April 2007 to provide telecommunications and information technology services to large corporations.[141][142][143]
The division offers integrated communication solutions in cloud computing, unified communications and collaboration.[141][142] Its services include domestic and international voice and data, machine-to-machine services, mobile email, mobile broadband, managed services, mobile payment and mobile recording.[144]
In December 2011, it acquired the Reading-based Bluefish Communications Ltd, an ICT consultancy company.[145] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within VGE,[40] working on cloud computing and professional services.[146]
Vodafone Global Enterprise operates in over 65 countries, with "Northern Europe" (based in London, United Kingdom), "Central Europe", "Southern Europe and Africa", "Asia Pacific & Sub-Saharan Africa" (based in Singapore) and "Americas" geographical divisions.[147] VGE's major customers include Deutsche Post,[148] The Linde Group,[149] Unilever,[150] and Volkswagen Group.[151]
Products and services[edit]

In October 2009, it launched Vodafone 360, a new internet service for the mobile, PC and Mac. This was discontinued in December 2011 after disappointing hardware sales.[152] This was after the Director of Internet Services resigned in September 2010 tweeting "5 days before I leave Vodafone. Freedom beckons."[153] In February 2010, Vodafone launched the world's cheapest mobile phone known as Vodafone 150, intended to sell for below $15 (£10) in the developing world. It was initially launched in India, Turkey and eight African countries including Lesotho, Kenya and Ghana.[154]
Mobile money transfer services[edit]
In March 2007, Safaricom, which is part owned by Vodafone and the leading mobile communication provider in Kenya, launched a mobile payment solution developed by Vodafone.[155]
By February 2008, the M-PESA money transfer system in Kenya had gained 1.6 million customers.[156] By 2011 there were fourteen million M-Pesa accounts by which held 40 percent of the country's savings.[157] Following M-PESA's success in Kenya, Vodafone announced that it was to extend the service to Afghanistan.[158] The service here was launched on the Roshan network under the brand M-Paisa with a different focus to the Kenyan service. M-Paisa was targeted as a vehicle for microfinance institutions' (MFI) loan disbursements and repayments, alongside business-to-business applications such as salary disbursement. The Afghanistan launch was followed in April 2008 by the announcement of further a further launch of M-PESA in Tanzania, South Africa[159] and India.[160]
In February 2012, Vodafone announced a worldwide partnership with Visa.[161]
mHealth services[edit]
In November 2009, Vodafone announced the creation of a new business unit focused on the emerging mHealth market (the application of mobile communications and network technologies to healthcare).[162] One of its early success stories is with the Novartis-led "SMS for Life" project in Tanzania, for which Vodafone developed and deployed a text-message based system that enables all of the country's 4,600 public health facilities to report their levels of anti-malarial medications so that stock level data can be viewed centrally in real-time, enabling timely re-supply of stock. During the SMS for Life pilot, which covered 129 health facilities over six months, stock-outs dropped from 26% to 0.8%, saving thousands of lives.[163]
Vodafone Foundation[edit]
The Vodafone Foundation is a recognised charity which supports and initiates projects which use mobile technology to benefit the vulnerable, using the slogan "Connecting for Good".[164] They often work in collaboration with other charitable groups. Below are some examples of their initiatives:

TECSOS – mobile phones have been adapted to allow victims of domestic violence to activate immediate contact with the emergency services if they are in danger
Paediatric Epilepsy Remote Monitoring System – a monitoring system that allows physicians to remotely make patient observations
Safe Taxi System – an initiative in Portugal that consists of technology that taxi drivers can use to alert police if they are in danger of being assaulted
Learning with Vodafone Solution – technology that allows teachers in India to use graphical and multi-media content to enhance their teaching
The World of Difference programme – successful applicants choose charities for which they work either full-time for two months or part-time for four months (minimum 15 hours a week). The charities are provided with £2,500, with each winner receiving the balance as a salary after NI and tax have been paid.[165]

Corporate affairs[edit]

Senior management[edit]
Sir Gerald Whent, at that time an Executive with Racal Electronics plc, was responsible for the bid for a UK Cellular Network licence. The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, Racal was a diversified company, offering products including: voice loggers and data recorders; point of sale terminals; laboratory instruments; military electronics, including radio and radar. At its height, it operated throughout 110 countries worldwide and employed over 30,000 people. It was the parent company of Vodafone, before the mobile telephony provider was sold in 1991.
Racal was purchased by Thomson-CSF (now Thales Group) in 2000, thereby giving the French firm access to the lucrative UK defence and armaments market.

Foundation[edit]
Racal was created in 1950 as Racal Ltd, the name being derived from the partners RAymond Brown and George CALder Cunningham.[1]
Ernest Harrison joined the company as employee number 13 as an accountant,[2][3][4] but later held the positions of chief buyer, personnel director and contract negotiator.
The first factory was located in Isleworth, west London. On outgrowing this site it moved to Bracknell, Berkshire in 1954, enticed by a 99-year lease at four shillings and sixpence per square foot - and no rent reviews.[5]
Although Racal had won a Royal Navy contract to build and supply a variant of the American Collins Model 51-J Radio Receiver, they were not granted a licence to build these sets by Collins Inc. This meant that Racal had to design and build a radio receiver from scratch. After almost bankrupting the company due to a £40,000 overspend,[5] the result was the 'RA17' - in production from 1955 to at least 1973 - designed in cooperation with Trevor Wadley and utilising his Wadley Loop circuit.[6]
Racal under Harrison[edit]
Harrison joined the company board in 1958, and as deputy managing director from 1961 helped Racal to obtain a Stock Market listing.[3] Harrison became chairman in 1966, when co-founder Ray Brown was lured away by the Ministry of Defence.[3]
Major deals[edit]
[2]

Negotiation of a British Army battlefield radio contract (initially Larkspur, later part of Clansman) which secured the future of Racal
Led the merger between Racal and British Communications Corporation, that bolstered Racal’s radio business
Bought Decca in 1980 in competition from General Electric Company plc, the rival British company led by Lord Weinstock
Buying the British Rail Telecommunications network, to form the basis of Racal Telecom
Creation and spin-out of Vodafone
Stopping the proposed takeover by Williams Holdings by demerging Chubb
Investing in National Lottery company Camelot Group
Selling Racal Telecom to Global Crossing
Selling Racal's remaining defence and industrial electronics divisions to Thomson-CSF of France for £1.8 billion

Under Harrsion, £1,000 invested in Racal in 1961 would have been worth £14.5million when he retired in 2000. Harrison received an estimated £25 million from the sale of Racal in 2000, and is estimated to have died with an accumulated total wealth of £40million.[3]
Decca Radar[edit]
In 1979, Racal bought Decca Radar forming Racal-Decca. Racal-Datacom conducted business in the United States.[7]
Vodafone[edit]
Main article: Vodafone
In 1980, Harrison agreed a deal with Lord Weinstock of General Electric Company plc to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battlefield radio technology. Briefing the head of Racal's military radio division Gerry Whent to drive the company into commercial mobile radio, Whent visited GE's factory in Virginia, USA in 1980.[8]
In 1982, Racal's newly formed subsidiary Racal Strategic Radio Ltd under CEO Whent, won one of two UK cellular telephone network licences; the other going to British Telecom[9][10] The network, known as Racal Vodafone was 80% owned by Racal, with Millicom with 15%, and the Hambros Technology Trust 5% respectively. Vodafone was launched on January 1, 1985.[11] Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited in 1985.[10] On December 29, 1986, Racal Electronics bought out the minority shareholders of Vodafone for GB£110 million.[12]
In 1988, 20% of Racal Telecom was floated on the London Stock Exchange.[13] This would lead to the situation where Racal Electronics was valued at less than its shareholding in Racal Telecom. Harrison demerged Racal Telecom in October 1991, forcing a positive valuation on the rest of Racal (colloquially known in the City of London as "the rump"). Vodafone would later become the largest mobile network in the world and the highest valued company on the FTSE 100. Immediately following the demerger, Williams Holdings launched a takeover bid for Racal. The bid, valued at £740m, failed.[14]
Chubb Security[edit]
In 1984, Racal bought Chubb, a security company that manufactured safes and locks. In 1992, Chubb was demerged from Racal and was subsequently taken over by Willams Holdings in 1997 for £1.3bn.
Racal Telecoms[edit]
Racal re-established a telecoms division with a major government contract in 1988 and the acquisition of British Rail Telecommunications in 1995. This division of the former nationalised industry owned telecoms infrastructure laid across the rail network.
Racal Instrumentation[edit]
Consisted of Racal Recorders (Hythe, Southampton) and Racal Instruments (Burham, near Slough). Racal acquired Thermionic Products in 1967, creating Racal Thermionics, renamed Racal Recorders in 1977.
National Lottery[edit]
Main article: Camelot Group
In 1994, Camelot Group won the franchise to operate the UK National Lottery, Racal had a 22.5% share. After one of the founder shareholders, GTECH, was bought out by Camelot this stake increased to 26.67% which Thales continues to hold.[15]
Break-up[edit]
In 1995 Racal expanded its defence businesses with the acquisition of the Thorn Sensors Group from Thorn EMI.[16] In 1998 all of Racal defence businesses were reorganised under Racal Defence Electronics Ltd into Racal Radar Defence Systems, Racal Radio and Racal Thorn.
In October 1999 Racal decided to sell its telecoms business to the American communications group, Global Crossing, for £1bn.[17]
Then in January 2000 Thomson-CSF announced a bid for the Company: Racal became Thomson-CSF Racal plc and later part of Thales plc with the renaming of the larger Thomson-CSF to Thales Group.[18]
In December 2008, Racal Acoustics Ltd was acquired by Esterline Technologies, and has become part of their Communications Systems platform.

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]

Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]

In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]

The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008.

Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]

Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

VODAFONE STRENGTHENS ITS MANCHESTER UNITED SQUAD
 
With the opening game of the Premiership already

won, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer having scored and the new strip being worn with

pride, Manchester United and Vodafone can complete the great start to the

season for die-hard Reds fans with a range of new services.
 
Designed for those supporters who need to be on the

ball wherever they are, Man Utd on the Fone delivers all the up to

date news, via text messages straight to their Vodafone mobiles. By simply

dialling 17442 from their Vodafone mobiles fans can register for one of three

versions of the service, from the most simple giving goal alerts, the full time

score, signings and team sheet information to one which also highlights

penalties, red/yellow cards, news flashes and general ticket sales alerts.
 
For those United fans who like to personalise their

mobiles, Manchester United is also offering bespoke ringtones and logos for

mobile users on any network. Imagine having Glory, Glory, Man United as your

ringtone and a Red Devils logo on the screen.
 
In addition, there is the new Your Shout Service where

supporters have a chance to win the best seats at crucial games and even meet

their heroes, simply by registering their mobile numbers. They can also take

part in United competitions and opinion polls and a trivia quiz where a trip to

the United States to watch the Reds on tour in 2003 and meet the team can be

won.
 
All the new offerings are part of “MU NOW!”, Manchester

United’s  squad of information and

entertainment services delivered straight to fans’ mobiles, so wherever they

are they can keep in touch with the world’s favourite football team.
 
Vodafone, however, has not forgotten the fans of

other teams. Whether they support Arsenal, Exeter or Aberdeen, Footie on the

Fone will deliver half time and full time scores and goal by goal information

via text messages. Just dial 17442 from your Vodafone mobile to register.
 
“Vodafone is determined to give Manchester United fans

in particular and football fans in general exciting services for their mobile

phones,” says Lance Batchelor, Vodafone UK’s Marketing Director. “We are more

than just a name on United’s shirt. It’s a partnership between the world’s

favourite team and the world’s largest mobile community.”
 
“Manchester United are delighted that the association

with Vodafone is helping to bring news and entertainment directly to our fans,”

says Peter Kenyon, Manchester United’s Chief Executive. “We intend to develop

and enhance our range of services under the MU NOW! banner to meet the needs of

our fans wherever they are.”
 
Vodafone is in the third season of a £30m, four year

sponsorship deal with Manchester United.

Vodafone UK launches Vodafone m-pay cards —

the first UK Operator to Offer a Macro-Payment Service
 
Vodafone UK today announces the launch of Vodafone m-pay

cards.  This new payment service builds

on the success of the recently launched Vodafone m-pay bill micro-payment

facility to offer a macro-payment alternative. 

Vodafone m-pay cards enables consumers to quickly and easily pay for

goods online, over the Internet or WAP.
 
Vodafone m-pay cards is

a secure and easy-to-use payment solution for online goods and services bought

using credit or debit cards.  When a

customer registers for Vodafone m-pay cards, they enter their payment card

details once only.  These are held by

Vodafone in a secure central register and are automatically transferred to the

online merchant when required.
 
The once-only registration process eliminates the need

for customers to continually enter their full details. Once they have

registered for Vodafone m-pay cards, they need only enter their user name and

password to complete a transaction with the participating traders signed up to

the service.  As an added security

measure, a unique, one time password will be sent to the registered customers

mobile phone via SMS, which needs to be entered into the site to authorise the

transaction.
 
“Since Vodafone UK first introduced mobile payments

via text messaging in March 1996, it has continued to take a lead in the

innovation and pioneering of m-services,” said Gavin Darby, Chief Operating

Officer at Vodafone UK.  “Vodafone

demonstrated its commitment to evolving its m-commerce capabilities with the

launch of Vodafone m-pay bill in February 2002.  The latest offering - Vodafone m-pay cards, serves to further

enhance the service we offer to our customers.   Anything that simplifies the purchasing process will ensure that

merchants convert many more of their potential transactions into actual

purchases.”
 
“Many of the barriers to online commerce have been

broken down,” said Jim Wadsworth, head of m-commerce, Vodafone UK.  “Our customers no longer need to spend time

filling in lengthy forms with their credit or debit card number, expiry date

etc. When they want to buy something online, once they’re registered it’s just

a matter of entering their user name and password and they’re away!”
 
Companies currently signed up to the service include

Odeon Cinemas, CD-Wow, Blushing Buyer, Friends Reunited, Just Champagne, Way

Ahead and a number of other online traders.  

Vodafone UK is continually signing up additional traders to further

extend the m-pay cards offering.  Many

of these traders will offer exclusive deals for Vodafone m-pay cards customers

— an added incentive to pay via Vodafone m-pay cards.
 
Vodafone m-pay cards is available as a payment service

for any Vodafone UK mobile phone owner who possesses a credit or debit

card.   Customers are able to register

for the service at www.vodafone.co.uk/mpay-cards.  When registered, Vodafone UK customers will

be able to use the service when they are online, over the Internet or their WAP

phone, by simply clicking onto the Vodafone m-pay cards link.

SCOTTISH AMBULANCE SERVICE SIGNS UP FOR
VODAFONE GPRS DATA SOLUTION
 
The Scottish Ambulance Service has implemented the

Terrafix Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) system utilising Vodafone UK’s

comprehensive GPRS mobile data network. The service’s frontline of 452

emergency vehicles has been rolled out with the AVL system since August 2002,

allowing their Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres to update the position of

vehicles across the entire Scottish landmass every 13 seconds.


The Vodafone GPRS data network was chosen by Terrafix partly for its extensive

UK coverage, which incorporates all the remote Highlands and Islands within

Scotland*. The solution also comprises a cost-effective price plan to

accommodate the high data rate required by the Scottish Ambulance Service,

making efficient use of the ‘always-on’ nature of GPRS network connections.
 
The Scottish Ambulance Service selected specialist

solutions provider Terrafix to implement the new AVL system. Each vehicle will

be equipped with a Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver, which

integrates with the new Terrafix Intelligence Interface Unit. Following the

initial roll out, it is expected that the solution will expand to cover all

1100 vehicles in both the emergency and non-emergency services.
 
The use of the Vodafone GPRS data network creates a

first for the Service by ensuring that vehicles can be tracked throughout the

entire operational

area, helping it to improve the service for patients. The successful use of new

mobile data services on this scale will also allow other emergency services in

the UK to explore the benefits that can be derived from cost-effective

high-speed tracking.
 
Stevan Hoyle, Corporate Director and General Manager,

Vodafone UK, adds: “This is a perfect example of an organisation making highly

effective and cost-efficient use of the capabilities of our GPRS network. We

are very pleased to be involved in building an advanced mobile data solution

that plays such a significant role in Scotland.”
 
*The Vodafone UK GSM and GPRS network currently covers

99% of the UK population

VODAFONE EUROCALL PLATINUM — GREATER VALUE

FOR ROAMING CUSTOMERS
 
Vodafone Group Plc (“Vodafone”) today announces the

launch of Eurocall Platinum, a new Eurocall option which has been developed to

help reduce the cost of calls for high volume roaming customers.  Eurocall Platinum builds on the success of

Eurocall, Vodafone’s single rate European price plan, launched in January 2001.
 
Customers pay a monthly fee up to €10, which gives

them access to a maximum flat roaming rate of €0.65 per minute.  The rate applies to Vodafone partner network

customers who originate calls when roaming to any country within Western Europe1. The existing basic Eurocall

tariff rate is currently charged at a maximum of €0.80, when the participating

Vodafone partner network is used.
 
Vodafone customers in Germany, Greece, Ireland,

Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and Sweden will today be able to register for

Eurocall Platinum.  The service will be

extended to SFR customers in France from 15 October 2002 and to Vodafone UK

customers by 1 November 2002.
 
The Eurocall Platinum option comes with a free

upgrade to an assisted roaming SIM which automatically seeks to connect

customers to the local Vodafone partner network.  The Eurocall Platinum price, like Eurocall, will be single rate

and have no peak and off-peak periods.
 
Thomas Geitner, Chief Executive, Vodafone Global

Products & Services, commented: “The launch of Eurocall Platinum is a

further example of Vodafone’s ability to deliver European services that

directly benefit our customers.  Through

Eurocall Platinum, customers who are frequent users of our roaming services

will now be able to stay in touch across Europe at even better prices.”

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]

Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]

In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]

The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008.

Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]

The Mobile Telecoms division was de-merged, and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 1988 and Sir Gerald became Chief Executive of Racal Telecom plc. Over the next few years the company grew to become the UK's Market Leader, changing its name to Vodafone Group plc in the process.[166]
Sir Christopher Gent took over as Chief Executive in January 1997, after Sir Gerald's retirement. Gent was responsible for transforming Vodafone from a small UK operator into the global operator, through the merger with the American AirTouch and the takeover of Germany's Mannesmann.[167]
Arun Sarin was the driving force behind the Company's move into emerging markets such as Asia and Africa, through the purchases such as that of Turkish operator Telsim, and a majority stake in Hutchison Essar in India.[168]
The fourth CEO, Vittorio Colao, stepped up from Deputy Chief Executive in July 2008.[169]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]
Vodafone Group plc: 2000 to present[edit]

On 28 July 2000, the Company reverted to its former name, Vodafone Group plc.[33]
In 2001, the Company acquired Eircell, the largest wireless communications company in Ireland, from eircom.[34] Eircell was subsequently rebranded as Vodafone Ireland. Vodafone then went on to acquire Japan's third-largest mobile operator J-Phone, which had introduced camera phones first in Japan.[35]
On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]
In 2007, Vodafone entered into a title sponsorship deal with the McLaren Formula One team, which traded as "Vodafone McLaren Mercedes" until the sponsorship ended at the end of the 2013 season.[37][38]
In May 2011, Vodafone Group Plc bought the remaining shares of Vodafone Essar from Essar Group Ltd for $5 billion.[39]
On 1 December 2011, it acquired the Reading based Bluefish Communications Ltd – an ICT consultancy company.[40] The acquired operations formed the nucleus of a new Unified Communications and Collaboration practice within its subsidiary – Vodafone Global Enterprise,[40] which will focus on implementing strategies and solutions in cloud computing, and strengthen its professional services offering.[40]
In April 2012, Vodafone announced an agreement to acquire Cable & Wireless Worldwide (CWW) for £1.04 billion.[41] Vodafone was advised by UBS AG, while Barclays and Rothschild advised Cable & Wireless.[41] The acquisition will give Vodafone access to CWW's fibre network for businesses, enabling it to take unified communications solutions to large enterprises in UK and globally; and expand its enterprise service offerings in emerging markets. On 18 June 2012, Cable & Wireless' shareholders voted in favour of the Vodafone offer, exceeding the 75% of shares necessary for the deal to go ahead.[42][43]
On 24 June 2013, Vodafone announced it would be buying German cable company Kabel Deutschland. The takeover is valued at €7.7 billion, and was recommended over the bid of rival Liberty Global.[44]
On 2 September 2013, Vodafone announced it would be selling its 45% stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications for $US130 billion, in one of the biggest deals in corporate history.[45]
In October 2013, Vodafone began its rollout of 4G to provincial New Zealand, with the launch of the system in holiday hotspots around Coromandel.[46]
In February 2014, Vodafone made an offer to acquire Spain's largest cable operator, ONO, in a deal rumoured to be around €7 billion.[47]

The company issued a statement that "Under Egyptian legislation, the authorities have the right to issue such an order and we are obliged to comply with it."[51][52]
Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests. One such message requested that "honest and loyal men" should "confront the traitors and criminals". Vodafone later issued a statement asserting that they had no choice but to allow the messages to be broadcast, and that they had complained to the Egyptian authorities about the practice.[53]

In November 2005, Vodafone announced that it was in exclusive talks to buy a 15% stake of VenFin in Vodacom Group, reaching agreement the following day. Vodafone and Telkom then had a 50% stake each in Vodacom. Vodafone now owns 57.5% of Vodacom after purchasing a 15% stake from Telkom.[56]
On 9 October 2008, the company offered to acquire an additional 15 per cent stake in Vodacom Group from Telkom. The finalised details of the agreement were announced on 6 November 2008.

Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Chile

On 11 May 2008, Vodafone sealed a trade agreement with the Chilean Entel PCS Chile, in which Entel PCS has access to the equipment and international services of Vodafone, and Vodafone will be one of the trademarks of Entel for the wireless business. This step will give the Vodafone brand access to a market of over 15 million people, currently divided among two companies: Telefonica Movistar, and Entel PCS.[67]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]
In 2013, Vodafone was considered for acquisition by U.S. based AT&T.[71][72] Ultimately, the deal did not move forward.[73]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]

Name[edit]
The name Vodafone comes from voice data fone (the latter a sensational spelling of "phone"), chosen by the company to "reflect the provision of voice and data services over mobile phones".[7]
History[edit]
The evolution of Vodafone started in 1982 with the establishment of the Racal Strategic Radio Ltd subsidiary of Racal Electronics, the UK's largest maker of military radio technology, which formed a joint venture with Millicom called 'Racal', which evolved into the present day Vodafone.[8][9][10]
Evolution as a Racal Telecom brand: 1980 to 1991[edit]




Vodafone's original logo, used from 1991 to 1997


In 1980, Sir Ernest Harrison OBE, the then chairman of Racal Electronics, agreed to a deal with Lord Weinstock of the General Electric Company to allow Racal to access some of GEC's tactical battle field radio technology. The head of Racal's military radio division, Gerry Whent, was briefed by Ernest Harrison to drive the company into commercial mobile radio. Whent visited a mobile radio factory run by General Electric (unrelated to GEC) in Virginia, USA the same year to understand the commercial use of military radio technology.[11]
Jan Stenbeck, head of a growing Swedish conglomerate, set up an American company, Millicom, Inc. and approached Racal's Whent in July 1982 about bidding jointly for the UK's second cellular radio licence. The two struck a deal giving Racal 60% of the new company, Racal-Millicom, Ltd, and Millicom 40%. Due to UK concerns about foreign ownership, the terms were revised, and in December 1982, the Racal-Milicom partnership was awarded the second UK mobile phone network license.[12] Final ownership of Racal-Millicom, Ltd was 80% Racal, with Millicom holding 15% plus royalties and venture firm Hambros Technology Trust holding 5%. According to the UK Secretary of State for Industry, "the bid submitted by Racal-Millicom Ltd… provided the best prospect for early national coverage by cellular radio."[13]
Vodafone was launched on 1 January 1985 under the new name, Racal-Vodafone (Holdings) Ltd,[14] with its first office based in the Courtyard in Newbury, Berkshire, and[15] shortly thereafter Racal Strategic Radio was renamed Racal Telecommunications Group Limited.[16] On 29 December 1986, Racal Electronics issued shares to the minority shareholders of Vodafone worth GB£110 million, and Vodafone became a fully owned brand of Racal.[17]
On 26 October 1988, Racal Telecom, majority held by Racal Electronics, went public on the London Stock Exchange with 20% of its stock floated. The successful flotation led to a situation where Racal's stake in Racal Telecom was valued more than the whole of Racal Electronics. Under stock market pressure to realise full value for shareholders, Racal demerged Racal Telecom in 1991.[18][19]
Vodafone Group, then Vodafone Airtouch plc: 1991 to 2000[edit]
On 16 September 1991, Racal Telecom was demerged from Racal Electronics as Vodafone Group, with Gerry Whent as its CEO.[20]
In July 1996, Vodafone acquired the two-thirds of Talkland it did not already own for £30.6 million.[21] On 19 November 1996, in a defensive move, Vodafone purchased Peoples Phone for £77 million, a 181 store chain whose customers were overwhelmingly using Vodafone's network.[22] In a similar move the company acquired the 80% of Astec Communications that it did not own, a service provider with 21 stores.[23]
In January 1997, Gerald Whent retired and Christopher Gent took over as the CEO. The same year, Vodafone introduced its Speechmark logo, composed of a quotation mark in a circle, with the O's in the Vodafone logotype representing opening and closing quotation marks and suggesting conversation.[24]
On 29 June 1999, Vodafone completed its purchase of AirTouch Communications, Inc. and changed its name to Vodafone Airtouch plc. The merged company commenced trading on 30 June 1999.[25] To gain anti-trust approval for the merger, Vodafone sold its 17.2% stake in E-Plus Mobilfunk.[26] The acquisition gave Vodafone a 35% share of Mannesmann, owner of the largest German mobile network.[27]
On 21 September 1999, Vodafone agreed to merge its US wireless assets with those of Bell Atlantic Corp to form Verizon Wireless.[28] The merger was completed on 4 April 2000, just a few months prior to Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE to form Verizon Communications, Inc.[29]
In November 1999, Vodafone made an unsolicited bid for Mannesmann, which was rejected. Vodafone's interest in Mannesmann had been increased by the latter purchase of Orange, the UK mobile operator.[30] Chris Gent would later say Mannesmann's move into the UK broke a "gentleman's agreement" not to compete in each other's home territory.[31] The hostile takeover provoked strong protest in Germany, and a "titanic struggle" which saw Mannesmann resist Vodafone's efforts. However, on 3 February 2000, the Mannesmann board agreed to an increased offer of £112 billion, then the largest corporate merger ever.[31] The EU approved the merger in April 2000 when Vodafone agreed to divest the 'Orange' brand, which was acquired in May 2000 by France Télécom.[32]

On 17 December 2001, Vodafone introduced the concept of "Partner Networks", by signing TDC Mobil of Denmark. The new concept involved the introduction of Vodafone international services to the local market, without the need of investment by Vodafone. The concept would be used to extend the Vodafone brand and services into markets where it does not have stakes in local operators. Vodafone services would be marketed under the dual-brand scheme, where the Vodafone brand is added at the end of the local brand. (i.e., TDC Mobil-Vodafone etc.)[36]

Vodafone also received public and media criticism for allowing the authorities to send mass pro-government messages via SMS over their network during the protests.

Meanwhile, Vodafone has agreed to make Vodacom its exclusive sub-Saharan Africa investment vehicle, as well as continuing to maintain the visibility of the Vodacom brand. The transaction closed in May/June 2009.[57]
On 18 May 2009, Vodacom entered the JSE Limited stock exchange in South Africa after Vodafone increased its stake by 15% to 65% to take a majority holding, despite disputes by local trade unions.[58]
In April 2011, Vodacom rebranded with the Vodafone logo.[59]

Qatar

In December 2007, a Vodafone Group-led consortium was awarded the second mobile phone licence in Qatar under the name "Vodafone Qatar". Vodafone Qatar is located at QSTP, the Qatar Science & Technology Park.[60] Commercial operations officially began on 1 March 2009.[61]

Brazil

In August 2013, Vodafone has started the MVNO operation in Brazil, as a corporative M2M operator.[68]

United States

In the United States, Vodafone previously owned 45% of Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Verizon Communications, the country's largest mobile carrier. Vodafone branding was not used, however, as the CDMA network was not compatible with the GSM 900/1800 MHz standard used by Vodafone's other networks and as Vodafone did not have management control over Verizon Wireless. On 2 September 2013 Vodafone announced the sale of its stake to Verizon Communications for around $130 billion.[69]
In 2004 Vodafone made an unsuccessful bid for the entirety of AT&T Wireless, however, (Cingular Wireless) at the time a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth (both now part of AT&T Inc.), ultimately outbid Vodafone and took control of AT&T Wireless (the combined wireless carrier is now AT&T Mobility).[70]

Criticisms[edit]




UK Uncut protestors outside a Vodafone shop in Liverpool.


Tax Avoidance[edit]
In September 2010, an investigation by Private Eye magazine revealed certain details of Vodafone's tax avoidance activities. It was reported that Vodafone routed the acquisition of Mannesmann through a Luxembourg subsidiary, set up to avoid paying tax on the deal, and continued to place its profits in Luxembourg. Following a long legal struggle with HMRC (during which a senior HMRC official, John Connors, switched sides to become head of tax at Vodafone), it was eventually agreed that Vodafone would pay £1.25 billion related to the acquisition. Based on Vodafone's accounts, experts have estimated the potential tax bill written off as a result of the negotiations was over £6 billion.[170]
The news of this legal tax avoidance sparked angry protests, beginning in October 2010 and ongoing as of April 2011, outside Vodafone shops across the UK, organised under the banner of UK Uncut. The first protests caused the simultaneous closure of over a dozen stores, including the flagship Oxford Street branch.[171]
In 2011, Private Eye magazine and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism alleged that Vodafone's Swiss branches were run by a single part-time bookkeeper. The report claimed hardly any business was done from there, indicating that the main purpose of the Zug office was tax avoidance. The report claimed the money was borrowed from the Swiss branch of the Luxembourg company, allowing it to take advantage of Luxembourg's laws, which exempts foreign branches of companies from tax, and Swiss laws, which almost completely exempt local branches of foreign companies. According to the expose, this would have otherwise generated a British tax bill on a little over £2 billion. It said Vodafone publishes a single, combined set of accounts for its Luxembourg subsidiaries and their Swiss branches. For the one company, profits worth £1.6 billion were taxed at less than 1% in 2011, and the profits are likely to have been attributed to Switzerland. In its response to these allegations, Vodafone has said the Swiss branch has not been involved in Vodafone's global financing for a number of years. It is, therefore, irrelevant in respect to global financing arrangements.[172]
Vodafone was also assessed a US$2.5 billion tax over its acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa's Indian assets in 2007, a demand that it contests. In January 2012, the highest Indian court ruled that Vodafone is not liable for taxes and penalties of up to £2.8 billion.[173][174] However, in February 2016 India's tax department sent Vodafone a renewed tax notice of £1.4bn. Following the siding of the Indian court with Vodafone in 2012, the government changed the law to allow firms to be retrospectively taxed.[175]
Communications blackout during the Arab Spring[edit]
Vodafone was implicated in the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests in Egypt's 2011 demonstrations. On 27 January, Vodafone, responsible for much of Egypt's telecommunication infrastructure, shut off all voice and data services for Egyptian citizens and businesses at the request of the Egyptian Government under Hosni Mubarak.[176] The Daily Telegraph of the UK reported, "The Egyptian government's action is unprecedented in the history of the internet."[177] US-based Internet intelligence firm Renesys stated, "in an action unprecedented in Internet history, the Egyptian government appears to have ordered service providers to shut down all international connections to the Internet."[178] Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao said the company was obliged by law to comply with the instructions of the Egyptian government.[179] At the company's annual general meeting, on 26 June, the campaign groups Access and FairPensions asked Vodafone to endorse a plan to prevent the company facing similar demands in the future.[180][181]
Poor customer service[edit]
In Australia, particularly towards the end of 2010, Vodafone have been heavily criticised due to allegations of poor customer service and severe technical inadequacies, which earned them their nickname "Vodafail" – a website of the same name still exists.[182] In response, they have developed a "new" network, and now provide a 30-day satisfaction guarantee.[183]
Unlimited roaming costs on stolen phones[edit]
Vodafone UK, in common with other operators, has been criticised for holding customers on regular monthly billed contracts liable for almost unlimited roaming costs when their phones are stolen abroad, despite being seemingly able to limit costs of pay-as-you-go contracts.[184]
Breaches of consumer protection rules[edit]
In October 2016, Vodafone was fined a record £4.6m by Ofcom for "serious" breaches of consumer protection rules.[185] In April 2017, Vodafone continued to have major issues with customer service, with the CEO Nick Jeffery inviting customers with unresolved complaints to email him directly.[186]
Surveillance infrastructure[edit]
In June 2014, Vodafone revealed information about theirs and other telecommunication operators' 'direct access systems', content data and metadata interception programmes globally.[187]
