Radiology / Diagnostic Radiology  click for detail Diagnostic Radiology A radiologist who utilizes x-ray, radionuclides, ultrasound and electromagnetic radiation to diagnose and treat disease.A23741CaliforniaAllopathic & Osteopathic Physicians / Nuclear Medicine  click for detail Nuclear Medicine A nuclear medicine specialist employs the properties of radioactive atoms and molecules in the diagnosis and treatment of disease and in research. Radiation detection and imaging instrument systems are used to detect disease as it changes the function and metabolism of normal cells, tissues and organs. A wide variety of diseases can be found in this way, usually before the structure of the organ involved by the disease can be seen to be abnormal by any other techniques. Early detection of coronary artery disease (including acute heart attack), early cancer detection and evaluation of the effect of tumor treatment, diagnosis of infection and inflammation anywhere in the body and early detection of blood clot in the lungs are all possible with these techniques. Unique forms of radioactive molecules can attack and kill cancer cells (e.g., lymphoma, thyroid cancer) or can relieve the severe pain of cancer that has spread to boneA23741California

 Educational Background



BSc in Mining Engineering 
Class of 1990 


Queen’s University

                  Queen's University at Kingston (commonly shortened to Queen's University or Queen's) is a public research university located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Founded on 16 October 1841, the university predated the founding of Canada by 26 years. Queen's holds more than 1,400 hectares (3,500 acres) of land throughout Ontario and owns Herstmonceux Castle in East Sussex, England. Queen's is organized into ten undergraduate, graduate and professional faculties and schools.

The Church of Scotland established Queen's College in 1841 with a royal charter from Queen Victoria. The first classes, intended to prepare students for the ministry, were held 7 March 1842 with 13 students and two professors. Queen's was the first university west of the maritime provinces to admit women, and to form a student government. In 1883, a women's college for medical education affiliated with Queen's University. In 1888, Queen's University began offering extension courses, becoming the first Canadian university to do so. In 1912, Queen's secularized and changed to its present legal name.

Richard Bustos














 Richard Bustos 
 Design Consultant 
 Days off: Thursday & Friday  
 rbustos@cantoni.com

Richard has applied his clean-lined, elegant spin to residential and commercial projects spanning hi-rise condos, stylish lofts, lavish estates, extravagant vacation homes and upscale corporate offices around the globe. His spaces convey readily apparent moods with effortless flow: he favors textural upholstery and rugs, well-appointed accessories, and art. “My approach toward design is much like my personality: easygoing, fun, uncomplicated,” he says. “Aesthetics and functionality are key, and the design should be long-lasting.”  Richard has more than two decades of design experience. He joined Cantoni in 2001, and frequently draws inspiration from our company’s ever-evolving portfolio. “I’m literally surrounded by great design every day,” he says. He applies his excitement toward creating unique spaces that are a reflection of his clients’ personalities. “I work to understand their tastes, needs, how they live and what they are passionate about, and translate these into beautiful surroundings that inspire them,” he says. “I love bringing their visions to life.”  An LA native and father of three, Richard loves a good reason to don one of his Hugo Boss suits and a tie. “I don’t get to wear them often, but when I do, it’s a treat,” he says, adding that nothing is more exciting than a visit to a museum or theatrical production. “The visual aspect, set design, storyline, emotion – it helps me stay creative and inspired.” 




Get to know Richard: What’s your favorite libation? A great glass of cabernet. Where do you like to go to get away? New York City for the energy, excitement and creativity. Hawaii for the rest and relaxation. How do you describe your design style? Simple, clean, and just the right amount of sophistication. What do you do with your downtime? Practice yoga, which keeps me centered and focused, and spend time with my wife and children. What’s your favorite cuisine? Mexican. I could eat it every day.

Now, I love my beautiful home and it’s all because of him. — Karen Swenson, Orange County     Richard proved to be a fantastic collaborator and excelled in space planning and design. He helped us create the look we wanted for our waterfront home. We were so impressed with our overall experience from Richard’s knowledge to Cantoni’s customer service and super-reliable delivery schedule. — J. Stansfield, Huntington Beach     Richard has staged and furnished over 20 properties for my development firm.
