MARQIBO- vincristine sulfateTalon Therapeutics, Inc.
  WARNING   •  For Intravenous Use Only – Fatal if Given by Other Routes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ].  •  Death has occurred with intrathecal administration.  •  Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) has different dosage recommendations than vinCRIStine sulfate injection.  Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid overdosage.  1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1.1 Adult ALL in Second or Greater Relapse 



Marqibo® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. This indication is based on overall response rate. Clinical benefit such as improvement in overall survival has not been verified.
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATIONFor Intravenous Use Only. Fatal if Given by Other Routes.
Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) has different dosage recommendations than vincristine sulfate injection. Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid overdosage.
2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of Marqibo is 2.25 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour once every 7 days.
Marqibo is liposome-encapsulated vincristine.
2.2 Dose modifications: Peripheral Neuropathy Marqibo is contraindicated in patients with demyelinating conditions including Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome [see Contraindications (4) ]. Patients with preexisting severe neuropathy should be treated with Marqibo only after careful risk-benefit assessment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. For dose or schedule modifications guidelines for patients who experience peripheral neuropathy, see Table 1.   Table 1 Recommended Dose Modifications for Marqibo-related Peripheral Neuropathy       Severity of Peripheral Neuropathy Signs and Symptoms *   Modification of Dose and Regimen         *  Grading based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v3.0.  †  Self-care ADL:  refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  ‡  Instrumental ADL:  refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries and clothes, using telephone, managing money, etc.       If the patient develops Grade 3 (severe symptoms; limiting self-care activities of daily living [ADL]†) or persistent Grade 2 (moderate symptoms; limiting instrumental ADL ‡) peripheral neuropathy:
  Interrupt Marqibo.
If the peripheral neuropathy remains at Grade 3 or 4, discontinue Marqibo.
If the peripheral neuropathy recovers to Grade 1 or 2, reduce the Marqibo dose to 2 mg/m2.
    If the patient has persistent Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy after the first dose reduction to 2 mg/m2:
  Interrupt Marqibo for up to 7 days.
If the peripheral neuropathy increases to Grade 3 or 4, discontinue Marqibo.
If peripheral neuropathy recovers to Grade 1, reduce the Marqibo dose to 1.825 mg/m2.
    If the patient has persistent Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy after the second dose reduction to 1.825 mg/m2:
  Interrupt Marqibo for up to 7 days.
If the peripheral neuropathy increases to Grade 3 or 4, discontinue Marqibo.
If the toxicity recovers to Grade 1, reduce the Marqibo dose to 1.5 mg/m2.
   2.3 Preparation and Handling     2.3.1 Items Required by the Pharmacy to Prepare Marqibo   • Marqibo Kit •  Water bath 1  or block heater 2  •  Calibrated thermometer1 (0°C to 100°C)  •  Calibrated electronic timer1   • Sterile venting needle or other suitable device equipped with a sterile 0.2 micron filter • 1 mL or 3 mL sterile syringe with needle, and  • 5 mL sterile syringe with needle. •  Tongs 3     1   The manufacturer will provide the water bath, calibrated thermometer, and calibrated electronic timer to the medical facility at the initial order of Marqibo and will replace them every 2 years.  2   The manufacturer will provide the block heater to the medical facility at the initial order of Marqibo. The block heater will be replaced every 5 years.  3   The manufacturer will provide tongs to the medical facility at the initial order of Marqibo. 2.3.2 Preparation Instructions for Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection), 5 mg/31 mL (0.16 mg/mL) Procedures for handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be followed [see References (15) ].
Call [1 888 292 9617] if you have questions about the preparation of Marqibo. Marqibo takes approximately 60 to 90 minutes to prepare. The preparer should have dedicated uninterrupted time to prepare Marqibo due to the extensive monitoring of temperature and time required for the preparation.
Aseptic technique must be strictly observed since no preservative or bacteriostatic agent is present in Marqibo. The preparation steps of Marqibo that involve mixing the Sodium Phosphate Injection, Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection, and VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection must be done in a biological safety cabinet or by established pharmacy safety procedures for the preparation of sterile injectable formulations and hazardous drugs. However, the preparation steps that involve placement of the vial in the water bath must be done outside of the sterile area.
Do not use with in-line filters. Do not mix with other drugs.
​Water bath process:
1.Fill a water bath with water to a level of at least 8 cm (3.2 inches) measured from the bottom and maintain this minimum water level throughout the procedure. The water bath must remain outside of the sterile area.2.Place a calibrated thermometer in the water bath to monitor water temperature and leave it in the water bath until the procedure has been completed.3.Preheat water bath to 63°C to 67°C. Maintain this water temperature until completion of the procedure using the calibrated thermometer.4.Visually inspect each vial in the Marqibo Kit for particulate matter and discoloration prior to preparation, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present.5.Remove all the caps on the vials and swab the vials with sterile alcohol pads.6.Vent the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial with a sterile venting needle equipped with a sterile 0.2 micron filter or other suitable venting device in the biological safety cabinet. Always position venting needle point well above liquid level before adding Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection and VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection.7.Withdraw 1 mL of Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection.8.Inject 1 mL of Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection into the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial.9.Withdraw 5 mL of VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection.10.Inject 5 mL of VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection into the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial.11.Remove the venting needle and gently invert the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial 5 times to mix. DO NOT SHAKE.12.Fit Flotation Ring around the neck of the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial.13.Confirm that the water bath temperature is at 63°C to 67°C using the calibrated thermometer. Remove the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial containing VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection, Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection, and Sodium Phosphate Injection from the biological safety cabinet and place into the water bath for 10 minutes using the calibrated electronic timer. Monitor the temperature to ensure the temperature is maintained at 63°C to 67°C.14.IMMEDIATELY after placing the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial into the water bath, record the constitution start time and water temperature on the Marqibo Overlabel.15.At the end of the 10 minutes using the water bath, confirm that the water temperature is 63°C to 67°C using the calibrated thermometer. Remove the vial from the water bath (use tongs to prevent burns) and remove the Flotation Ring.16.Record the final constitution time and the water temperature on the Marqibo Overlabel.17.Dry the exterior of the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial with a clean paper towel, affix Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) Overlabel, and gently invert 5 times to mix. DO NOT SHAKE.18.Permit the constituted vial contents to equilibrate for at least 30 minutes to controlled room temperature (15°C to 30°C, 59°F to 86°F).19.Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) contains 5 mg/31 mL (0.16 mg/mL) vincristine sulfate. ONCE PREPARED, STORE AT CONTROLLED ROOM TEMPERATURE (15°C to 30°C, 59°F to 86°F) FOR NO MORE THAN 12 HOURS.20.Swab the top of the vial now containing Marqibo with a sterile alcohol pad and return the vial back into the biological safety cabinet.21.Calculate the patient’s Marqibo dose based on the patient’s actual body surface area (BSA) and remove the volume corresponding to the patient’s Marqibo dose from an infusion bag containing 100 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection.22.Inject the dose of Marqibo into the infusion bag to result in a final volume of 100 mL.23.Complete the information required on the Infusion Bag Label and apply to the infusion bag.24.Finish administration of the diluted product within 12 hours of the initiation of Marqibo preparation.25.Empty, clean, and dry the water bath after each use.26.Deviations in temperature, time, and preparation procedures may fail to ensure proper encapsulation of vincristine sulfate into the liposomes. In the event that the preparation deviates from the instructions in the above steps, the components of the kit should be discarded and a new kit should be used to prepare the dose.Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present.
​Block heater process:
​Note: Do NOT use water with the block heater preparation process. 
​Note: The flotation ring included with the Marqibo kit is not required for the block heater application.
1.Arrange the three heater blocks in the block heater such that the block holding the constitution vial is centered between the two other blank heater blocks. (See the illustration below.)​2.Place a calibrated thermometer in the block opening adjacent to the vial well to monitor the temperature. Leave the thermometer in the block opening until the procedure has been completed.3.Turn on the block heater and set the controller to 75°C. Verify the block temperature by checking that the thermometer inserted in the block reads 75 ±2°C. Equilibrate the heating block at 75 ±2°C for 15 minutes. Maintain this block temperature until completion of the procedure using the calibrated thermometer.4.Visually inspect each vial in the Marqibo Kit for particulate matter and discoloration prior to preparation, whenever solution and container permit. Do not use if a precipitate or foreign matter is present.5.Remove all the caps on the vials and swab the vials with sterile alcohol pads.6.Vent the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial with a sterile venting needle equipped with a sterile 0.2 micron filter or other suitable venting device in the biological safety cabinet. Always position venting needle point well above liquid level before adding Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection and VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection.7.Withdraw 1 mL of Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection.8.Inject 1 mL of Sphingomyelin/Cholesterol Liposome Injection into the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial.9.Withdraw 5 mL of VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection.10.Inject 5 mL of VinCRIStine Sulfate Injection into the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial.11.Remove the venting needle and gently invert the Sodium Phosphate Injection vial 5 times to mix.

In addition, its development stage product consists of Alocrest (vinorelbine liposomes injection), a targeted Optisome encapsulated formulation product candidate for the treatment of solid tumors, such as non-small-cell lung cancer. Optisomal encapsulation is a method of liposomal drug delivery, which is designed to increase tumor targeting and duration of exposure for cell-cycle specific anticancer agents.

More Details »         Alocrest™ (vinorelbine liposomes injection, OPTISOME™) A Novel Targeted Anti-Cancer Compound for Breast and Lung Cancer. Alocrest™ has completed a Phase I dose-escalation trial demonstrating promising anti-cancer activity as well as acceptable and predictable toxicity. More Details »  Brakiva™ (topotecan liposomes injection, OPTISOME™) A Novel Targeted Anti-Cancer Compound for Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Ovarian Cancer. Preclinical data demonstrate the value of Brakiva™ over conventional topotecan. More Details »  Menadione Topical Lotion - A Topical Compound for Skin Rash Associated with EGFR Inhibitors. Treatment with EGFR inhibitors such as Tarceva®, Erbitux® and Vectibix® are associated with an acne-form rash involving the face, neck and upper torso in approximately 75% patients. 50% of patients who manifest skin toxicity experience significant discomfort. This results in drug discontinuation or dose reduction in at least 10% and up to 30% of all subjects. Drug delivery is targeted to the normal location of the EGFR-containing skin cells at the dermal/epidermal junction without interfering with EGFR inhibition systemically at the level of the tumor.

Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Acquires Talon Therapeutics, Inc. | Business Wire
























































Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Acquires Talon Therapeutics, Inc.





        Acquisition adds a novel FDA-approved hematology product to Spectrum’s 
        portfolio.
      

        Marqibo® (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) for 
        intravenous infusion is expected to be launched later this year 
        through Spectrum’s existing hematology sales force.
      

        Marqibo is being evaluated in two ongoing Phase 3 trials that could 
        expand its label in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and front-line acute 
        lymphoblastic leukemia.
      

        Through the acquisition, Spectrum also obtains a Phase 2 oncology 
        supportive care drug, Menadione Topical Lotion.
      






July 17, 2013 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SPPI), a biotechnology company 
      with fully-integrated commercial and drug development operations with a 
      primary focus in hematology and oncology, today announced that, through 
      a wholly-owned subsidiary, the company entered into an agreement to 
      acquire Talon Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: TLON), a biopharmaceutical 
      company based in South San Francisco, California, and expects to 
      complete the acquisition within one day.
    


      In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Spectrum will pay 
      Talon stockholders an aggregate upfront cash consideration of 
      approximately $11.3 million and will issue 3 million shares of its 
      common stock in exchange for the cancellation of all of the outstanding 
      indebtedness under Talon’s credit facility. Talon stockholders will also 
      receive contingent value rights (CVRs) in an aggregate of up to $195 
      million in future cash payments from Spectrum upon the achievement of 
      certain one-time sales-based milestones for Marqibo® and an 
      approval-based milestone for Menadione Topical Lotion. There can be no 
      assurance as to the actual value, if any, of a CVR. The CVRs will not be 
      publicly traded.
    

      Through this acquisition, Spectrum will gain worldwide rights to 
      Marqibo, an FDA-approved hematology product for the treatment of 
      leukemia, as well as a Phase 2 product, Menadione Topical Lotion for the 
      treatment of the skin toxicity associated with epidermal growth factor 
      receptor anti-cancer agents, such as ERBITUX®. Marqibo, is a 
      novel, sphingomyelin-based liposome encapsulated formulation of 
      vincristine indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
      Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
      (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed 
      following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. Vincristine, a 
      microtubule inhibitor, is widely used in combination regimens for 
      treatment of adult and pediatric hematologic and solid tumor 
      malignancies. Spectrum expects to launch Marqibo with the same sales 
      force that sells its current oncology drugs, FOLOTYN® (pralatrexate 
      injection) and ZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan) injection for intravenous 
      use.
    

      “With this acquisition, we have added another drug that fits very well 
      with our hematology and oncology franchise and addresses an unmet 
      medical need for cancer patients,” said Rajesh C. Shrotriya, MD, 
      Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Spectrum 
      Pharmaceuticals. “In a registration trial in Ph- ALL patients who had 
      all previously failed multiple prior therapies and, therefore, had 
      limited treatment options, Marqibo, as a single agent, demonstrated 
      efficacy that led to accelerated approval by the FDA. By acquiring the 
      rights to Marqibo, Spectrum will be able to further leverage its current 
      infrastructure and experience in hematology and oncology to help these 
      patients. We are very excited about this potential transaction as it 
      delivers both an important clinical treatment to cancer patients and 
      compelling value to our shareholders.”
    

      Pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements, a wholly-owned 
      subsidiary of Spectrum entered into an agreement to purchase 
      approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of Talon directly from 
      Talon’s principal stockholders and purchased additional shares directly 
      from Talon that, together with the shares acquired from Talon’s 
      principal stockholders, represent in excess of 90% of the outstanding 
      shares of Talon. Spectrum, through its subsidiary, agreed to acquire the 
      remaining outstanding shares of common stock of Talon through a “short 
      form” merger under applicable Delaware law. Spectrum expects to complete 
      the merger and acquire 100% of the common stock within one day and, as a 
      result, Talon will become a subsidiary of Spectrum.
    

      Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., acting as the paying agent for the 
      merger, will mail to the remaining former stockholders of Talon 
      materials necessary to exchange their Talon shares for such payment. 
      Additionally, the paying agent will distribute an appraisal rights 
      notice containing additional detail regarding the transaction and the 
      consideration received by common stockholders within 10 days following 
      the merger.
    

      H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC is acting as Spectrum's exclusive advisor, 
      Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth, P.C. is acting as legal counsel to 
      Spectrum.

About FOLOTYN®


      FOLOTYN, (pralatrexate injection), a folate analogue metabolic 
      inhibitor, was discovered by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, SRI 
      International and Southern Research Institute and developed by Allos 
      Therapeutics. In September 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) granted accelerated approval for FOLOTYN for use as a single agent 
      for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. This 
      indication is based on overall response rate. Clinical benefit such as 
      improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival has not 
      been demonstrated. FOLOTYN has been available to patients in the U.S. 
      since October 2009. An updated analysis of data from PROPEL, the pivotal 
      study of FOLOTYN in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL, was 
      published in the March 20, 2011 issue of the Journal of Clinical 
      Oncology. FOLOTYN has patent protection through July 2022, based on a 
      five-year patent term extension through the Hatch-Waxman Act.
    

Important FOLOTYN® Safety Information


Warnings and Precautions


      FOLOTYN may suppress bone marrow function, manifested by 
      thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Monitor blood counts and omit 
      or modify dose for hematologic toxicities.
    

      Mucositis may occur. If greater-than or equal to Grade 2 mucositis is 
      observed, omit or modify dose. Patients should be instructed to take 
      folic acid and receive vitamin B12 to potentially reduce 
      treatment-related hematological toxicity and mucositis.
    

      Fatal dermatologic reactions may occur. Dermatologic reactions may be 
      progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Patients 
      with dermatologic reactions should be monitored closely, and if severe, 
      FOLOTYN should be withheld or discontinued. Tumor lysis syndrome may 
      occur. Monitor patients and treat if needed.
    

      FOLOTYN can cause fetal harm. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while 
      being treated with FOLOTYN and pregnant women should be informed of the 
      potential harm to the fetus.
    

      Use caution and monitor patients when administering FOLOTYN to patients 
      with moderate to severe renal function impairment.
    

      Elevated liver function test abnormalities may occur and require 
      monitoring. If liver function test abnormalities are greater-than or 
      equal to Grade 3, omit or modify dose.
    

Adverse Reactions


      The most common adverse reactions were mucositis (70%), thrombocytopenia 
      (41%), nausea (40%), and fatigue (36%). The most common serious adverse 
      events are pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, 
      dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia.
    

Use in Specific Patient Population


      Nursing mothers should be advised to discontinue nursing or the drug, 
      taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother.
    

Drug Interactions


      Co-administration of drugs subject to renal clearance (e.g., probenecid, 
      NSAIDs, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) may result in delayed renal 
      clearance.
    

      Please see FOLOTYN Full Prescribing Information at www.FOLOTYN.com.
    

About ZEVALIN® and the 
      ZEVALIN Therapeutic Regimen


      ZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) injection for intravenous use, is 
      indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, 
      low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). ZEVALIN is 
      also indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated 
      follicular non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma who achieve a partial or complete 
      response to first-line chemotherapy.
    

      ZEVALIN is a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody. The ZEVALIN 
      therapeutic regimen consists of two components: rituximab, and 
      Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radiolabeled ZEVALIN for therapy. ZEVALIN builds on 
      the combined effect of a targeted biologic monoclonal antibody augmented 
      with the therapeutic effects of a beta-emitting radioisotope.
    

Important ZEVALIN® Safety Information


      Deaths have occurred within 24 hours of rituximab infusion, an essential 
      component of the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen. These fatalities were 
      associated with hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or 
      cardiogenic shock. Most (80%) fatalities occurred with the first 
      rituximab infusion. ZEVALIN administration can result in severe and 
      prolonged cytopenias in most patients. Severe cutaneous and 
      mucocutaneous reactions, some fatal, can occur with the ZEVALIN 
      therapeutic regimen.
    

      Please see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS, for 
      ZEVALIN and rituximab. Full prescribing information for ZEVALIN can be 
      found at www.ZEVALIN.com.
    

About Marqibo®


      Marqibo is a novel, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated, 
      formulation of vincristine sulfate. Vincristine, a microtubule 
      inhibitor, is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with 
      Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
      (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed 
      following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. The encapsulation 
      technology, utilized in this formulation, has been shown to provide 
      prolonged circulation of vincristine in the blood.
    

Please see important safety information below and the full 
      prescribing information for Marqibo at www.marqibo.com.


Indication and usage


      Marqibo is a liposomal vinca alkaloid indicated for the treatment of 
      adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose 
      disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. 
      This indication is based on overall response rate. Clinical benefit such 
      as improvement in overall survival has not been verified.
    

Important safety information


CONTRAINDICATIONS



        Marqibo is contraindicated in patients with demyelinating conditions 
        including Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome
      

        Marqibo is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to 
        vincristine sulfate or any of the other components of Marqibo 
        (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection
      

        Marqibo is contraindicated for intrathecal administration
      


WARNING


See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.



For Intravenous Use Only — Fatal if Given by Other Routes


Death has occurred with intrathecal use


Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) has different 
        dosage recommendations than vinCRIStine sulfate injection. Verify drug 
        name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid 
        overdosage.



Warnings and Precautions


For Intravenous Use Only


      For Intravenous use only. Fatal if given by other routes.
    

Extravasation Tissue Injury


      Only administer through a secure and free-flowing venous access line. If 
      extravasation is suspected, discontinue infusion immediately and 
      consider local treatment measures.
    

Neurologic Toxicity


      Sensory and motor neuropathies are common and are cumulative. Monitor 
      patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, 
      hyperesthesia, paresthesia, hyporeflexia, areflexia, neuralgia, jaw 
      pain, decreased vibratory sense, cranial neuropathy, ileus, burning 
      sensation, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle spasm, or weakness, both before 
      and during treatment. Orthostatic hypotension may occur. The risk of 
      neurologic toxicity is greater if Marqibo is administered to patients 
      with preexisting neuromuscular disorders or when other drugs with risk 
      of neurologic toxicity are being given. In the studies of relapsed 
      and/or refractory adult ALL patients, Grade ≥ 3 neuropathy events 
      occurred in 32.5% of patients. Worsening neuropathy requires dose delay, 
      reduction, or discontinuation of Marqibo.
    

Myelosuppression


      Monitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Marqibo. If Grade 3 
      or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia develops, consider Marqibo 
      dose modification or reduction as well as supportive care measures.
    

Tumor Lysis Syndrome


      Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients with ALL receiving 
      Marqibo. Anticipate, monitor for, and manage.
    

Constipation and Bowel Obstruction


      Ileus, bowel obstruction, and colonic pseudo-obstruction have occurred. 
      Marqibo can cause constipation. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen 
      to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction, and/or paralytic 
      ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine 
      use of stool softeners, such as docusate. Additional treatments, such as 
      senna, bisacodyl, milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate, and lactulose may 
      be considered.
    

Fatigue


      Marqibo can cause severe fatigue. Marqibo dose delay, reduction, or 
      discontinuation may be necessary.
    

Hepatic Toxicity


      Fatal liver toxicity and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase 
      have occurred. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase of Grade ≥3 
      occurred in 6-11% of patients in clinical trials. Monitor hepatic 
      function tests. Reduce or interrupt Marqibo for hepatic toxicity.
    

Embryofetal Toxicity


      Marqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. 
      Vincristine sulfate liposome injection was teratogenic or caused 
      embryo-fetal death in animals. Women of childbearing potential should 
      avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Marqibo. There are no 
      adequate and well-controlled studies of Marqibo in pregnant women and 
      there were no reports of pregnancy in any of the clinical studies in the 
      Marqibo clinical development program. If this drug is used during 
      pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, 
      the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see

Adverse Reactions


      The most common adverse reactions ( > 30%) were constipation (57%), 
      nausea (52%), pyrexia (43%), fatigue (41%), peripheral neuropathy (39%), 
      febrile neutropenia (38%), diarrhea (37%), anemia (34%), decreased 
      appetite (33%), and insomnia (32%).
    

      The most commonly reported SAEs included febrile neutropenia (20.5%), 
      pyrexia (13.3%), hypotension (7.2%), respiratory distress (6.0%), and 
      cardiac arrest (6.0%).
    

      Twenty-eight percent of patients experienced adverse reactions leading 
      to treatment discontinuation. The most common adverse reactions that 
      caused treatment discontinuation were peripheral neuropathy (10%), 
      leukemia-related (7%), and tumor lysis syndrome (2%).
    

      Deaths occurred in 23% of patients in study 1. The non-leukemia related 
      causes of deaths were brain infarct (1), intracerebral hemorrhage (2), 
      liver failure (1), multi-system organ failure (2), pneumonia and septic 
      shock (3), respiratory failure (4), pulmonary hemorrhage (1), and sudden 
      cardiac death (1).
    

Drug Interactions


      No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with Marqibo. 
      Marqibo is expected to interact with drugs known to interact with 
      non-liposomal vincristine sulfate.
    

      Simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and 
      antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included non-liposomal 
      vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of 
      phenytoin and to increase seizure activity.
    

CYP3A Interactions


      Vincristine sulfate, the active agent in Marqibo, is a substrate for 
      cytochrome P450 3A isozymes (CYP3A); therefore, the concomitant use of 
      strong CYP3A inhibitors should be avoided (e.g., ketoconazole, 
      itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, 
      indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
      telithromycin). Similarly, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers 
      should be avoided (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, 
      rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort).
    

P-glycoprotein Interactions


      Vincristine sulfate, the active agent in Marqibo, is also a substrate 
      for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The effect of concomitant use of potent P-gp 
      inhibitors or inducers has not been investigated; it is likely that 
      these agents will alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of 
      Marqibo. Therefore the concomitant use of potent P-gp inhibitors or 
      inducers should be avoided.
    

Use in Specific Populations


Pregnancy


      Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions]
    

      Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, 
      Marqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women.
    

      If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes 
      pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
      potential hazard to a fetus. In an embryofetal developmental study, 
      pregnant rats were administered vincristine sulfate liposome injection 
      intravenously during the period of organogenesis at vincristine sulfate 
      doses of 0.022 to 0.09 mg/kg/day. Drug-related adverse effects included 
      fetal malformations (skeletal and visceral), decreases in fetal weights, 
      increased numbers of early resorptions and post-implantation losses, and 
      decreased maternal body weights Malformations were observed at doses ≥ 
      0.044 mg/kg/day in animals at systemic exposures approximately 20-40% of 
      those reported in patients at the recommended dose.
    

Nursing Mothers


      It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because 
      many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for 
      serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, a decision should be made 
      whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug taking into 
      account the importance of the drug to the mother.
    

Pediatric Use


      The safety and effectiveness of Marqibo in pediatric patients have not 
      been established.
    

Geriatric Use


      Safety and effectiveness in elderly individuals have not been 
      established. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be 
      cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, 
      or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
    

Renal Impairment


      The influence of renal impairment on the safety, efficacy, and 
      pharmacokinetics of Marqibo has not been evaluated.
    

Hepatic Impairment


      Non-liposomal vincristine sulfate is excreted primarily by the liver. 
      The influence of severe hepatic impairment on the safety and efficacy of 
      Marqibo has not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetics of Marqibo was 
      evaluated in patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh B) 
      secondary to melanoma liver metastases. The dose-adjusted maximum plasma 
      concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time 
      curve (AUC) of Marqibo in patients with moderate hepatic impairment was 
      comparable to the Cmax and AUC of patients with ALL who had 
      otherwise normal hepatic function.

Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Acquires Talon Therapeutics, Inc.Acquisition adds a novel FDA-approved hematology product to Spectrum's portfolio.Marqibo® (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) for intravenous infusion is expected to be launched later this year through Spectrum's existing hematology sales force.Marqibo is being evaluated in two ongoing Phase 3 trials that could expand its label in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and front-line acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Through the acquisition, Spectrum also obtains a Phase 2 oncology supportive care drug, Menadione Topical Lotion.HENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SPPI), a biotechnology company with fully-integrated commercial and drug development operations with a primary focus in hematology and oncology, today announced that, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the company entered into an agreement to acquire Talon Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQB: TLON), a biopharmaceutical company based in South San Francisco, California, and expects to complete the acquisition within one day.In connection with the closing of the acquisition, Spectrum will pay Talon stockholders an aggregate upfront cash consideration of approximately $11.3 million and will issue 3 million shares of its common stock in exchange for the cancellation of all of the outstanding indebtedness under Talon's credit facility. Talon stockholders will also receive contingent value rights (CVRs) in an aggregate of up to $195 million in future cash payments from Spectrum upon the achievement of certain one-time sales-based milestones for Marqibo® and an approval-based milestone for Menadione Topical Lotion. There can be no assurance as to the actual value, if any, of a CVR. The CVRs will not be publicly traded.Through this acquisition, Spectrum will gain worldwide rights to Marqibo, an FDA-approved hematology product for the treatment of leukemia, as well as a Phase 2 product, Menadione Topical Lotion for the treatment of the skin toxicity associated with epidermal growth factor receptor anti-cancer agents, such as ERBITUX®. Marqibo, is a novel, sphingomyelin-based liposome encapsulated formulation of vincristine indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. Vincristine, a microtubule inhibitor, is widely used in combination regimens for treatment of adult and pediatric hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. Spectrum expects to launch Marqibo with the same sales force that sells its current oncology drugs, FOLOTYN® (pralatrexate injection) and ZEVALIN® (ibritumomab tiuxetan) injection for intravenous use."With this acquisition, we have added another drug that fits very well with our hematology and oncology franchise and addresses an unmet medical need for cancer patients," said Rajesh C. Shrotriya, MD, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. "In a registration trial in Ph- ALL patients who had all previously failed multiple prior therapies and, therefore, had limited treatment options, Marqibo, as a single agent, demonstrated efficacy that led to accelerated approval by the FDA. By acquiring the rights to Marqibo, Spectrum will be able to further leverage its current infrastructure and experience in hematology and oncology to help these patients. We are very excited about this potential transaction as it delivers both an important clinical treatment to cancer patients and compelling value to our shareholders."Pursuant to the terms of the transaction agreements, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spectrum entered into an agreement to purchase approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of Talon directly from Talon's principal stockholders and purchased additional shares directly from Talon that, together with the shares acquired from Talon's principal stockholders, represent in excess of 90% of the outstanding shares of Talon. Spectrum, through its subsidiary, agreed to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of common stock of Talon through a "short form" merger under applicable Delaware law. Spectrum expects to complete the merger and acquire 100% of the common stock within one day and, as a result, Talon will become a subsidiary of Spectrum.Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc., acting as the paying agent for the merger, will mail to the remaining former stockholders of Talon materials necessary to exchange their Talon shares for such payment. Additionally, the paying agent will distribute an appraisal rights notice containing additional detail regarding the transaction and the consideration received by common stockholders within 10 days following the merger.H.C.

In September 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval for FOLOTYN for use as a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. This indication is based on overall response rate. Clinical benefit such as improvement in progression-free survival or overall survival has not been demonstrated. FOLOTYN has been available to patients in the U.S. since October 2009. An updated analysis of data from PROPEL, the pivotal study of FOLOTYN in patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL, was published in the March 20, 2011 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology. FOLOTYN has patent protection through July 2022, based on a five-year patent term extension through the Hatch-Waxman Act.Important FOLOTYN®Safety InformationWarnings and PrecautionsFOLOTYN may suppress bone marrow function, manifested by thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Monitor blood counts and omit or modify dose for hematologic toxicities.Mucositis may occur. If greater-than or equal to Grade 2 mucositis is observed, omit or modify dose. Patients should be instructed to take folic acid and receive vitamin B12 to potentially reduce treatment-related hematological toxicity and mucositis.Fatal dermatologic reactions may occur. Dermatologic reactions may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment. Patients with dermatologic reactions should be monitored closely, and if severe, FOLOTYN should be withheld or discontinued. Tumor lysis syndrome may occur. Monitor patients and treat if needed.FOLOTYN can cause fetal harm. Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with FOLOTYN and pregnant women should be informed of the potential harm to the fetus.Use caution and monitor patients when administering FOLOTYN to patients with moderate to severe renal function impairment.Elevated liver function test abnormalities may occur and require monitoring. If liver function test abnormalities are greater-than or equal to Grade 3, omit or modify dose.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions were mucositis (70%), thrombocytopenia (41%), nausea (40%), and fatigue (36%). The most common serious adverse events are pyrexia, mucositis, sepsis, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia.Use in Specific Patient PopulationNursing mothers should be advised to discontinue nursing or the drug, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother.Drug InteractionsCo-administration of drugs subject to renal clearance (e.g., probenecid, NSAIDs, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) may result in delayed renal clearance.Please see FOLOTYN Full Prescribing Information at www.FOLOTYN.com.About ZEVALIN®and the ZEVALIN Therapeutic RegimenZEVALIN (ibritumomab tiuxetan) injection for intravenous use, is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). ZEVALIN is also indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma who achieve a partial or complete response to first-line chemotherapy.ZEVALIN is a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody. The ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen consists of two components: rituximab, and Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radiolabeled ZEVALIN for therapy. ZEVALIN builds on the combined effect of a targeted biologic monoclonal antibody augmented with the therapeutic effects of a beta-emitting radioisotope.Important ZEVALIN®Safety InformationDeaths have occurred within 24 hours of rituximab infusion, an essential component of the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen. These fatalities were associated with hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiogenic shock. Most (80%) fatalities occurred with the first rituximab infusion. ZEVALIN administration can result in severe and prolonged cytopenias in most patients. Severe cutaneous and mucocutaneous reactions, some fatal, can occur with the ZEVALIN therapeutic regimen.Please see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNINGS, for ZEVALIN and rituximab. Full prescribing information for ZEVALIN can be found at www.ZEVALIN.com.About Marqibo®Marqibo is a novel, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated, formulation of vincristine sulfate. Vincristine, a microtubule inhibitor, is FDA-approved for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. The encapsulation technology, utilized in this formulation, has been shown to provide prolonged circulation of vincristine in the blood.Please see important safety information below and the full prescribing information for Marqibo atwww.marqibo.com.Indication and usageMarqibo is a liposomal vinca alkaloid indicated for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. This indication is based on overall response rate. Clinical benefit such as improvement in overall survival has not been verified.Important safety informationCONTRAINDICATIONSMarqibo is contraindicated in patients with demyelinating conditions including Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndromeMarqibo is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to vincristine sulfate or any of the other components of Marqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injectionMarqibo is contraindicated for intrathecal administrationWARNINGSee full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.For Intravenous Use Only — Fatal if Given by Other RoutesDeath has occurred with intrathecal useMarqibo (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) has different dosage recommendations than vinCRIStine sulfate injection. Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid overdosage.Warnings and PrecautionsFor Intravenous Use OnlyFor Intravenous use only. Fatal if given by other routes.Extravasation Tissue InjuryOnly administer through a secure and free-flowing venous access line. If extravasation is suspected, discontinue infusion immediately and consider local treatment measures.Neurologic ToxicitySensory and motor neuropathies are common and are cumulative. Monitor patients for symptoms of neuropathy, such as hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, hyporeflexia, areflexia, neuralgia, jaw pain, decreased vibratory sense, cranial neuropathy, ileus, burning sensation, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle spasm, or weakness, both before and during treatment. Orthostatic hypotension may occur. The risk of neurologic toxicity is greater if Marqibo is administered to patients with preexisting neuromuscular disorders or when other drugs with risk of neurologic toxicity are being given. In the studies of relapsed and/or refractory adult ALL patients, Grade ≥ 3 neuropathy events occurred in 32.5% of patients. Worsening neuropathy requires dose delay, reduction, or discontinuation of Marqibo.MyelosuppressionMonitor complete blood counts prior to each dose of Marqibo. If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia develops, consider Marqibo dose modification or reduction as well as supportive care measures.Tumor Lysis SyndromeTumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur in patients with ALL receiving Marqibo. Anticipate, monitor for, and manage.Constipation and Bowel ObstructionIleus, bowel obstruction, and colonic pseudo-obstruction have occurred. Marqibo can cause constipation. Institute a prophylactic bowel regimen to mitigate potential constipation, bowel obstruction, and/or paralytic ileus, considering adequate dietary fiber intake, hydration, and routine use of stool softeners, such as docusate. Additional treatments, such as senna, bisacodyl, milk of magnesia, magnesium citrate, and lactulose may be considered.FatigueMarqibo can cause severe fatigue. Marqibo dose delay, reduction, or discontinuation may be necessary.Hepatic ToxicityFatal liver toxicity and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase have occurred. Elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase of Grade ≥3 occurred in 6-11% of patients in clinical trials. Monitor hepatic function tests. Reduce or interrupt Marqibo for hepatic toxicity.Embryofetal ToxicityMarqibo can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Vincristine sulfate liposome injection was teratogenic or caused embryo-fetal death in animals. Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with Marqibo. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Marqibo in pregnant women and there were no reports of pregnancy in any of the clinical studies in the Marqibo clinical development program. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [see Use in Specific Populations].Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions ( > 30%) were constipation (57%), nausea (52%), pyrexia (43%), fatigue (41%), peripheral neuropathy (39%), febrile neutropenia (38%), diarrhea (37%), anemia (34%), decreased appetite (33%), and insomnia (32%).The most commonly reported SAEs included febrile neutropenia (20.5%), pyrexia (13.3%), hypotension (7.2%), respiratory distress (6.0%), and cardiac arrest (6.0%).Twenty-eight percent of patients experienced adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation.
