Vince's stock extends rally, rockets 54% premarket after receiving rights offering commitment
Vince's stock extends rally, rockets 54% premarket after receiving rights offering commitment

Vince's stock soars after receiving rights offering commitment letter
Shares of Vince Holding Corp.  shot up 36% in premarket trade Friday, to 45 cents, after the luxury apparel maker said it received a $30 million rights offering commitment letter from Sun Capital Partners V L.P. The letter indicates that Sun Capital will provide Vince with cash proceeds of $30 million in the event that Vince conducts a rights offering of its common stock. Vince shares have plunged amid concerns over a potential bankruptcy filing, after the company said earlier this month that it has "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The stock, which has traded below $1 since April 28, had lost 92% of its value through Thursday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has shed 7.0% and the S&P 500  has gained 5.7%.

Vince's stock loses two-thirds of its value amid 'substantial doubt' about its prospects
Shares of Vince Holding Corp.  plummeted 66% toward a record low in active afternoon trade Tuesday, less than a week after the clothing and accessories brand said it had "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The stock was briefly halted earlier for volatility. Volume in the stock, which was headed for its biggest-ever one-day percentage selloff, jumped to 9.2 million shares, which was nearly nine times the full-day average. The company was not immediately available for comment. The company disclosed late Friday in its annual report, which had been delayed by two weeks, said there is substantial doubt among its lenders regarding additional financing options and actions needed to improve the capital structure and contain costs. The stock closed Monday below $1 (95 cents) for the first time since it went public on Nov. 22, 2013, and was recently changing hands at 33 cents.

Here Is The Latest Retailer Possibly Headed Toward Liquidation
Shares of Sears Canada (SRSC) crashed Wednesday following reports that the ailing retailer could be headed for liquidation after moving to seek protection from creditors, deepening the wounds suffered by brick-and-mortar chains as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to pluck customers from malls. Sears Canada could have trouble selling off its locations to a single purchaser, as many of those locations are in lower-tier shopping centers, Bloomberg said.

Vince's stock extends rally, rockets 54% premarket after receiving rights offering commitment

Vince's stock soars after receiving rights offering commitment letter
Shares of Vince Holding Corp.  shot up 36% in premarket trade Friday, to 45 cents, after the luxury apparel maker said it received a $30 million rights offering commitment letter from Sun Capital Partners V L.P. The letter indicates that Sun Capital will provide Vince with cash proceeds of $30 million in the event that Vince conducts a rights offering of its common stock. Vince shares have plunged amid concerns over a potential bankruptcy filing, after the company said earlier this month that it has "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The stock, which has traded below $1 since April 28, had lost 92% of its value through Thursday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has shed 7.0% and the S&P 500  has gained 5.7%.

Vince's stock loses two-thirds of its value amid 'substantial doubt' about its prospects
Shares of Vince Holding Corp.  plummeted 66% toward a record low in active afternoon trade Tuesday, less than a week after the clothing and accessories brand said it had "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The stock was briefly halted earlier for volatility. Volume in the stock, which was headed for its biggest-ever one-day percentage selloff, jumped to 9.2 million shares, which was nearly nine times the full-day average. The company was not immediately available for comment. The company disclosed late Friday in its annual report, which had been delayed by two weeks, said there is substantial doubt among its lenders regarding additional financing options and actions needed to improve the capital structure and contain costs. The stock closed Monday below $1 (95 cents) for the first time since it went public on Nov. 22, 2013, and was recently changing hands at 33 cents.

Here Is The Latest Retailer Possibly Headed Toward Liquidation
Shares of Sears Canada (SRSC) crashed Wednesday following reports that the ailing retailer could be headed for liquidation after moving to seek protection from creditors, deepening the wounds suffered by brick-and-mortar chains as Amazon.com (AMZN) continues to pluck customers from malls.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Reports First Quarter 2017 ResultsBusiness WireJune 8, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Vince Holding Corp. (VNCE), a leading global luxury apparel and accessories brand (“Vince” or the “Company”), today reported unaudited results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 ended April 29, 2017.Brendan Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations. As anticipated, our wholesale business was negatively impacted primarily due to the elimination of our summer delivery. We saw sequential improvement in our direct-to-consumer business, led by ecommerce, and we are seeing this momentum continue into the second quarter. Looking ahead, we will remain focused on strengthening our direct-to-consumer business as well as take steps to optimize our wholesale business as we look to engage consumers across channels. In addition, we have recently strengthened our design and product development leadership and are excited about the product refinements and planned brand enhancements we have underway. Overall, we believe the Vince brand remains strong and we are making progress toward driving improved performance.”For the first quarter ended April 29, 2017: Net sales decreased 14.2% to $58.0 million from $67.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Wholesale segment sales decreased 20.9% to $35.4 million, primarily due to a reduction in full-price orders as a result of the elimination of the Company’s summer delivery. Direct-to-consumer segment sales decreased 1.0% to $22.6 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable sales decreased 5.7%, including e-commerce sales, due to a decrease in average order value.  Gross profit was $25.6 million, or 44.1% of net sales. This compares to gross profit of $28.3 million, or 41.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in the gross profit rate for the first quarter of 2017 reflected a favorable channel mix shift and decreased discounts from the liquidation of excess inventory in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, partially offset by higher allowances and supply chain costs.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $33.8 million, or 58.2% of sales compared to $31.8 million, or 47.0% of sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The growth in SG&A expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was due to increased costs associated with the remediation of the Company’s new systems, and higher product development, marketing, and new stores costs, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation, consulting, and temporary labor costs, in addition to transition, severance, and other strategic costs that did not reoccur in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.  Operating loss was $8.2 million, compared to operating loss of $3.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  Net loss was $9.3 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.9 million, or $0.05 per share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The net loss for the first quarter of 2017 does not include a benefit from income taxes due to the offsetting impact of the tax valuation allowance.  The Company ended the quarter with 54 company-operated stores, an increase of three stores since the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Balance SheetThe Company ended the first quarter of 2017 with $15.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $66.1 million of borrowings under its debt agreements. The increase in borrowings under its debt agreements over the prior year period is due to higher borrowings under the revolving credit facility.Gross inventory increased $2.7 million in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal 2016, while inventory reserves decreased $6.1 million as a result of less excess and aged inventory. As a result, net inventory at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $32.2 million compared to $23.4 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016.Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 totaled $1.8 million, primarily attributable to investments in new retail stores and the Company’s new systems.2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference CallA conference call to discuss the first quarter results will be held today, June 8, 2017, at 8:30 a.m. ET, hosted by Vince Holding Corp.

  Vince Holding Corp. (NYSE:VNCE), a leading global luxury apparel and accessories brand ("Vince" or the "Company"), today reported unaudited results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 ended April 29, 2017.  Brendan Hoffman, Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our first quarter results were largely in line with our expectations.

For the first quarter ended April 29, 2017:    Net sales decreased 14.2% to $58.0 million from $67.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Wholesale segment sales decreased 20.9% to $35.4 million, primarily due to a reduction in full-price orders as a result of the elimination of the Company's summer delivery. Direct-to-consumer segment sales decreased 1.0% to $22.6 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable sales decreased 5.7%, including e-commerce sales, due to a decrease in average order value.   Gross profit was $25.6 million, or 44.1% of net sales. This compares to gross profit of $28.3 million, or 41.8% of net sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

The growth in SG&A expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was due to increased costs associated with the remediation of the Company's new systems, and higher product development, marketing, and new stores costs, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation, consulting, and temporary labor costs, in addition to transition, severance, and other strategic costs that did not reoccur in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.

Balance Sheet   The Company ended the first quarter of 2017 with $15.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $66.1 million of borrowings under its debt agreements. The increase in borrowings under its debt agreements over the prior year period is due to higher borrowings under the revolving credit facility.
