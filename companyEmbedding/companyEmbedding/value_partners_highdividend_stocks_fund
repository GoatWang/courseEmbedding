Risk Disclosure 


Value Partners High-Dividend Stocks Fund (The “Fund”) primarily invests in higher yielding debt and equity securities in the Asian region.
The Fund may invest in higher-yielding debt and equity securities that are below investment grade. Such investments can involve greater risks due to the speculative nature.
The Fund may invest in China and other markets of the Asian region, therefore is subject to emerging market risks. Generally, investments in emerging markets are more volatile than investments in developed markets due to additional risks relating to political, social, economic and regulatory uncertainty. The value of the Fund can be extremely volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time. It is possible that the entire value of your investment could be lost.
The Fund may also invest in derivatives which can involve material risks, e.g. counterparty default risk, insolvency or liquidity risk, and may expose the Fund to significant losses.
In respect of the distribution units for the Fund, the Manager currently intends to make monthly dividend distribution. However, the distribution rate is not guaranteed. Distribution yield is not indicative of the return of the Fund. Distribution may be paid from capital of the Fund. Investors should note that where the payment of distributions are paid out of capital, this represents and amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of the amount you originally invested or capital gains attributable to that and may result in an immediate decrease in the value of units.
You should not make investment decision on the basis of this material alone. Please read the explanatory memorandum for details and risk factors.

*The Manager currently intends to make monthly dividend distribution in respect of the A2 MDis Classes; actual dividend payout will be subject to the Manager’s discretion. Distribution may be paid from capital of the fund. Investors should note that where the payment of distributions are paid out of capital, this represents and amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of the amount that have been originally invested or capital gains attributable to that and may result in an immediate decrease in the value of units. For A1 Class units, Manager will review dividend distribution at its discretion once a year (last dividend payout date: 21 Nov 2005).  Please refer to the explanatory memorandum for more details.
# Annualized yield is calculated as follows: (dividend amount / NAV as of ex-dividend date) x 12. Investors should note that yield figures are estimated and for reference only and do not represent the performance of the fund, and that there is no guarantee as to the actual frequency and/or amount of dividend payments. Please click here for Fund Dividend Composition Details.
^Performance fees will only be charged if the net asset value (NAV) at the end of the financial year exceeds the “high watermark”, which is the all-time year-end high of the fund’s NAV. If in any one year, the fund suffers a loss, no performance fee can be charged in subsequent years until the loss is recovered fully (the high-on-high principle).
SFC authorization is not a recommendation or endorsement of a scheme nor does it guarantee the commercial merits of a scheme or its performance. It does not mean the scheme is suitable for all investors nor is it an endorsement of its suitability for any particular investor or class of investors.
Please note that investment involves risks. The unit price of the Funds may go down as well as up and the past performance of the Funds does not indicate future return. Investors should refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Funds for further details and the risk factors in particular those involved in investing in emerging markets prior to the subscription of the units of the Fund.

*The Manager currently intends to make monthly dividend distribution in respect of the A2 MDis Classes; actual dividend payout will be subject to the Manager’s discretion. Distribution may be paid from capital of the fund. Investors should note that where the payment of distributions are paid out of capital, this represents and amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of the amount that have been originally invested or capital gains attributable to that and may result in an immediate decrease in the value of units. For A1 Class units, Manager will review dividend distribution at its discretion once a year (last dividend payout date: 21 Nov 2005).  Please refer to the explanatory memorandum for more details.
# Annualized yield is calculated as follows: (dividend amount / NAV as of ex-dividend date) x 12. Investors should note that yield figures are estimated and for reference only and do not represent the performance of the fund, and that there is no guarantee as to the actual frequency and/or amount of dividend payments. Please click here for Fund Dividend Composition Details.
^Performance fees will only be charged if the net asset value (NAV) at the end of the financial year exceeds the “high watermark”, which is the all-time year-end high of the fund’s NAV. If in any one year, the fund suffers a loss, no performance fee can be charged in subsequent years until the loss is recovered fully (the high-on-high principle).
SFC authorization is not a recommendation or endorsement of a scheme nor does it guarantee the commercial merits of a scheme or its performance. It does not mean the scheme is suitable for all investors nor is it an endorsement of its suitability for any particular investor or class of investors.
Please note that investment involves risks. The unit price of the Funds may go down as well as up and the past performance of the Funds does not indicate future return. Investors should refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Funds for further details and the risk factors in particular those involved in investing in emerging markets prior to the subscription of the units of the Fund.

 





Risk Disclosure 


Value Partners High-Dividend Stocks Fund (The “Fund”) primarily invests in higher yielding debt and equity securities in the Asian region.
The Fund may invest in higher-yielding debt and equity securities that are below investment grade. Such investments can involve greater risks due to the speculative nature.
The Fund may invest in China and other markets of the Asian region, therefore is subject to emerging market risks. Generally, investments in emerging markets are more volatile than investments in developed markets due to additional risks relating to political, social, economic and regulatory uncertainty. The value of the Fund can be extremely volatile and could go down substantially within a short period of time. It is possible that the entire value of your investment could be lost.
The Fund may also invest in derivatives which can involve material risks, e.g. counterparty default risk, insolvency or liquidity risk, and may expose the Fund to significant losses.
In respect of the distribution units for the Fund, the Manager currently intends to make monthly dividend distribution. However, the distribution rate is not guaranteed. Distribution yield is not indicative of the return of the Fund. Distribution may be paid from capital of the Fund. Investors should note that where the payment of distributions are paid out of capital, this represents and amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of the amount you originally invested or capital gains attributable to that and may result in an immediate decrease in the value of units.
You should not make investment decision on the basis of this material alone. Please read the explanatory memorandum for details and risk factors.

*The Manager currently intends to make monthly dividend distribution in respect of the A2 MDis Classes; actual dividend payout will be subject to the Manager’s discretion. Distribution may be paid from capital of the fund. Investors should note that where the payment of distributions are paid out of capital, this represents and amounts to a return or withdrawal of part of the amount that have been originally invested or capital gains attributable to that and may result in an immediate decrease in the value of units. For A1 Class units, Manager will review dividend distribution at its discretion once a year (last dividend payout date: 21 Nov 2005).  Please refer to the explanatory memorandum for more details.
# Annualized yield is calculated as follows: (dividend amount / NAV as of ex-dividend date) x 12. Investors should note that yield figures are estimated and for reference only and do not represent the performance of the fund, and that there is no guarantee as to the actual frequency and/or amount of dividend payments. Please click here for Fund Dividend Composition Details.
^Performance fees will only be charged if the net asset value (NAV) at the end of the financial year exceeds the “high watermark”, which is the all-time year-end high of the fund’s NAV. If in any one year, the fund suffers a loss, no performance fee can be charged in subsequent years until the loss is recovered fully (the high-on-high principle).
SFC authorization is not a recommendation or endorsement of a scheme nor does it guarantee the commercial merits of a scheme or its performance. It does not mean the scheme is suitable for all investors nor is it an endorsement of its suitability for any particular investor or class of investors.
Please note that investment involves risks. The unit price of the Funds may go down as well as up and the past performance of the Funds does not indicate future return. Investors should refer to the explanatory memorandum of the Funds for further details and the risk factors in particular those involved in investing in emerging markets prior to the subscription of the units of the Fund.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
