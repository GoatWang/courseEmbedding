I am hardly the only person, lawyer or not, who believes that. Mr. Cogan is the definitive embodiment of every desirable characteristic an attorney could have, including creativity, intelligence, knowledge, integrity, work ethic, motivation, meticulousness, street smarts, sincerity, compassion, and fairness. Mr. Cogan's explosive enthusiasm for prevailing in court and winning at life in general is highly inspirational and contagious. His electric charisma (both the star and leadership kinds), dignified aggressiveness, and artistic spontaneity during trials are breathtaking. I should know better than anyone, as Mr. Cogan won all nine of my difficult-to-win cases for me. Amongst Mr. Cogan's hundreds of spectacular, screams-volumes-about-his-superhuman-talent achievements include (at one time) holding the record for the largest civil liability judgement against the Philadelphia Police Department and being the lead prosecutor of the homicide unit at the young age of 27 whilst a Philadelphia assistant district attorney. Watching this legendary, larger-than-life god in court is like watching a highly entertaining, brilliantly acted, intricately scripted, and expertly directed Broadway play, sans the frivolous song and dance. I often wondered who was actually running the show, the judge or Mr. Cogan, who invariably commands extreme respect from all involved. Mr. Cogan's youthful good looks, endless energy, and infinite passion belie his true age. I am using my real name to prove that this is a genuine, unsolicited review, not that anyone who knows Mr. Cogan would ever suspect otherwise.A M R Cohen, Esquire Law OfficesChris K. ratedM.R. Cohen is the best immigration law lawyer in Pennsylvania or New Jersey!   I say this because of my wonderful experience with him.  I dealt with a few other immigration firms before Mr. Cohen's and they're NOT all the same!I was drawn to Mr. Cohen because of his easy manner, down to earth but knowledgeable style AND HIS OVER 30 years experience.    After meeting him the first time,  I KNEW he KNEW what he was talking about!I had a difficult Permanent Residency and then later Citizenship case...  especially because I had been convicted [although I was innocent] of shop lifting.   I never thought I would be a citizen,  but Mr. Cohen's knowledge of immigration law AND the people at USCIS won the case for me!   I still can't believe it. Mr. Cohen was readily available for all my inquiries.  His calm demeanor and attention to detail were especially appreciated.   He doesn't just tell you what you want to hear, though.   He tells you his honest opinion and chances for approval.  I LIKE that!I have referred many clients to his offices.  Every single referral was satisfied-- even the one who was denied his Permanent Residency because it turned out his divorce wasn't valid!   If you need a GOOD immigration lawyer,  you can save yourself a lot of time, expense and aggravation by going FIRST to Mr. Cohen at one of his offices in PA or NJ!Coleman & Kempinskimike4chj ratedI was very apprehensive about ...I was very apprehensive about the entire process of filing for Bankruptcy, I veiwed it as a diificult process to navigate and also was concerned what others might think if it were found out that I filed, when I first met with Kimberly and Ray, I truely felt at ease right away, I noticed and appreciated that they were not some stuffed shirts type lawyers, I even felt as if I knew them longer than what I really did, Kimberly made the process so easy and non-intimidating, she and Ray both addressed all my concerns and issues on the very first visit and I did my part and before I knew it was alll done, I had a couple of creditors try to come after me even after my discharge of debts, I just simply forwarded the information to Kimberly and she jumped on it immediatley, she kept me in the loop via email and provided me with a copy of the corospondence she sent to the creditors and I never heard from them again, nor any other creditor for that matter, it's been years since I felt this level of freedom, it's like a tremedous weight is gone, the harrasing calls and letters has stopped and now I can sleep at night and rebuild my credit thanks to Coleman & Kempiski....thanks Mike V.   The Law Office of Harper J Dimmerman PCJason M. ratedMy wife and I began working with Harper over a year and a half ago, when we began experiencing build quality issues with our newly constructed home. From the very beginning Harper not only showed us that he was exceptionally knowledgeable in real estate law, but that he was also truly committed to helping us - and most importantly committed to winning our case. He is very easy to talk to and very good at explaining complex legal matters in a way anyone can understand. He is always responsive to any questions or concerns we had during the process and was always very well informed and knowledgeable. Over the course of this very long process Harper has always gone above and beyond to ensure we were well informed, and directing us to take the appropriate steps to ensure we had the strongest case possible. He is calculatedly aggressive, making smart decisions on what moves to make and who to push and how hard - never coming across as your stereotypical 'shark' of a lawyer. Harper is truly a great lawyer and we will continue to go to him for any legal needs we have for as long as he is practicing.Affordable Legal Center, LLCKhaleel D. ratedI recently hired Attorney Kaplan to help me gain some level of custody of my two sons. I was seeking a lawyer because my son's mother was not allowing me to see them, sent me paperwork stating that she was sole legal custody of our children, seemingly taking me out of the picture. Upon my initial conversation with Attorney Kaplan, I reached a level of comfort that I had not experienced in a substantial amount of time due to the foolishness that my son's mother was engaging in. In spite of my lack of knowledge concerning how these kinds of cases play out, Attorney Kaplan was not only beyond patient with me, he was also very knowledgeable, elaborate, and informative in explaining the ins and outs of my case. Needless to say, Attorney Kaplan was able to make it so that both of my sons will be spending the holiday with me. There are not enough words to truly articulate and/or express the level of gratitude that I have for Attorney Kaplan, and his entire staff for being so diligent, temperate, and long suffering, all in efforts to help enable my sons to be with their dad!The Law Office of Harper J Dimmerman PCCarlo F. ratedI have used Harper Dimmerman, Esq. for a business partnership agreement and our family has used Mr. Dimmerman's services for a complex real estate matter involving separation of title on an out-of-state vacation property, as well as in a challenge to a residential property valuation involving several city agencies. In all three instances, we have found Mr. Dimmerman to be a strong, determined and effective attorney who delivered the exact results we needed.  He is unique among attorneys in smaller practices we have seen, in that he provides individualized attention and service, and takes the time to understand each matter fully in order to recommend the best strategy for success.  He is extremely organized and very accessible by telephone and email. I was also impressed that he has chaired bar association committees and is a frequent speaker on new developments in the law. We were extremely pleased with our outcomes and would not hesitate to recommend him for any legal need. Michael J. Graves Jr. LawFred R. ratedMy wife was appointed Michael grace jr. On September 14th in court by the judge. Since September 14th she has called, emailed and texted attorney graves every single day to no avail it has been one month and she is in a worse situation that when she started she informed Mr Graves that there was an emergency situation and it needed immediate attention we would have been grateful for any help at all and have gotten none at all. Maybe he is having as bad a time in court as i am. My previous attorney who was also appointed to me didn't even bother to show on September 14th. This lack of counsel then and now is the reason she is still involved with Philadelphia family court. PA DHS is a joke and has been grossly negligent. It should be an easy win for any lawyer. There have been 27 opened and closed DHS reports prior to this case. C'mon Mr graves. Help her. She is a great mother to her son. Please.. We cannot afford a private attorney witch is why Mr graves was appointed. Smh..Anthony Petrone Attyaron.martinez.1293 ratedIf you are looking for attorne...If you are looking for attorney to act as a security blanket offering pie in the sky results...look elsewhere. Anthony is the thorough analytical type, a true student of law, who goes past the depth of other lawyers to argue you're best position. In my case Anthony was tasked with negotiating within a very specific and difficult aspect of SEC and fraud law. When I consulted with five other attorneys during the course, including the foremost attorney in this field, those who understood the issues believed that I would lose completely. Anthony, always the realist, relentlessly argued my position till the most favorable outcome was agreed to. Through his actions I have saved my business and retained enough assets to start again. Truly unexpected results. When discussing my civil issue with another highly respected attorney with whom I consulted, she described Mr. Petrone as a "brilliant legal mind".Anthony Petrone Attypatricknilson ratedAnthony Petrone is the best of...Anthony Petrone is the best of the best. Having dealt with hundreds of attorneys over the decades, few if any have been as prepared, qualified, ethical, hardworking, tactical, logical, knowledgable, sophisticated, intelligent, honest, moral, sincere, fair, passionate, motivated, meticulous, compassionate, patient, relentless, experienced, anticipatory, cutting edge, street smart, aggressive, or expert. If there is a legal way to win a case, Mr. Petrone will find it. He is the main partner of legendary "super lawyer" Dennis Cogan. Unlike many lawyers, Mr. Petrone is so good that he has never advertised. His stellar reputation screams louder than any television or radio commercial ever could. As with Fed Ex, why fool around with anyone else? I am using my real name to prove that this is an unsolicited, genuine review, not that anybody who knows Mr. Petrone would ever suspect otherwiseThe Law Office of Harper J Dimmerman PCStacey F. ratedHarper Dimmerman is an excellent attorney and I highly recommend hiring him to anyone that is in need of representation for any real estate legal matter.  My family had a problem with a deed in trust that was initiated many years ago.  Mr. Dimmerman reviewed the deed and clearly explained all of the possible options, in layman’s terms, to correct the problem.  Additionally, he quickly responded to our issue and made us feel like we were his most important clients.  Due to his thorough and knowledgeable representation, we were able to make a decision that best suited our needs.  If you have a real estate issue and you want an attorney that is experienced, unpretentious, and will provide you with the best representation, you should obtain the services of Harper Dimmerman.  My family was more than satisfied with our experience.Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of.
