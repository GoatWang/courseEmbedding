History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

History[edit]
The 1990s[edit]
Liberty Media began in 1991 as a spin-off of TCI, an American cable-television group. Peter Barton, hired by TCI's Malone, served as president until retiring in April 1997 to start an investment firm and spend time with his family.[3]
The company took over TCI assets considered to have little value, but Barton completed "a deal every ten days for six years" and made the company a big success. Liberty was merged back into TCI in the mid-1990s.[4]
On March 13, 1998, Liberty Media Group and TCI Group announced the merger of Encore and STARZ! into a single company – Encore Media Group, owned by Liberty. Encore was taking advantage of the growth of digital cable, while TCI, which had previously owned twenty percent of Encore, was more interested in traditional cable.[5]
After U.S. Department of Justice approval that required TCI to sell its 23.5% interest in Sprint Corporation PSC,[6] TCI merged with AT&T on March 9, 1999[7] for approximately $48 billion. Liberty Media merged with TCI Ventures Group LLC (TCIVA), TCI's telephone and Internet businesses, and the resulting company became part of AT&T, giving Liberty Media $5.5 billion for use to repurchase stock or buy other companies.
AT&T bought the other TCI businesses – @Home Corp., National Digital Television Center and Western Tele-Communications Inc. – for $2.5 billion in cash. TCI chairman Malone, who became head of the new company, said buyers would not want all of TCI, but they would be interested in Liberty Media.[8] Malone wanted to start a finance unit similar to GE Capital, which could start new cable or Internet services. TCI had already planned digital cable set-top boxes.[9]
On September 28, 1998, Liberty Media announced the formation of Liberty Interactive, a company which would take advantage of new technologies such as set-top boxes to develop interactive programming. The company would own 86% of TCI Music Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: TUNE/TUNEP). As of January 1, 1999, E! Entertainment President and chief executive officer Lee Masters would become the new company's CEO, and Bruce Ravenel would be Chief Technology Officer.[10]
On September 10, 1999, Liberty Media Group renamed TCI Music to Liberty Digital Inc. (NASDAQ symbol: LDIG), with the new company trading on NASDAQ's National Market tier, after Liberty Media traded most of its Internet content, interactive television assets, and rights to provide AT&T's cable systems with interactive services, plus cash and notes valued at $150 million, for TCI Music stock.[11] Masters, who became Liberty Digital's CEO, told The Wall Street Journal that the new company had a value of $1 billion, $650 million of that from the interactive unit of Liberty Media, which had also used the name Liberty Digital.[12] Liberty Digital lost $244 million with revenue of $66 million in 1999, thanks to investments in struggling Internet businesses homegrocer.com, drugstore.com, TiVo and iVillage. The company bought half of the Game Show Network because of its interactive features.[13]
On December 17, 1999, TCI Satellite Entertainment Inc. (TSAT), based in Englewood, Colorado, announced that Liberty Media was trading its interest in Sprint PCS for $300 million in TCI Satellite preferred stock. A new company, 90% owned by Liberty Media and 10% owned by TCI Satellite, would combine the satellite-related businesses and take advantage of the growing area of Internet content. Liberty Media president and CEO Robert R. Bennett said the deal would benefit stockholders of both companies.[14]
Another new company was Liberty Livewire, formed from Todd-AO and two other companies by Liberty Media, which provided audio and video post-production services. David Beddow of TCI became CEO.[15]
The 2000s[edit]
Liberty Media's Discovery Channel and QVC continued to do well, but the company's newer projects had problems, and the company's stock price dropped by half. If AT&T agreed to spin off Liberty Media, new deals such as a possible News Corp. purchase of DirecTV would be easier because AT&T would no longer require federal approval to complete such deals.[16]
Liberty Media was spun off from AT&T on August 10, 2001.[17] This was one of three possible actions to ensure federal approval of AT&T's $54 billion acquisition of MediaOne Group – the others were selling its 25.5% share of Time Warner Entertainment and dropping 11.8 million cable customers.[18]
Also in 2001, Liberty Media acquired the remainder of Liberty Digital and Liberty Satellite & Technology (formerly TCI Satellite). Both companies were independent spinoffs of TCI, though Liberty already owned 90% of both companies after the exchange for Sprint PCS stock. Being independent increased their asset values, but the stock prices of both dropped, negating any benefits.[19][20]
Liberty Media subsequently spent $5 billion on nine German regional cable networks. Apart from television distribution it holds major interests in other groups. For example, it was the largest shareholder in News Corporation (though the founding Murdoch family owns more voting shares), and had a 4% stake in Time Warner.
In June 2005, Liberty Media International combined with UnitedGlobalCom, creating Liberty Global.
In May 2006, Time Warner acquired Liberty Media's 50% stake in Court TV for $735 million.[21]
On May 16, 2006, IDT sold its IDT Entertainment division to Liberty Media "for all of Liberty Media's interests in IDT, $186 million in cash and the assumption of existing indebtedness". IDT Entertainment's assets and Starz Entertainment Group's line of premium television channels will combine to produce content for all distribution platforms.[22]
Liberty negotiated an asset swap with News Corp. and Time Warner that would give it control of DirecTV and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.[23] On February 12, 2007, the deal was completed with Time Warner wherein Liberty would receive the Atlanta Braves, a group of craft magazines and $1 billion in cash in exchange for 60 million shares of Time Warner stock (valued at $1.27 billion as of market close on February 12, 2007).[24] The deal was approved by Major League Baseball and then completed on May 16, 2007.[25] On February 20, 2008, the Federal Communications Commission approved the exchange of 16.3% of News Corp. for 38.4% of DirecTV, an $11 billion deal that also gave Liberty sports networks in Denver, Pittsburgh and Seattle plus $550 million in cash.[26]
In April 2007, Liberty completed a purchase of Green Bay, Wisconsin, television station WFRV-TV, and satellite station WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan, which serves the Marquette, Michigan, market. The deal was part of a swap of 7.59 million shares of common stock in CBS, the stations' owner, that was held by Liberty Media; in exchange for the stock, CBS gave liberty the stations and $170 million in cash.[27] Liberty announced plans in April 2011 to sell WFRV and WJMN to Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $20 million.[28]
On February 17, 2009, Liberty announced that it would invest up to $530 million into the struggling Sirius XM Radio Inc., in a structured deal that would help the satellite radio provider avoid filing bankruptcy protection by meeting its obligations. The deal also provided for two board seats for Liberty Media, and provided cash for operations and development, with a maturity date of December 2012 for the loan.[29] On March 6, the two companies approved the second part of the deal, with Sirius XM getting $250 million immediately and Liberty receiving 12.5 million shares of preferred stock convertible into a 40% ownership of Sirius XM common stock.[30]
The 2010s[edit]
On the Fortune 500 list 2011, Liberty Media was ranked 224, moving up from 2010 when they were ranked 227.[31]
In May 2011, Liberty announced it was in talks to buy the Barnes & Noble bookstore chain for $1.02 billion.[32] It eventually bought a 16% stake in the form of preferred stock in Barnes & Noble for $204 million.[33]
On August 8, 2012, Liberty Media announced that it would spin off Starz into a separate publicly traded company.[34] The spin-off of Starz Inc. was completed on January 15, 2013.[35]
The company agreed in March 2013 to pay $2.62 billion for 27.3% of Charter Communications from Apollo Management, Oaktree Capital Management and Crestview Partners with the provision that Liberty would not increase its stake past 35% until after January 2016 but no more than 39.99%.[36] By May 1, Liberty completed the transaction and placed four directors on Charter's board.[37]
In late 2016, Liberty Media agreed to buy the Formula One Group for US$4.4 billion (£3.3 billion).[38]

On September 3, 2008, Liberty Media decided to initiate the process of spinning off Liberty Entertainment to Liberty Media shareholders, leaving Malone with a majority ownership of the new company.[41] On May 4, 2009, The DirecTV Group Inc. said it would become a part of Liberty's entertainment unit, part of which would then be spun off as a separate company called DirecTV. The new company would also acquire Liberty's one hundred percent interests in the three FSN networks and its 50% interest in GSN. The rest of the unit would be traded as Liberty Starz. Liberty would increase its share of DirecTV from 48 to 54%, with Malone and his family owning 24%.[citation needed]
On May 4, 2009, Liberty announced that it would split off Liberty Entertainment, Inc., a subsidiary of Liberty owning the three Fox Sports Net (FSN) channels (now Root Sports) acquired under the swap with News Corp. and Liberty's 65% interest in GSN, into a separate company that would merge with The DirecTV Group, reducing Liberty owner John Malone's stake in DirecTV to 24%.[42] The merger was completed on November 19, 2009, with The DirecTV Group and Liberty Entertainment becoming subsidiaries of a new company named DirecTV.[43]
On June 16, 2010, Malone exchanged his preferred stock in DirecTV with equivalent amounts of common stock, reducing his voting interest in the company from 24% to 3%, with Malone resigning as chairman and ending his managerial role at DirecTV.[44]

GREGORY B. MAFFEI - MICROSOFT CORP.Category: INFORMATION / KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & RISK MANAGEMENT At Microsoft, leveraging internal technology and expertise is the key to creating value. Edward Teach, CFO MagazineOctober 1, 1999
Greg maffei seems a little uncomfortable with all the attention he's been getting lately, even though most of it is the kind that any CFO would be happy to have. He's proud of his accomplishments as senior vice president and CFO of Microsoft Corp., but he worries that his finance team won't get its due share of credit. And he was already the subject of a recent cover story for this magazine ("Smooth Operator," August), so it's understandable that he'd rather spend less time with reporters and more time on the affairs of his company.
Nevertheless, attention must be paid. That's because Maffei is the winner of two awards in this year's CFO Excellence competition, for information/knowledge management and risk management. And though he received plenty of help from his colleagues in Redmond, Washington, the value of his leadership is clear.
Some might think that Maffei's victory in information/knowledge management is a little too pat. Microsoft, after all, is arguably the world's leading vendor of information- management software, and it has a workforce of techies eager to use it. But in fact, the award was anything but a gimme putt. Like many other companies, Microsoft used to have financial systems that barely kept up with growth. Finance had trouble responding to new information needs -- it required two weeks to close the books. And like many a corporate Luddite, Microsoft used to rely solely on hard- copy reports, distributing more than 350,000 a year.
If the software giant was more advanced when it came to risk management (thanks in no small part to Maffei's work in his previous job, as treasurer), it still faced stiff competition from the other finalists. But in the end, Microsoft's innovations in managing both financial and general business risk -- including, of course, a sophisticated, Web- based risk-evaluation system -- put the 39- year-old Maffei on top.
Characteristically, Maffei sees these results as a benchmark of collective progress. "Finance was not viewed as a cutting- edge place in the company five years ago," he says. "We have tried to build a place that has intellectual challenge and competence."
Based on the evidence presented here, he's succeeded.
Information Management: A Digital Nervous SystemWhile it is hard to believe that Microsoft wasn't always on the cutting edge in information management, it's easy to see why it needed to get there. Consistent annual growth of 30 percent­plus sent net revenues soaring, from $800 million in 1988 to nearly $20 billion in fiscal 1999. And until a few years ago, that stellar growth exposed glaring inefficiencies in financial reporting. For example, there wasn't a master chart of accounts for the company's financial groups (now numbering 54) to work with. At one point, Microsoft had more than 30 separate general ledgers around the world, with inconsistent data definitions.
To bring order out of chaos, Microsoft, starting under former CFO Michael Brown, set out to build what it calls a "financial digital nervous system" (FDNS). Based on common policies and processes, the FDNS was intended to provide a coherent, worldwide replacement for the company's disconnected systems. It would deliver fast, global access to information and financial reports, and it would provide an infrastructure for knowledge management and collaboration.
In short, Microsoft wanted "a world-class information system," says Maffei, who stresses the team effort in its development--and, in particular, controller Scott Boggs, whom he calls "the driving force" behind the system.
The FDNS was built on three primary technologies: an enterprise transaction- processing system, SAP R/3; data warehousing, which extracts SAP's transactional data for analysis; and a financial intranet, which knits together the financial groups and allows employees to access both SAP and the warehouse from their desktops.
The core of the system, R/3, was selected in 1995. Its financial modules were implemented in seven months, along with a single chart of accounts. At the same time, Microsoft upgraded its network bandwidth to accommodate SAP data traffic. Today, the system serves 2,000 named users and, thanks to its integration with the intranet, 39,000 total users--that is, Microsoft's entire workforce--in 62 countries.
To consolidate the SAP information and make it available for analysis, Microsoft created a financial data warehouse and reporting system, dubbed MARS (Management Reporting System). Refreshed daily, the warehouse's database system is Microsoft SQL Server. It's augmented by OLAP Services, Microsoft's online analytical processing engine. Microsoft Excel provides a standard user interface with drill- down capability; a custom tool, called MS Reports, enables deeper, multidimensional analysis.
Finally, to share all this information, Microsoft created a financial intranet, FinWeb, in 1995. Detailed financial reports are now posted on FinWeb and updated daily. In addition, virtually every financial group has a site on the intranet. From their desktops, employees can visit FinWeb sites to submit expense reports, purchase goods and services, review P&L and headcount reports, and transfer capital assets.

Having Your Dog Food and Eating It, Too Today, the world-class information system produces world-class benefits. Microsoft now closes its books on a worldwide basis in three days; the ultimate goal is a continuous close. Financial reporting has become "hugely efficient," says Maffei. All management reporting in the company is now processed by just 30 employees, including IT staffers.
Managers can make faster, better-informed decisions, thanks to their ability to summon and parse relevant data in near-real time. Expense reporting, procurement, and invoicing are now 98 percent paperless, including reporting and approval capabilities.
Maffei readily concedes that the development of the nervous system was aided by the fact that Microsoft is Microsoft. "It was driven by an intimate knowledge of and familiarity with Microsoft tools; that's a great foundation," he says. "We have a willingness to 'eat our own dog food' -- to use the latest tools, the latest features. We have a group of people willing to accept the challenge of new technology."
Risk Management: An Enterprise Approach New technology also lies at the heart of Microsoft's risk-management efforts, but it's far from the whole story. In risk management as well as information management, Maffei and colleagues are spectacularly multitasking.
Microsoft is a pioneer of the enterprise approach to risk management, dating back to the creation of the Microsoft Risk Management Group in fiscal 1997. Under the direction of Brown, Maffei, assistant treasurer Jean- François Heitz (now treasurer), and then­risk manager Scott Lange, the group conducted a thorough risk assessment of the entire company. Today, the group watches no fewer than 144 separate risks, from market share and pricing wars to industrial espionage and workforce skill-sets.
One result of the assessment was an umbrella insurance policy, crafted in fiscal 1998 to cover a variety of risks. But perhaps more important was the promotion of a heightened awareness of risk throughout the company. Microsoft wants managers in every function to understand the risk embodied in every decision they make. And to help them do that, the company developed a Web-based knowledge tool in 1997 called RISKS (Risk Information System for Knowledge Sharing).
Residing on the intranet, RISKS has eight major components, including a menu of risks organized by type; contacts for internal experts on risk subjects; anecdotes of lessons learned from dealing with risks; and best practices for minimizing risk in the design of business processes. Before launching any new projects, managers are encouraged to consult the system.
Meanwhile, to manage financial risk, treasury has pioneered hedging techniques and improved on existing ones. For example, starting in 1994 under treasurer Maffei, Microsoft was one of the first companies to write put warrants on its own stock, in order to reduce the cost and risk associated with its stock-repurchase program.
"It was something I had to do at the time--the market was starting to heat up," recalls Maffei. The company periodically repurchases its stock to prevent dilution of earnings per share through the exercise of employee stock options. Selling put warrants on its stock partially defrays the cost of the buybacks. Moreover, the strike price of the puts is set at a level that the company would be willing to pay for its stock anyway. The warrants also have a "net share settle" option that allows Microsoft to issue new shares in lieu of cash.
So far, no puts have been exercised against Microsoft, but premiums from the warrants have reduced the cost of the buyback program by $2 billion, or more than 15 percent. Who buys the puts? Not investors betting on the direction of the stock. "We are selling volatility," says Maffei.
Embarrassment of RichesMaffei also pushed Microsoft to take a systematic approach to foreign-exchange hedging. Starting in 1997, the company began matching the time horizons of hedges with the horizons of exposures. Treasury staffers run Monte Carlo simulations to determine probability distributions of future exchange rates; the distributions are used to compare the effectiveness of different hedges with their costs.
The revamped hedging program consists of two parts. The net-revenue hedging program, which manages risk for 12-month periods on a rolling basis, has so far delivered more than $86 million in insurance payouts, net of hedging costs. And the cash flow hedging program, which manages risk for short-term foreign receivables, has added another $3 million in profits.
There's no speculation afoot, though. "The vast majority of programs are straight hedges," says Maffei. "I expect that they will continue to make money, but we don't run [hedging] as a profit center."
The cash flow from Microsoft's hedging is a trickle compared with the returns on its portfolio, which has ballooned to $26 billion in the form of fixed-income, equity, and foreign-exchange holdings. Such a monster would have seriously strained the company's old treasury systems, which were assembled on an ad hoc basis and poorly integrated. Treasury data wasn't centrally managed; senior managers had difficulty appraising the market risks being assumed.
All of these weaknesses have been eliminated with a new, integrated treasury system, called Gibraltar. Consisting of a transaction system, an investment data warehouse, and a risk analysis and reporting tool, Gibraltar enables treasury staffers to optimize performance of the portfolio.

Heady stuff, all this, but Maffei has the bandwidth -- and, of course, the finance team - - to handle it. "We're blessed," he says. "Microsoft is the kind of place where there's a culture of hiring smart people. It starts with Bill [Gates]. We push to hire smart people, and offer them financial incentives to do interesting work."
The rich get richer. Somehow, it doesn't seem fair.

			|

     said Bob Herbold, chief operating officer.
      “We are confident that as CFO he will help continue our financial excellence and tradition of conservatism.”

Prior to joining Microsoft, Brown was a partner at the public accounting firm of Deloitte  &  Touche, where he was involved in the Microsoft engagement since 1979. He is chairman of the board of directors of the NASDAQ Stock Market and a director of Wang Laboratories and Kurzweil Educational Systems. He is also a member of the Conference Board, Officers Conference Group, Financial Executives Institute, Financial Executives Research Foundation Trustees, Center for Strategic and International Studies, and University of Washington School of Business Administration Advisory Board. 
Since 1996, Maffei has been responsible for Microsoft’s corporate development, planning, accounting, reporting, and treasury departments. He has overseen the company’s cash and strategic investment portfolio and led the Comcast, WebTV and Vermeer transactions. Maffei joined Microsoft in 1993 as director of business development and investments. He earned an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he was a Baker Scholar, and an AB degree from Dartmouth College. Maffei serves as a director of Citrix Systems, Comcast (observer), CORT Business Services, and Mtel.
