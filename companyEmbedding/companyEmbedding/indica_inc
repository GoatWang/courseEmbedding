STAY ONE STEP AHEAD 
WITH HALO IMAGE ANALYSIS 
 
Optimizing algorithms, annotating digital slides, and compute-time can lengthen time-to-results. HALO™ addresses these shortfalls to help your lab achieve quality analysis in the shortest time possible.



 
SHORTEN THE LEARNING CURVE
Spend less time learning software and more time analyzing data. HALO’s analysis tuning is fast and easy for experts and novices alike, without sacrificing data quality. No need to ‘build’ analysis algorithms from scratch. HALO’s flexible, purpose-built modules provide quick, quantitative results in oncology, neuroscience, metabolism, toxicological pathology, and more.










 
RAPIDLY ANNOTATE SLIDES
Do you dread annotating digital slides using your current system? Cut annotation time in half with HALO’s intuitive, flexible annotation tools. Draw free-hand or use the magnet pen tool to automatically ‘snap’ annotations to your tissues. Easily redraw, amend, move, rotate or copy-paste existing annotations. Better still, teach the classifier module to automatically select tissues of interest for analysis across all images in a study.



 
TURBO-CHARGE ANALYSIS SPEED
Digital slides are large and bog down conventional analysis systems. HALO’s parallel processing technology and optimized algorithms yield up to 4 times the analysis rate of competitive solutions using the same standard hardware. Organizations with greater throughput demands can couple HALO with Hyper-Cluster™ combined hardware and software technology to reach speeds up to 25 times faster than competitor solutions.




 





 
EASILY EXPLORE CELLULAR DATA
HALO reports morphological and multiplexed expression data on a cell-by-cell basis across entire tissue sections and maintains an interactive link between cell data and cell image. Click on any cell in the image and immediately see analysis outputs for that specific cell. Sorting and filtering capabilities allow the user to mine millions of cells while visually assessing corresponding cell populations. For example, sort cells according to biomarker intensity and immediately locate cells with highest intensity in the image. Just imagine the endless possibilities.



 
GROW WITH HALO MODULES
A modular platform that can expand with your needs. Start with a few modules, and add more as your needs change. Use HALO on a single workstation or ramp up to a server based license for your entire group. HALO is flexible enough for a variety of budgets.

Biomarker Discovery Services
Complex data from multiplexed immuno-oncology studies or high-throughput tissue microarrays can be overwhelming. Our bioanalytics team use HALO™, STRATA™ and Deep Neural Networks to discover/optimize/validate tissue-based biomarkers for improved patient stratification.



Clinical Trial Support
Get more out of clinical trials. We offer clinical study support through a HIPAA compliant instance of HALO LINK™. This web-based histopathology platform enables multi-institutional pathologist collaboration, tissue analysis, data mining, and bioinformatic insight.

 
What Our Clients Are Saying:

“Our ability to generate quantitative data describing the tumor microenvironment has been facilitated by systems such as HALO.  Once that was accomplished, the next constraint became management and analysis of large data sets. We’ve utilized the STRATA service for a number of different projects to help with this issue. Specifically, we’ve engaged their biostatistical service to help identify prognostic and predictive features of the tumor microenvironment. The service has also helped us generate custom visual representations of the results for publication purposes.”  – Janis Taube MD, Director of Dermatopathology at Johns Hopkins University
