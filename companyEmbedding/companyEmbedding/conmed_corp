The acquisition, which closed July 3, 2017, includes both the ExoShape FEMORAL and TIBIAL Soft Tissue Fasteners, used to fixate soft tissue grafts in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery."The ExoShape System has represented a valuable portion of MedShape's business since 2011, and this acquisition further demonstrates the success of the development and commercialization efforts invested in the product," said Kurt Jacobus, MedShape's CEO. "While we will certainly miss serving our patients, doctors and distributors with this product line, we look forward to focusing our efforts towards growing our core foot and ankle business with new investments."The ExoShape ACL Fixation System represents a breakthrough in soft tissue fixation, as it was the first all-PEEK system to offer a non-rotational deployment and interference fixation approach for ACL reconstruction. Manufactured out of shape memory PEEK Altera®, the ExoShape fasteners are delivered in a low-profile shape for easy insertion and then fully expanded upon instantaneous deployment to effectively compress and secure the soft tissue graft inside the bone tunnel.About CONMED CorporationCONMED is a medical technology company that provides surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures.

CorasantiCEO & PresidentConMed Corporation525 French RoadUtica, New York 13502Ref: DEN-14-02-WLDear Mr. Corasanti: During an inspection of your firm, ConMed Electrosurgery, located at 14603 E. Fremont Avenue, Centennial, CO,on August 12 through September 20, 2013, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures medical devices used for open and laparoscopic surgical procedures, including the Altrus Tissue Fusion System, Hyfrecator 2000, and BiCap Hemostasis Probe.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(h)], these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. The inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(h)], in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.  We received responses from Mr. Dave Murray, Executive Vice President and General Manager, dated October 11 and November 19, 2013 concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm. We address these responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.    Procedures for design change have not been adequately established, per 21 CFR 820.30(i). Your Design Verification & Validation procedures, SOP #168 (Rev. 1 & 2) require an evaluation of the impact of changes to a released design on the device function and performance. However, your firm failed to fully and adequately evaluate design changes to Altrus Tissue Fusion System 5mm and 10mm Handpieces to ensure that verification and/or validation activities were complete. For example: a.    Your firm failed to adequately evaluate the potential effect of (b)(4). Specifically, a design change was made to the (b)(4). (b)(4); however, (b)(4) Tests were deemed unnecessary based on a previous engineering study. The engineering study was found to have numerous deficiencies including: i.        No documentation of how the (b)(4) were obtained.ii.        No documented rationale for measuring (b)(4) when, at the time, the handpiece was designed for up to 200 activations.iii.        (b)(4) modes, respectively. Your firm failed to re-evaluate the engineering study when, at a later date, you defined a (b)(4). Additionally, there was no documented justification for the (b)(4) specification.iv.        No studies were conducted on the 10mm handpieces even though the design of the (b)(4) differs from the 5mm handpiece (b)(4).v.        The study was conducted using (b)(4) only. No actual production parts were studied. b.    Your firm failed to adequately evaluate a revision to the Altrus Tissue Fusion System Controller Software which (b)(4). Specifically, after your Impact Analysis determined that the software change would (b)(4) tests, these protocols were repeated; however, numerous deficiencies were observed with the design verification protocols, including: i.        No documentation of any (b)(4) tests to evaluate (b)(4) on the 5mm handpieces.ii.        (b)(4) handpieces (5mm) tested for (b)(4) failed the (b)(4) acceptance criteria (b)(4) test points (combined total), yet the (b)(4) were not investigated and the Design Verification Report results were marked as “Pass”.iii.        The Design Verification Reports, 5mm Handpiece (b)(4) and (b)(4) report show that the design verification tests were conducted with (b)(4), not the (b)(4).iv.        The Design Verification Protocol, approved on 12/21/12 and executed on 12/24/12, shows that multiple tests were “Not executed per (b)(4); however, that document, (b)(4), was not approved until 2/26/13, approximately two months after the executed protocol. Furthermore, Impact Analysis (b)(4) does not include any justification for omitting certain tests (b)(4).v.        Design Verification report, (b)(4), shows that your firm used data from a previous design verification study (b)(4) which showed failing results for (b)(4) handpieces tested for (b)(4) and which stated, (b)(4).However, there was no documentation that the failing test results were addressed. c.    Design verification for a software change (b)(4) was incomplete. Design control deficiencies included:                                      i.    No documentation of any (b)(4) tests to evaluate (b)(4).ii.    The Impact Analysis record for the 10mm handpieces (b)(4) identified (b)(4) of the 10mm handpiece that were affected by the (b)(4); however, test data showed that the (b)(4) Test for (b)(4) only tested the (b)(4), not the specified (b)(4). The results were marked as “Passed.”iii.        (b)(4) handpieces (b)(4) tested for (b)(4) failed the (b)(4) verification acceptance criteria (b)(4) test points (combined total), yet the (b)(4) were not investigated and the Design Verification Report results were marked as “Pass” on the Design Verification Report.iv.    The Design Verification Report (b)(4) summarizes results from the executed Altrus Handpiece Design Verification Protocol (b)(4) which indicated that both 5mm and 10mm handpieces were to be evaluated for (b)(4); however, there was no documentation that 10mm handpieces were subjected to these tests.v.    Portions of the Installation Qualification for the (b)(4), applicable to the configuration file were (b)(4) in the 10mm handpiece (b)(4). However, the associated Performance Qualification was not re-executed (b)(4) We have reviewed your October 11, 2013 response and do not consider it to be adequate. Some specific examples include the following, but these should only be considered as examples and not an all-inclusive list of our concerns with your response to this observation.  The justification for the (b)(4) specification of (b)(4) was not available during the inspection, and was not sent with your initial response. When it was subsequently provided, it was dated 10/4/2013, well after the (b)(4) specification was set.  Furthermore, during the verification studies for the (b)(4), the (b)(4) studies were completed with unapproved verification test methodology, following which, your firm concluded that the design change had no impact on (b)(4). We must question the conclusion when an unapproved test method was used to obtain important data.  Your October 11 response indicated that verification studies had been conducted on the 10mm handpiece for the design change to the (b)(4) and referenced report (b)(4). This report was not provided to the investigators during the inspection and was not provided as part of your response.  Your response acknowledges that (b)(4) verification was conducted using the (b)(4) rather than (b)(4), for the (b)(4). We are not clear why your firm would intentionally choose to use an (b)(4) for a portion of verification activities rather than clearly verifying the entire change with the (b)(4). Our main concern is that your response included a number of reports, studies, etc., which you are using to justify the design changes, that were not conducted until well after the design changes were implemented and devices were released for distribution, and after your firm received the FDA-483. We have serious concerns regarding your design controls system due to the number and extent of issues observed regarding the Altrus Thermal Tissue Fusion system. We acknowledge that you have revised (b)(4) procedures in this area and have stated that a review of Design History Files for all products will be conducted, and further that you will have “independent corporate auditors” assess the Quality system at the Centennial facility. We will review revised procedures and your adherence to the new procedures during a future inspection as we also reevaluate your design controls and quality systems. However, with the number of verification reports, impact analyses, test protocols, etc. that were completed for the handpieces only after the inspection, we are concerned with the appearance of justifying changes after the fact. We recommend a thorough examination of your design controls system and documentation practices to assure that all required documentation is in place, that reports do not reference other reports which post-date the first report, that approved test methodologies are used, etc. Should your corrective action plan change or expand following the audit of the facility, please provide details of the changes with your response. As stated previously, the specific examples above should not be considered an all-inclusive list of our concerns regarding your response to this observation. Please also see the “510(k)” section for additional concerns. 2.    Procedures for corrective and preventive actions have not been adequately established, as required by 21 CFR 820.100.(a). Specifically, since release of the Altrus Tissue Fusion System, your firm has received 18 complaints regarding burns, potential burns, or handpieces that were “too hot”; (b)(4) of these complaints resulted in patient injury (either internal or external burns). A Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) was not initiated, in spite of 1) patient burn injuries, 2) complaint trending codes including “Overheating of component(s)” and “Overheat”, and 3) the total number of complaints regarding the temperature of the device. We have reviewed your October 11 response and do not consider it to be adequate. Your retrospective review of complaints to determine if a Corrective and Preventive Action was needed appears to have focused solely on complaints involving patient injury. Corrective and Preventive Actions may need to be initiated for reasons other than patient injury. Additionally, your response indicates that you will be issuing a safety update to your customers regarding the device temperature; however, labeling is typically considered the last resort of risk mitigation. We also note that your response did not address the study initiated in March 2012 to (b)(4) (Engineering memo (b)(4)), which appears to indicate your firm was aware of an issue with the Altrus Handpieces and attempted to address it outside of the Corrective and Preventive Action system (the design change in the study has not been implemented). 3.    Procedures to control environmental conditions have not been adequately established, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(c). Your procedure, SOP-176, Facility Practices Procedure (Rev. 0, 1/4/2013), fails to address product disposition when Alert and/or Action Levels are exceeded. SOP-176 WI-02 (Rev. 1, 5/30/2013), Airborne and Surface Contamination Monitoring Procedure, also fails to address product disposition when Alert and/or Action Levels are exceeded.  Specifically, on March 1, 2013, Controlled Environment Air Particulate Counts exceeded Action Levels in (b)(4) areas tested. (b)(4) lots of Altrus Handpieces ((b)(4) and (b)(4) lots of BiCap Hemostasis Probes (b)(4) were being manufactured in the area at the time of the excursion. No evaluation of non-viable particulates was performed on any of the impacted lots. All (b)(4) lots were released for distribution based solely on bioburden testing of a portion of each lot. In addition, on March 25, 2013, Particulate Action Levels were again exceeded in (b)(4) areas tested. (b)(4) lots of Altrus Handpieces were impacted by the excursion (b)(4). These lots were not evaluated for non-viable particulates and were released for distribution based upon bioburden testing of the lots impacted approximately three weeks prior. This procedure of accepting possible nonconforming product based upon prior testing is not documented in any procedure. We have reviewed your October 11, 2013 response and do not consider it to be adequate. The Health Hazard Evaluation (HHE) you referenced in concluding the risk to patients was negligible when bioburden testing was not conducted following the March 25, 2013 excursion was not written until October 2013, approximately seven months after the affected lots were released to distribution.  We also believe your revised procedures may not yet be sufficient to control environmental conditions and assure proper action regarding finished products.  Additionally, regarding non-viable particulate contamination and the potential risk to patients, you have not provided any evidence to demonstrate that you have evaluated the types of particulates that may be introduced onto the devices, the characterization of such particles (e.g. size, shape, and composition), at what point during manufacture they may be introduced, nor have you validated the cleaning procedures for the Altrus Handpieces or BiCap Hemostasis Probes prior to packaging to demonstrate that particulates are effectively removed. We also note that you do not have any established design requirements for particulates on either the Altrus Handpieces or BiCap Hemostasis Probes. We acknowledge that you have initiated a voluntary recall of Altrus Handpiece lot #s 13CHB006 &13CHB007. 4.    Risk analysis is incomplete, per 21 CFR 820.30(g). For example: a.    The Risk Management Plan for the Altrus System (Rev. 0, 6/22/2009) requires review of complaint data to determine if the risk analyses remain complete and adequate. Since release of the Altrus System 5mm and 10mm Handpieces, on 12/06/2010 and 7/13/2011 respectively, your firm has received eight complaints of external burns to patients; however, the Altrus Thermal Tissue Fusion System Level Hazard Analysis (Rev. M, 8/12/2013) fails to address and evaluate the risk of external burns to patients. b.    The packaging procedure for Altrus Tissue Fusion Handpieces. (b)(4), established limits for particulates on packaged finished product as “does not contain embedded particles, stains, scratches, or chips in excess of (b)(4). Embedded particles, stains, scratches or chips larger than (b)(4) are unacceptable.” However, the Altrus Thermal Tissue Fusion System Level Hazard Analysis (Rev. M, 8/12/2013) fails to address the risk to patients due to particulate contamination in the finished devices. On 3/1/2013, (b)(4) nonconformance reports (NCRs) were initiated for (b)(4) lots of Altrus Handpieces that were exposed to environmental particulate counts which exceeded Action Levels during manufacture; (b)(4) lots were released for distribution. c.    The BiCap Probe Hazard Analysis, Document (b)(4) (9/6/2012) and the BiCap Probe Process Failure Modes Effects Analysis (FMEA), Document (b)(4) (3/4/2004) fail to address the risk to patients due to particulate contamination in the finished product. On 3/1/2013, (b)(4) nonconformance reports (NCRs) were initiated for (b)(4) lots of BiCap Probe units ((b)(4) units total) that were exposed to particulate counts which exceeded Action Levels during manufacture; (b)(4) lots were released for distribution.     We have reviewed your October 11, 2013 response, but do not consider it to be adequate.  Regarding the risk of burns to patients, your response references the Altrus Tissue Fusion System Instructions For Use (IFU); however, labeling is typically considered the last resort of risk mitigation. Regarding your response to the issue of particulate contamination and the potential risk to patients, you have not provided any evidence to demonstrate that you have evaluated the types of particulates that may be introduced onto the device, the characterization of such particles (e.g. size, shape, and composition), at what point during manufacture they may be introduced, nor have you validated the cleaning procedures for the Altrus Handpieces or BiCap Hemostasis Probes prior to packaging. Without any knowledge of the type of particles introduced into the environment when the Action Level of (b)(4) was exceeded, we cannot agree that the (b)(4) lots of Altrus Handpieces and (b)(4) lots of BiCap Hemostasis Probes posed no risk to patients when released for distribution. We acknowledge that you have made changes to your risk analysis procedures and that you are preforming a retrospective review of (b)(4) additional product lines. These actions will be reviewed on-site during a future inspection.            5.    Procedures for receiving, reviewing, and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit have not been adequately established, as required by 21 CFR 820.198(a). Specifically, your procedure, Complaint Handling, SOP-013, Rev. 38, does not assure that complaint investigations are complete and consistently documented. For example: a.    The procedure, Complaint Handling, SOP-013, Rev. 38, does not require a review of Device History Records (DHR) for disposable items unless the event is reportable under the Medical Device Reporting regulations, even when the device is returned or the lot number is known. Specifically, (b)(4) of 19 complaints received for Altrus Handpieces between 11/26/2012 and 5/15/2013, showed that lot numbers were provided, but DHRs were not reviewed prior to the complaints being closed. b.    Information recorded on complaint records, (b)(4) was inaccurate, in that the complaint records concluded no corrective action was necessary when, in fact, a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) had been initiated for the issue of detached heaters; the Corrective and Preventive Action document was not referenced in the complaint records. We have reviewed your responses, but do not consider them to be adequate. We acknowledge that you provided a revised complaint procedure for your Utica, NY headquarters, SOP-14-1, Rev. E (10/22/2013).  One of the flow diagrams attached to SOP-14-1 appears to indicate various investigative responsibilities for “TS Denver” including investigation of complaints and completion of a “child investigation” form. Please clarify whether the Centennial, CO procedure, SOP-013 has been rendered obsolete, or whether there are any new/revised complaint procedures covering responsibilities of the Centennial facility during complaint investigations. Regarding the “parent” and “child” forms (completed by Utica, NY and Centennial, CO, respectively), we noted that these often contained conflicting information in terms of whether or not there was a patient injury involved.  We note that you conducted a retrospective complaint review, limited to Altrus Handpieces, for complaints where the device was not returned but the lot number was available ((b)(4)). According to your response, the Device History Records for these devices were reviewed, with the majority marked as “closed” on your summary report. Please clarify whether these complaints were evaluated for identification of possible trends, whether any root causes were identified during the review and also whether any necessary corrective actions were identified. Please also clarify whether you will be expanding the retrospective complaint review to other devices. 6.    Certain inspection and measuring equipment is not suitable for its intended purpose and capable of producing valid results, as required by 21 CFR 820.72(a). Specifically, your firm utilizes (b)(4) to calibrate 5mm and 10mm Altrus Handpieces. Your firm has not demonstrated that this equipment is capable of producing valid results due to the following: a.    No records were available to demonstrate that your method of determining emissivity for the 5mm and 10mm Altrus Handpieces had been validated. b.    Your firm failed to consider the effect of reflected energy, from the opposing heater on the handpiece in terms of how it would affect (b)(4) during calibration of the Altrus Handpieces.  c.    Your firm did not calculate emissivity values in accordance with the (b)(4) manufacturer’s recommendation, in that all (b)(4) recommendations from the manufacturer include use of the (b)(4); however, your firm only used the (b)(4) indirectly and instead relied (b)(4) during studies. Furthermore, the (b)(4) user manual indicates the (b)(4), yet your emissivity studies were conducted while the handpieces were (b)(4). We have reviewed your October 11 response and do not consider it to be adequate. Specifically, your response did not address our concern regarding how the emissivity of (b)(4) was calculated and whether that method of determining the emissivity was validated. Your response indicated that since the inspection, you have determined that the Altrus Handpiece (b)(4) are calibrated (b)(4); however, this is not clear from (b)(4) Test Procedure, nor is it what the investigator was told during the inspection. If you have additional documentation to demonstrate that the (b)(4) are operated (b)(4), please provide that information. Your response also appears to indicate that reflected energy from the opposing handpiece is reduced or eliminated because the opposing heater is “not a source of energy that can be reflected by the heater undergoing calibration.” This statement implies that the opposing heater is actually not activated as the opposing heater is being calibrated. If you have documentation to demonstrate that the opposing heater can be inactivated while the opposing heater is activated for calibration, please provide that information. Regarding the calculation of emissivity values not in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations, based upon the step-by-step progression for determining emissivity values presented in your response, it still appears that the (b)(4) are being used indirectly. This indirect use of the (b)(4) was also acknowledged by a ConMed employee during the inspection. Please indicate whether you consulted with the manufacturer, (b)(4) regarding your in-house method for calculating emissivity prior to implementing it for use, and if so, what input you received. Please also submit a copy of your procedure MP-131-TEMP with your response. 7.    A process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test has not been adequately validated according to established procedures, per 21 CFR 820.75(a). Specifically, your procedure, Manufacturing Qualification Process, SOP-154, requires the validation of processes for which the output cannot be verified. Procedures for the BiCap Hemostasis Probe include a (b)(4). Packaging procedures for the Altrus Handpiece include (b)(4). Neither of these cleaning processes has been validated to demonstrate that they reduce the number of viable and non-viable particulates on the finished products.  We have reviewed your October 11, 2013 response, but do not consider it to be adequate. During the inspection, your firm did not appear to have design requirements for particulate (viable and non-viable) for either the BiCap Hemostasis Probe or the Altrus Handpiece, both of which are sterile devices. Furthermore, an employee stated that your firm did not have a testing method for particulates. Although the packaging procedures for the Altrus reference the (b)(4) standard for particulates, this examination is not recorded. Please clarify if your design requirements for these, and other sterile devices, have specific requirements referenced for particulate (viable and non-viable), and whether you have identified and characterized the non-viable particulates. Please also clarify whether you have demonstrated that the cleaning procedures above reduce the number of particulates, and also whether employees responsible for visually inspecting packaged product have been challenged to demonstrate they can consistently identify particulate of specified size and number in a (b)(4) examination, per the packaging procedure for the Altrus Handpiece. 8.    Procedures have not been adequately established to control product that does not conform to specified requirements, per 21 CFR 820.90(a). Specifically, a.    Your firm failed to initiate a Nonconformance Report (NCR) after the Action Level for particulates (b)(4) was exceeded during the manufacture of Altrus Handpieces, (b)(4), on 3/25/2013. An NCR is required by your Facility Practices Procedure, SOP-0176). Although no NCR was initiated, the (b)(4) lots were released for distribution with no documentation that (b)(4) lot was evaluated for the impact of either viable or non-viable particulates, instead, your firm relied upon bioburden testing from Altrus Handpiece lots manufactured three weeks prior to conclude that lots (b)(4) would not be adversely impacted by the particulate excursion during manufacture. b.    Your Nonconforming Procedure, SOP-074, Rev. 37, states that any documents supporting the evaluation, investigation, and/or disposition decision of NCRs should be referenced and attached to the corresponding (b)(4) document. Review of your NCRs revealed: i.    (b)(4) NCRs were dispositioned without documentation of any investigations or any justification for lack of an investigation.ii.    (b)(4) NCRs regarding problems with product pouch seals, attributed to the (b)(4) pouch sealing machine, failed to include any reference or link to the Corrective and Preventive Action document, (b)(4), which was opened to address the issue. Furthermore, your Quality Engineer Supervisor informed our investigators that investigations are not routinely performed for nonconformance reports unless a trend is noted; however, your procedure does not reference this practice, nor does the procedure identify how a trend is identified/defined. We have reviewed your October 11, 2013 response and it appears to be adequate. However, as all attachments were not provided with the revised NCR forms submitted, we cannot evaluate whether the disposition of the products or any investigation was appropriate. Additionally, we will review any future NCRs during a subsequent inspection to determine if you are following your procedures and if nonconformances are being appropriately investigated and dispositioned. 9.    Acceptance activities were not documented and maintained as part of the device history record as required by 21 CFR 820.80(e). For example: a.    (b)(4) Altrus Handpieces, (b)(4), did not meet acceptance criteria, in that (b)(4) handpiece did not include any results for the temperature verification test and (b)(4) exceeded the temperature verification maximum of (b)(4). The Product Acceptance and Production Order Records Review, SOP-110, requires that Device History Records be reviewed for completeness and that product is held until any discrepancies are resolved; however, the (b)(4) handpieces were released for distribution with no indication that that discrepancies were noted or resolved. b.    (b)(4) device history records reviewed for Altrus (b)(4) failed to include documentation of all required in-process acceptance activities. We have reviewed your October 11, 2013 response and although it appears to be adequate, during a future inspection, we will review the validation of the electronic system that you are currently developing for the collection and review of verification data. Additionally, your response indicates that you are revising approximately 53 device manufacturing procedures to clarify certain in-process requirements. We will review the changes during a future inspection to fully assess the adequacy of your corrective action. 510(k) Our inspection has revealed that the Altrus Tissue Fusion System is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because you do not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. §360j(g). The Altrus Tissue Fusion System is also misbranded under section 501(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because you did not notify the agency of your intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, in that a notice or other information respecting the modification to the device was not provided to the FDA as required by section 510(k), 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)(i). Specifically, your firm has implemented the following design changes to the Altrus Tissue Fusion System (510(k) number KI101534):(b)(4)(b)(4) (b)(4), which has potential to impact its (b)(4). Additionally, the combined impact of the above-mentioned design changes could appreciably (b)(4) device as originally designed. As such, the design changes as listed above represent significant changes in the technology and performance of the device, requiring the submission of a new 510(k). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. [21 CFR 807.81(b)] The kind of information you need to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for your device is described on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm. The FDA will evaluate the information you submit and decide whether your product may be legally marketed. FDA requests that ConMed Electrosurgery immediately cease activities that result in the misbranding or adulteration of the Altrus Tissue Fusion System, such as the commercial distribution of the device for the uses discussed above. Misbranding Our inspection also revealed that your firm’s Altrus Thermal Tissue Fusion system devices are misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the device that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360i, and 21 CFR Part 806 – Medical Devices; Reports of Corrections and Removals. Significant violations include, but are not limited to, the following: Failure to submit a written report to FDA of a correction or removal of a device that was initiated to remedy a violation of the Act caused by the device that may present a risk to health, unless the information has already been provided as set forth in 21 CFR 806.10(f) or the correction or removal action is exempt from the reporting requirements under 806.1(b), as required by 21 CFR 806.10(a) (2). For example: a)    Your firm failed to report a correction or removal of the Altrus Thermal Tissue Fusion system initiated to remedy a violation of the act caused by the device which may present a risk to health without notifying FDA. These device modifications/ design changes may present a risk to health and must be reported as a correction or removal. Our inspection also revealed that the Altrus Thermal Tissue Fusion System is misbranded under section 502(t)(2) of the Act 21 USC 352(t)(2), in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the devices that is required by or under section 519 of the Act, 21 USC 360i, and 21 CFR Part 803 – Medical Device Reporting (MDR) Regulation. Significant deviations include, but are not limited to: b)    Failure of your firm to adequately develop, maintain and implement written MDR procedures, as required by 21 CFR 803.17.  After reviewing your firm’s MDR procedure titled “Adverse Event Reporting”, SOP-041, Rev 35, April 2012, the following issues were noted: i)  SOP-041, Rev 35, does not establish internal systems that provide for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of events that may be subject to MDR requirements.  For example:The procedure omits definitions for the terms “reasonably known” and “reasonably suggests,” found respectively in 21 CFR 803.50(b) and 803.20(c)(1). The exclusion of these terms from the procedure may lead your firm to make an incorrect reportability decision when evaluating a complaint that may meet the criteria for reporting under 21 CFR 803.50(a).  ii)  SOP-041, Rev 35, does not establish internal systems that provide for timely transmission of complete medical device reports. Specifically, the following are not addressed:Instructions for how to obtain and complete the FDA 3500A form.The procedure does not include the address for where to submit MDR reports: FDA, CDRH, Medical Device Reporting, P.O.
