Our pizza dough is hand tossed to perfection. Your taste buds will be delighted with our Saputo cheese and specialty Alta Cucina tomatoes, which give our pizza pies and slices an addictive flavor. We want you to think of Spicy Pie when you think of the best pizza in Fargo-Moorhead, Minot, and Grand Forks.

Our selection of meats – sausage, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, beef and more – were chosen to best compliment our pizzas unique flavors.
In addition, the salsa and taco meat you order are created from the most savory ingredients and seasonings. Add all of this up, throw in a great experience, and you’ll be addicted. Visit us at any of our locations, including Fargo, West Fargo, Moorhead, Grand Forks, or Minot. Be prepared to find your new favorite pizza place.
