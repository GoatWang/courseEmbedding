INVESTMENT SUMMARY                                                              
------------------                                                              

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

The trust seeks to provide current interest income and capital preservation.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its objective.                     

 PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The trust seeks to provide high current interest income and capital         
preservation by investing in a portfolio consisting primarily of interest-      
bearing corporate debt obligations rated investment grade quality as of the     
trust's inception.  The portfolio was selected by Navellier & Associates, Inc.  
(the "Portfolio Consultant").  Dial Capital Management, LLC ("Dial") provided   
assistance to the Portfolio Consultant in connection with selection of the      
portfolio.  The Portfolio Consultant selected the bonds in the portfolio after  
detailed credit analysis in an effort to create a portfolio that it believes can
maintain adequate cash flow and good asset liability balances.                  

Investment grade corporate bonds are rated BBB- or higher by Standard &     
Poor's or Baa3 or higher by Moody's Investor Service.  Certain corporate bonds  
held by the trust may be rated as investment grade by only one credit rating    
organization and either unrated or below investment grade by the other.  These  
ratings are based upon an evaluation by a credit rating organization of the     
corporation's credit history and ability to repay obligations.  An investment   
grade rating generally signifies that a credit rating agency considers the      
current quality of a bond to be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of   
the issuer's ability to meet its obligation to bondholders.                     

 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  BOND PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over time.

*  THE VALUE OF THE BONDS WILL GENERALLY FALL IF INTEREST RATES, IN GENERAL,    
RISE.  No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the 
future.                                                                   

*  A BOND ISSUER MAY BE UNABLE TO MAKE INTEREST AND/OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENT IN THE 
FUTURE.                                                                   
*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY    
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.       

*  A BOND ISSUER MIGHT PREPAY OR "CALL" A BOND BEFORE ITS STATED MATURITY.  If  
this happens, the trust will distribute the principal to you but future   
interest distributions will fall.  A bond's call price could be less than 
the price the trust paid for the bond.  If enough bonds are called, the   
trust could terminate earlier than expected.                              

*  THE TRUST IS CONSIDERED TO BE CONCENTRATED IN SECURITIES ISSUED BY COMPANIES 
 IN THE FINANCIALS SECTOR.  Negative developments in this sector will affect
the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more        
diversified investment.                                                   

*  WE<F1>* DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited             
 circumstances, the trust will hold, and may continue to buy, the same bonds
even if the market value declines.                                        

--------------------

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year            $361                                      
3 years           $415                                      
5 years           $469                                      
10 years          $605                                      

These amounts are the same regardless of whether you sell your investment at
the end of a period or continue to hold your investment.

 ILLUSTRATION OF SALES FEE DISCOUNTS

 We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales fee you pay when you
buy units.  The table below shows what the public offering price per unit,      
estimated current return and estimated long-term return would have been as of   
the close of business on the business day prior to the trust's inception date   
based on certain sales fee levels.  Please refer to "Understanding Your
Investment--How to Buy Units--Reducing Your Sales Fee" for details on the       
applicability of and guidelines associated with all sales fee discounts.        
Please refer to "Understanding Your Investment--How Your Trust Works--Estimated
Current and Long-Term Returns" for more information about estimated current and 
long-term returns. The public offering price per unit and interest income       
received by the trust will vary over time for various reasons.  There is no     
assurance that the estimated current returns or estimated long-term returns     
will be realized in the future.

Notes to Portfolio                                                              

(1)  The securities are represented by contracts to purchase such securities the
performance of which is secured by an irrevocable letter of credit.   
 Contracts to acquire the securities were entered into during the period
from October 21, 2014 to October 23, 2014 and have expected settlement
dates during the period from October 24, 2014 to October 28, 2014.    

(2)  The bonds may be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant
     to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur.

(3)  This is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and 
the call price for that year.  Each bond continues to be callable at  
   declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original
issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue
 price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption
     date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in
subsequent years.  "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with
    respect to an issue of bonds.  The bonds may also be subject to redemption
     without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory
redemptions if certain events occur.                                  

(4)  The cost of each security is based on the current offering side evaluation 
     as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the business day prior to
the trust's inception date.  During the initial offering period,      
  evaluations of securities are made on the basis of current offering side
 evaluations of the securities.  The aggregate offering price is greater
     than the aggregate bid price of the securities, which is the basis on which
  redemption prices will be determined for purposes of redemption of units
     after the initial offering period.  In accordance with Accounting Standards
  Codification 820, "Fair Value Measurements", the trust's investments are
 classified as Level 2, which refers to security prices determined using
significant observable inputs when quoted prices in active markets for
    identical securities are not available.  Observable inputs are inputs such
as quoted prices for similar securities, quoted prices for identical  
securities in markets that are not active, and other inputs that are  
   observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  The cost of
    the securities to the sponsor and the sponsor's profit or (loss) (which is
  the difference between the cost of the securities to the sponsor and the
cost of the securities to the trust) are $14,392,940 and $39,157,     
respectively.                                                         

(5)  This security has a "make whole" call option and is redeemable in whole or 
    in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that
  is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of the security, a
 "make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
   redemption.  The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if
 any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of
    principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest
accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if    
redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining 
    principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond
     and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations
with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a
     premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have
   been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate
principal amount of the bonds being redeemed.                         

(6)  Any bond marked with this note has been purchased on a "when, as and if    
   issued" or "delayed delivery" basis.  Delivery of these bonds is expected
to take place at various dates after the first settlement date of the 
trust, which is normally three business days following the trust's    
    inception date.  Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of
unitholders on the related delivery dates for the bonds.              

(7)  Any bond marked with this note was issued at an original issue discount.   

(8)  This is a bond issued by a foreign company.                                

  Corporate bonds comprise approximately 100.00% of the investments in the
trust, broken down by country of organization as set forth below:     

Cayman Islands         9.20%                      
Isle of Mann           4.15%                      
Luxembourg             4.27%                      
United States         82.38%                      

(9)  This bond is subject to potential interest rate adjustments, not to exceed 
   2.00 percentage points above the bond's original interest rate, if either
Moody's Investor Service or Standard & Poor's (or, in certain limited 
  circumstances, another ratings service) downgrades their rating for this
  bond (or upgrades the rating after such a downgrade).  The interest rate
     set forth here represents the current interest rate applicable to the bond.

(10) The interest rate payable on this bond was adjusted in the past by a       
one-time increase due to a ratings downgrade related to a corporate   
     acquisition. Any future credit rating improvements may result in a decrease
 in the interest rate payable on this bond.  The interest rate set forth
here represents the current interest rate applicable to the bond.

HOW TO BUY UNITS

You can buy units of a trust on any business day the New York Stock Exchange
is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are available   
daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMLIVE.COM.  When you buy units, you pay the      
public offering price of units plus accrued interest, if any.  The public       
offering price of units includes:                                               

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  cash to pay organization costs plus                                      

*  the sales fee.                                                           

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in a trust reduced by the liabilities of a trust divided by the total    
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all   
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock     
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized       
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly      
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive   
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the  
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by   
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then  
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer    
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It 
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the  
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may  
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.          

 ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the units represents an amount of cash deposited to pay the costs of creating   
your trust.  These costs include the costs of preparing the registration        
statement and legal documents, federal and state registration fees, the         
Portfolio Consultant's security selection fee, the initial fees and expenses of 
the trustee and the initial audit.  Your trust will reimburse us for these costs
at the end of the initial offering period or after six months, if earlier.  The 
value of your units will decline when the trust pays these costs.               

ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a security
from the last day it paid interest.  Accrued interest on the trust units        
consists of two elements.  The first element arises as a result of accrued      
interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on bonds in the trust from
the last day on which interest was paid on the bonds.  Interest on the bonds is 
generally paid semi-annually, although the trust accrues such interest daily.   
Because your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet          
collected, the public offering price of units will have added to it the         
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement.  The second  
element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of the trust's      
interest account.  The trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until
it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust and may be required to  
advance its own funds to make trust interest distributions.  As a result,       
interest account balances are established to limit the need for the trustee to  
advance funds in

P-->4879th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
connection with such interest distributions.  If you sell or redeem your units  
you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest
from the purchaser of your units.                                               

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities during the    
initial offering period based on the aggregate offering side evaluations of the 
securities determined (a) on the basis of current offering prices of the        
securities, (b) if offering prices are not available for any particular         
security, on the basis of current offering prices for comparable securities, (c)
by determining the value of securities on the offer side of the market by       
appraisal, or (d) by any combination of the above.  After the initial offering  
period ends, we generally determine the value of the securities as described in 
the preceding sentence based on the bid side evaluations rather than the        
offering side evaluations.  The offering side price generally represents the    
price at which investors in the market are willing to sell a security and the   
bid side evaluation generally represents the price that investors in the market 
are willing to pay to buy a security.  The bid side evaluation is lower than the
offering side evaluation.  As a result of this pricing method, unitholders      
should expect a decrease in the net asset value per unit on the day following   
the end of the initial offering period equal to the difference between the      
current offering side evaluation and bid side evaluation of the securities.     

Capelogic, Inc., an independent pricing service, determined the initial     
prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in this prospectus as described
above at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the     
business day before the date of this prospectus.  On the first day we sell units
we will compute the unit price as of the close of regular trading on the New    
York Stock Exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the       
Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective, if later.                 

SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.  We refer to 
this fee as the "sales fee."  The maximum sales fee equals 3.00% of the public  
offering price per unit at the time of purchase.  You pay the initial sales fee 
at the time you buy units.                                                      

MINIMUM PURCHASE.  The minimum amount you can purchase of the trust appears 
on page 3 under "Essential Information", but such amounts may vary depending on 
your selling firm.                                                              

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.  Except as expressly provided herein, you may
not combine discounts.                                                          

Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of   
your investment:                                                                

IF YOU PURCHASE:        YOUR FEE WILL BE:

$250,000 - $499,999           2.50

 We apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the
time of purchase.  The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into consideration  
purchase orders stated in dollars which

cannot be completely fulfilled due the requirement that only whole units be     
issued.                                                                         

You aggregate initial offering period unit orders submitted by the same     
person for units of any of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one 
broker-dealer to qualify for a purchase level.  If you purchase initial offering
period units that qualify for the fee account or exchange discount described    
below and also purchase additional initial offering period units on a single day
from the same broker-dealer that do not qualify for the fee account or exchange 
discount, you aggregate all initial offering period units purchased for purposes
of determining the applicable breakpoint level in the table above on the        
additional units, but such additional units will not qualify for the fee account
or exchange discount described below.  Secondary market unit purchases are not  
aggregated with initial offering period unit purchases for purposes of          
determining the applicable breakpoint level.  You can also include these orders 
as your own for purposes of this aggregation:                                   

*  orders submitted by your spouse or children (including step-children)    
under 21 years of age living in the same household and                

*  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.             

The discounts described above apply only to initial offering period         
purchases.                                                                      

Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment   
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each 
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for         
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management 
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for 
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed. You should     
consult your financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from   
these accounts.  If units of the trust are purchased for a Fee Account and the  
units are subject to a Wrap Fee in such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap   
Fee Eligible"), then investors may be eligible to purchase units of the trust in
these Fee Accounts at the public offering price less the regular underwriter or 
dealer concession.                                                              

 This discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary
market.  Certain Fee Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees
on the purchase and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other      
processing organizations for providing certain transaction or account           
activities.  We reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee    
Accounts by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is       
determined to be detrimental to the trust.                                      

Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by      
officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of the sponsor 
and its affiliates.  We also waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made
by officers, directors and employees (and immediate family members) of selling  
firms.  These purchases are made at the public offering price per unit less the 
applicable dealer concession.  Immediate family members for the purposes of this
section include your spouse, children (including step-children) under the age of
21 living in the same household, and parents (including step-parents).  These   
discounts apply to initial offering period and secondary market purchases.  All 
employee discounts are subject to the policies of the related

selling firm, including but not limited to, householding policies or            
limitations.  Only officers, directors and employees (and their immediate family
members) of selling firms that allow such persons to participate in this        
employee discount program are eligible for the discount.                        

Exchange Option.  We waive a portion of the sales fee on units of the trust 
offered in this prospectus if you buy your units with redemption or termination 
proceeds from any unit investment trusts (regardless of sponsor).  The          
discounted public offering price per unit for these transactions is the regular 
public offering price per unit less 0.50%.  However, if you use redemption or   
termination proceeds to purchase $250,000 or more in the trust, the maximum     
sales fee on your units will be limited to the maximum sales fee for the        
applicable amount invested in the table under "Large Purchases" above.  To      
qualify for this discount, the termination or redemption proceeds used to       
purchase units of the trust offered in this prospectus must be derived from a   
transaction that occurred within 30 calendar days of your purchase of units of  
the trust offered in this prospectus.  In addition, the discount will only be   
available for investors that utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different     
broker-dealer with appropriate notification) for both the unit purchase and the 
transaction resulting in the receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds  
used for the unit purchase.  You may be required to provide appropriate         
documentation or other information to your broker-dealer to evidence your       
eligibility for this sales fee discount.                                        

Please note that if you purchase units of a trust in this manner using      
redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining        
deferred sales fee at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales   
fee remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption proceeds.   
These discounts apply only to initial offering period purchases.                

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-    
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional 
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMLIVE.COM or through your financial    
professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the net asset 
value per unit, provided that you will not pay organization costs if you sell or
redeem units during the initial offering period.  The sale and redemption price 
is sometimes referred to as the "liquidation price".  Certain broker-dealers may
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit redemption or sale        
requests.                                                                       

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value, provided that you will not pay organization costs if you sell units      
during the initial offering period.  We may then resell the units to other      
investors at the public offering price or redeem them for the redemption price. 
Our secondary market repurchase price is the same as the redemption price.      
Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a secondary market in units.  You    
should contact your financial professional for current repurchase prices to     
determine the best price available.  We may discontinue our secondary market at 
any time without notice.  Even if we do not make a market, you

will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any business day for the  
current redemption price.                                                       

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.    
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset  
value per unit, provided that you will not pay organization costs if you redeem 
units during the initial offering period.  You will receive the net asset value 
for a particular day if the trustee receives your completed redemption request  
prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.           
Redemption requests received by authorized financial professionals prior to the 
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange that are properly       
transmitted to the trustee by the time designated by the trustee, are priced    
based on the date of receipt.  Redemption requests received by the trustee after
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, redemption requests
received by authorized financial professionals after that time or redemption    
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the trustee until 
after the time designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of the   
next determined redemption price provided they are received in a timely manner  
by the trustee on such date.  It is the responsibility of authorized financial  
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the trustee so
they will be received in a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a 
timely manner or is incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset  
value computed after the trustee receives your completed request.               

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our   
other unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial       
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges.  Before you exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully 
and understand the risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with    
your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have     
changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We   
may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice.                             

 DISTRIBUTIONS

MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays interest from its net     
investment income (pro-rated on an annual basis) along with any available       
principal paid on the securities on each monthly distribution date to           
unitholders of record on the preceding record date.  The record and distribution
dates are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary"       
section of this prospectus.  In some cases, your trust might pay a special      
distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution.  The 
amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as interest and        
principal payments change or trust expenses change.                             

                                            Understanding Your Investment     11

P-->48713th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�13th
Interest received by your trust, including that part of the proceeds of any 
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
trustee to your trust's "interest account".  Other receipts are credited to the 
"principal account".  After deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the    
trustee, without interest, for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as  
the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date, interest received will
be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the     
preceding record date.  All distributions will be net of estimated expenses.    
Funds in the principal account will be distributed on each distribution date to 
unitholders of record as of the preceding record date provided that the amount  
available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per unit.         

Because interest payments are not received by your trust at a constant rate 
throughout the year and the interest rates on certain bonds in the trust may    
adjust periodically, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the interest account as of the record date.  For the purpose of     
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts.  The trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the  
interest account on the next record date.  Investors who purchase units between 
a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on  
the second distribution date after the purchase.                                

ESTIMATED DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual interest income per unit,
estimated initial distribution per unit and estimated normal monthly            
distribution per unit as of the close of business the day before your trust's   
inception date are shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment
Summary" section of this prospectus.  We generally base these amounts on the    
estimated cash flows of the bonds per unit based on the current interest rate   
applicable to the bonds.  Since certain of the bonds may be subject to potential
interest rate adjustments related to changes in the bonds' ratings provided by  
certain ratings services, estimated distributions may fluctuate over time and   
actual distributions may vary from estimated amounts.  The actual distributions 
that you receive will vary from these estimates with changes in expenses,       
interest rates (including interest rate adjustments related to changes in the   
bonds' ratings as provided by certain ratings services) and maturity, call,     
default or sale of bonds.  You may request the estimated cash flows from the    
sponsor.  The estimated cash flows are computed based on factors described under
"Understanding Your Investment--How Your Trust Works--Estimated Current and
Long-Term Returns".                                                             

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each        
distribution.  Each year the trustee or your financial professional will also   
provide an annual report on your trust's activity and certain tax information.  
You can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your   
tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust, if available.        

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price or below the principal value.  Market value fluctuates in        
response to various factors.  These can include changes in interest rates,      
inflation, the financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of the   
issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even though we supervise your portfolio, you 
should remember that we do not manage your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell 
a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed    
fund.                                                                           

INTEREST RATE RISK is the risk that the value of securities will fall if    
interest rates, in general, increase.  The securities in your trust typically   
fall in value when interest rates, in general, rise and rise in value when      
interest rates, in general, fall.  Securities with longer periods before        
maturity are often more sensitive to general interest rate changes.             

 Certain bonds in the portfolio may be subject to interest rate adjustments if
either Moody's Investor Services or Standard & Poor's (or, in certain limited   
circumstances, another ratings service) downgrades the rating for such bond (or 
upgrades the rating after such a downgrade).  The interest rates payable on     
certain bonds in the portfolio may have already been increased due to past      
ratings downgrades.  Any future credit rating improvements on such bonds may    
result in decreases to the interest rates payable on such bonds and,            
consequently, may adversely affect both the income you receive from the         
securities in your trust and the value of your units.  On the other hand,       
increases in a bond's interest rate related to decreases in such bond's credit  
rating may place additional financial strain on the bond's issuer which could   
result in further decreases in financial condition and further credit rating    
decreases.  Additionally, an increase in a bond's interest rate may increase the
risk that the bond's issuer will prepay or "call" the bond before its stated    
maturity.                                                                       

 CREDIT RISK is the risk that a security's issuer or insurer is unable to meet
its obligation to pay principal or interest on the security.                    

CALL RISK is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its  
stated maturity.  An issuer might call a bond if interest rates, in general fall
and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for 
the original purpose.  If an issuer calls a bond, your trust will distribute the
principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall.  You might   
not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield.  A bond's call price 
could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the
bond's par value.  This means that you could receive less than the amount you   
paid for your units.  If enough bonds in your trust are called, your trust could
terminate early.  Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary 
optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain      
changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other     
casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and      
various other events.  The call provisions are described in general terms in the
"Portfolio".                                                                    

BOND QUALITY RISK is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating    
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

CONCENTRATION RISK is the risk that the value of your trust is more         
susceptible to fluctuations based on factors that impact a particular industry  
because the portfolio concentrates in companies within that industry.  A        
portfolio "concentrates" in an industry when securities in a particular industry
make up 25% or more of the portfolio.

The trust invests significantly in securities issued by companies in the    
FINANCIALS SECTOR.  Any negative impact on this industry will have a greater    
impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several       
industries.  You should understand the risks of this industry before you invest.

Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse     
effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans; and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business.  In addition, banks  
and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and   
state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.  Banks face 
increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes 
permit new entrants to offer various financial products.  Technological advances
such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead 
and permit the more efficient use of customer data.  Banks are already facing   
tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial      
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally
offered by banks.                                                               

Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are 
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general.  Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and 
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely 
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies.

 Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses 
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could         
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management   
and brokerage industries.  Companies involved in investment management and      
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government 
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect the stock prices of such companies.                            

 Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management industry
underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business insurance.  Many 
factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management company profits,      
including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium rate caps, a       
misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings, competition and   
pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other disasters and the   
effects of client mergers.  Already extensively regulated, insurance companies' 
profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law
changes.                                                                        

Financial services companies faced significant difficulty related to the    
downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets, corresponding declines in 
the value of mortgage-backed securities and the resulting impact on all areas of
the financial services industry and the broader economy.  These difficulties    
have given rise to considerable uncertainty regarding the global economy and    
financial services companies, in particular.  The downturn also led to          
considerable write-downs in the values of many assets held by financial services
companies and a tightening of credit markets that has been marked by a general  
unwillingness of many entities to extend credit.                                

14     Understanding Your Investment                                            

P-->48716th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
These factors caused a significant need for many financial services companies to
raise capital to meet obligations and to satisfy regulatory and contractual     
capital requirements.  Many well-established financial services companies were  
forced to seek additional capital through issuances of new preferred or common  
equity and certain companies were forced to agree to be acquired by other       
companies (or sell some or all of their assets to other companies).  In some    
cases government assistance, guarantees or direct participation in investments  
or acquisitions have been necessary to facilitate these transactions.  In       
addition, concerns regarding these issues and their potential negative impact to
the U.S. and global economies have resulted in extreme volatility in securities 
prices and uncertain market conditions.                                         

In response to these issues, government authorities in the U.S. and other   
countries have initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and       
legislative action, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer    
Protection Act and resulting rulemaking intended to address both short- and     
long-term difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets, mortgage
backed securities, the financial services industry and the broader economy.     
These government actions include, but are not limited to, restrictions on       
investment activities; increased oversight, regulation and involvement in       
financial services company practices; adjustments to capital requirements; the  
acquisition of interests in and the extension of credit to private entities; and
increased investigation efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in
the financial service industry.  No one can predict any action that might be    
taken or the effect any action or inaction will have.  It is possible that any  
actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the    
state of these difficulties as intended.  No one can predict the impact that the
recent difficulties will have on the economy, generally or financial services   
companies.  The recent difficulties and corresponding government action or      
inaction may have far reaching consequences and your investment may be adversely
affected by such developments.                                                  

LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security because these securities generally   
trade in the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities       
exchange).                                                                      

LITIGATION AND LEGISLATION RISK is the risk that future litigation or       
legislation could affect the value of your trust.  Litigation could challenge an
issuer's authority to issue or make payments on securities.                     

FOREIGN ISSUER RISK.  Because the trust invests in securities of foreign    
companies, the trust involves additional risks that differ from an investment   
exclusively in securities of domestic issuers.  These risks include the risk of 
losses due to future political and economic developments, international trade   
conditions, foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments   
and exchange of securities.  The trust also involves the risk that fluctuations 
in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively 
affect the value of the securities.  The trust involves the risk that           
information about the securities is not publicly available or is inaccurate due 
to the absence of uniform accounting and financial reporting standards.  In     
addition, some foreign securities markets are less liquid than U.S. markets.    
This could cause the trust to buy securities at a higher price or sell          
securities at a lower price than would be the case in a highly liquid market.   
Foreign securities markets are often more volatile and involve higher trading   
costs than U.S. markets, and foreign companies, securities markets and brokers  
are also generally not

subject to the same level of supervision and regulation as in the U.S.          

"WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  "When, as and if issued" bonds 
are bonds that trade before they are actually issued.  Bonds purchased on a     
"when issued" basis have not yet been issued by the issuer on the trust's       
inception date although such issuer has committed to issue such bonds.  This    
means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust "when, as and if" the 
bonds are actually issued.  In addition, other bonds may have been purchased by 
the sponsor on a "delayed delivery" basis.  These bonds are expected to be      
delivered to the trust after the trust's first settlement date (normally three  
business days after the trust's inception date).                                

Delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these 
bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the bond is delivered to the  
trust.  You may have to adjust your tax basis of any bonds delivered after the  
expected delivery date.  Any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued     
between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your 
trust.  This could lower your first year estimated current return.  You may     
experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even 
though your trust has not yet received them.                                    

ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Original issue discount bonds were initially
issued at a price below their face (or par) value.  These bonds typically pay a 
lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par
value.  In a stable interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds  
tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the   
bonds approach maturity.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or     
redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the      
bond's par value.                                                               

 Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond.  These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life.  If an investor owns this type  
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's par
value at maturity.  The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during    
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments.  The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a  
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

MARKET DISCOUNT.  Your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market 
values were below the principal value on the trust's inception date or your unit
purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such bonds being less  
than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a lower  
rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds.  Bonds selling
at market discounts tend to increase in market value as they approach maturity. 

PREMIUM BONDS.  Your trust may consist of some bonds whose current market   
values were above the principal value on the trust's inception date or your unit
purchase date.  A primary reason for the market value of such bonds being higher
than the principal value is that the interest rate of such bonds is at a higher 
rate than the current market interest rates for comparable bonds.  The current  
returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the      
current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest     
rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach   
maturity when the principal value becomes payable.  Because part of the purchase
price is effectively returned not at

P-->48718th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a premium bond
at par or any other amount below the trust's purchase price will result in a    
reduction in yield.  Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and 
redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the     
bonds have a market value that represents a premium over par or for original    
issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value.                    

HOW YOUR TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and    
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities   
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to us.     
Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.  These  
units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.  The    
number of units, fractional interest of each unit in a trust, estimated interest
distributions per unit and estimated current and long-term returns will increase
or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.                                    

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will   
generally buy and sell securities:                                              

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect a trust,                             

 *  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on a trust, or

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  Your trust will generally reject   
any offer for securities or other property in exchange for the securities in its
portfolio.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will either 
hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or      
property and distribute the proceeds.                                           

We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create   
additional units, we will seek to maintain a portfolio that replicates the      
principal amounts of the securities in the portfolio.  When your trust buys     
securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You could          
experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and fluctuations 
in security prices between the time we create units and the time your trust buys
the securities.  Because the trusts pay the brokerage fees associated with the  
creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and    
exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result 
in higher brokerage expenses.  When your trust buys or sells securities, we may 
direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage commissions to brokers that  
sell units or are affiliated with your trust or the trustee.                    

 In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been purchased for the
trust under a contract ("failed bonds"), the sponsor is authorized to purchase  
other bonds ("replacement bonds").  The trustee shall pay for replacement bonds 
out of funds held in connection with the failed bonds and will accept delivery  
of such                                                                         

                                            Understanding Your Investment     17

P-->48719th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
bonds to make up the original principal of a trust.  The replacement bonds must 
be purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract,
and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the       
principal attributable to the failed bonds.  Whenever a replacement bond has    
been acquired for a trust, the trustee shall, within five days thereafter,      
notify all unitholders of a trust of the acquisition of the replacement bond and
shall, on the next distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter, make
a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost to a trust of  
the failed bond exceeded the cost of the replacement bond.  In addition, a      
replacement bond must (at the time of purchase):                                

 *  have a fixed maturity or disposition date comparable to that of the failed
bond it replaces;                                                     

*  be purchased at a price that results in a yield to maturity and in a     
   current return which is approximately equivalent to the yield to maturity
and current return of the failed bond which it replaces; and          

*  be rated at least in the category of BBB/Baa or the equivalent by a major
rating organization.                                                  

If the right of limited substitution described above shall not be used to   
acquire replacement bonds in the event of a failed contract, the sponsor will   
refund the sales charge attributable to such failed bonds to all unitholders of 
the trust, and distribute the principal attributable to such failed bonds on the
next monthly distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter.  In the   
event a replacement bond is not acquired by the trust, the estimated net annual 
interest income per unit would be reduced and the estimated current and long-   
term returns might be lowered.                                                  

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS.  The estimated current return and  
the estimated long-term return as of the business day before a trust's inception
date are shown under "Essential Information" and "Illustration of Sales Fee
Discounts" in the "Investment Summary" section for your trust.  Estimated       
current return is calculated by dividing the current estimated net annual       
interest income per unit based on the interest rates currently applicable to the
bonds by the public offering price.  The estimated net annual interest income   
per unit will vary with changes in the interest rates applicable to the bonds   
(some of which may be subject to adjustments related to changes in the bonds'   
ratings as provided by certain ratings services), fees and expenses of your     
trust and with the default, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds.    
The public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present estimated current return    
will be realized in the future.  Estimated long-term return is calculated using 
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the 
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with units.  The applicable sales charge associated with units
will vary based on sales fee reductions applicable to certain unitholders.      
Since the interest rates, value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the  
expenses of your trust may change, there is no assurance that the present       
estimated long-term return will be realized in the future.  The estimated       
current return and estimated long-term return are expected to differ because the
calculation of estimated long-term return reflects the estimated date and amount
of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes   
only net annual interest income and public offering price.

In order to acquire certain bonds, it may be necessary for the sponsor or   
trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the  
amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on   
the trust's inception date.  This cash may exceed the interest which would      
accrue to the first settlement date.  The trustee has agreed to pay for any     
amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become  
available from interest payments on the related bonds.                          

WEIGHTED AVERAGE MODIFIED DURATION.  The weighted average modified duration 
of the securities in the trust portfolio as of the business day before the      
trust's inception date is shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment
Summary" section for your trust.  Modified duration is a calculation that       
expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a     
change in interest rates.  Modified duration follows the concept that interest  
rates and bond prices move in opposite directions.  This formula is used to     
determine the effect that a 1% change in interest rates might have on the price 
of a bond.  For example, if a portfolio has a duration of 3 years then that     
portfolio's value is estimated to decline approximately 3% for each 1% increase 
in interest rates or rise approximately 3% for each 1% decrease in interest     
rates.  Weighted average modified duration of the securities will vary with     
changes in the value and yield of bonds and with the default, redemption,       
maturity, exchange, sale or other liquidation of bonds.  The weighted average   
modified duration of the securities shown under "Essential Information" relates 
only to the bonds in the trust and not to the trust itself or units.  Modified  
duration does not account for the trust sales charge or expenses and is not     
intended to predict or guarantee future performance of the bonds or the trust.  

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect 
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change 
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.      
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this  
agreement.                                                                      

TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate upon the maturity,    
payment, redemption, sale or other liquidation of all of the securities in the  
portfolio.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the trust
is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at the    
time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an undue  
burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your    
trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will liquidate   
the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold to the    
public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of a trust would be    
reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time they were   
deposited in a trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales charge that you
paid.                                                                           

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to   
broker-dealers, registered representatives,

adviser, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA)  
and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the   
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform  
our duties as sponsor or become bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue  
to operate your trust without a sponsor, or terminate your trust.               

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in  
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or  
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and       
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in  
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for  
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and   
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a         
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports  
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an     
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the      
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have 
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or        
director for the issuers of the securities.                                     

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust with 
its principal unit investment trust division offices located at 2 Hanson Place, 
12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the trustee by calling   
the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or by writing to its  
unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the trustee in some    
cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by notifying us and    
investors.                                                                      

PORTFOLIO CONSULTANT.  The Portfolio Consultant, Navellier & Associates,    
Inc., is a privately owned registered investment adviser.  Louis G. Navellier is
the majority owner of the Portfolio Consultant which was founded in 1987 and is 
based in Reno, Nevada.  In addition to providing portfolio consulting services  
to the trust, the Portfolio Consultant provides investment management services  
to individuals, Taft-Hartley plans, corporate pension funds, endowments, and    
foundations.  The Portfolio Consultant is not an affiliate of the sponsor.  The 
Portfolio Consultant selected a list of bonds to be included in the portfolio   
based on the criteria provided by the sponsor. The Portfolio Consultant makes no
representations that the bond portfolio will achieve the investment objectives  
or will be profitable or suitable for any particular potential investor.  The   
sponsor did not select the bonds for the trust.                                 

The Portfolio Consultant may use the list of bonds in its independent       
capacity as an investment

adviser and distribute this information to various individuals and entities.    
The Portfolio Consultant may recommend to other clients or otherwise effect     
transactions in the bonds held by the trust.  This may have an adverse effect on
the prices of the bonds.  This also may have an impact on the price the trust   
pays for the bonds and the price received upon unit redemptions or liquidation  
of the bonds.  The Portfolio Consultant also issues reports and makes           
recommendations on securities, which may include the bonds in the trust.        

 Neither the Portfolio Consultant nor the sponsor manages the trust.  Opinions
expressed by the Portfolio Consultant are not necessarily those of the sponsor, 
and may not actually come to pass.  The Portfolio Consultant is being           
compensated for its portfolio consulting services, including selection of the   
trust portfolio.                                                                

The Portfolio Consultant has a consulting agreement with Dial which covers  
the assistance provided for the portfolio selection for the trust among other   
things.  Dial is not being compensated by the trust or the sponsor.  Dial is a  
privately owned investment adviser registered in the state of California.  Dial 
was founded in 2002 and is based in Newport Coast, California.  The principals  
of Dial are T. Ole Dial and Mike Lanier, who combined have over 45 years        
experience in the credit markets.  Dial provides investment management services 
primarily to hedge funds and high net worth individuals.  Dial is not an        
affiliate of the sponsor.                                                       

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  Units will be distributed to the public by these firms at the 
public offering price per unit as described under "How to Buy Units".           

During the initial offering period, the distribution fee (the broker-dealer 
concession or agency commission) for broker-dealers and other firms is as       
follows:

$250,000 - $499,999                1.75

 We apply these concessions as a percent of the public offering price per unit
at the time of the transaction.  The breakpoints will be adjusted to take into  
consideration purchase orders stated in dollars which cannot be completely      
fulfilled due to the requirement that only whole units be issued.               

For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts who  
use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase units of the trust     
offered in this prospectus, the concession or agency commission is 1.75% of the 
public offering price per unit.  After the initial offering period, the broker- 
dealer concession or agency commission for secondary market transactions is     
equal to 2.50% of the public offering price.  No distribution fee is paid to    
broker-dealers, investment advisers or other selling firms in connection with   
unit sales in Fee Accounts that charge a Wrap Fee.                              

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the concession or agency commission, except as stated above.  We reserve the    
right to change the amount of

Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of certain unit investment   
trusts for which AAM acts as sponsor are eligible to receive additional         
compensation for volume sales.  The sponsor offers two separate volume          
concession structures for certain trusts that are referred to as "Volume        
Concession A" and "Volume Concession B."  The trust offered in this prospectus  
is a Volume Concession B trust.  Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units 
of any Volume Concession B trust are eligible to receive the additional         
compensation described below.  Such payments will be in addition to the regular 
concessions paid to firms as set forth in the applicable trust's prospectus. The
additional concession is based on total initial offering period sales of all    
Volume Concession B trusts during a calendar quarter as set forth in the        
following table:

 This volume concession will be paid on units of all Volume Concession B trust
units sold in the initial offering period, except as described below.

Municipal Portfolio and Tax Exempt Securities Trust are classified as Volume    
Concession B trusts; however, other trusts may be classified as Volume          
Concession B trusts in the future and eligible for this additional compensation 
for calendar quarter sales as disclosed in the applicable trust prospectus.  For
a trust to be eligible for this additional Volume Concession B compensation for 
calendar quarter sales, the trust's prospectus must include disclosure related  
to this additional Volume Concession B compensation.  A trust is not eligible   
for this additional Volume Concession B compensation if the prospectus for such 
trust does not include disclosure related to this additional Volume Concession B
compensation.  Other trusts sponsored by AAM are eligible to receive different  
categories of additional compensation for volume sales as set forth in the      
applicable trust's prospectus.  Broker dealer-firms will not receive            
compensation unless they sell at least $100 million of units of Volume          
Concession B trusts during a calendar quarter.  For example, if a firm sells    
$99.5 million of units of Volume Concession B trusts during a calendar quarter, 
the firm will not receive any additional compensation with respect to such      
trusts.  Once a firm reaches a particular breakpoint during a quarter, the firm 
will receive the stated volume concession on all initial offering period sales  
of Volume Concession B trust units during the applicable quarter.  For example, 
if a firm sells $115 million of units of Volume Concession B trusts in the      
initial offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive        
additional compensation of 0.05% of $115 million and if a firm sells $275       
million of units of Volume Concession B trusts in the initial offering period   
during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive additional compensation of     
0.10% of $275 million.  In addition, selling firms will not receive the         
additional compensation on the sale of units which are not subject to a         
transactional sales charge.  However, such sales will be included in determining
whether a firm has met the volume                                               

22     Understanding Your Investment

sales concession breakpoints subject to the policies of the related selling     
firm.  Secondary market sales of units are excluded for purposes of the         
additional compensation.  We will pay these amounts out of our own assets within
a reasonable time following each calendar quarter.                              

We currently provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits,        
additional compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this   
trust and our other products.  This compensation is intended to result in       
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales.  A number of factors are considered in determining     
whether to pay these additional amounts.  Such factors may include, but are not 
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary, the     
level or expected level of sales of our products by the intermediary or its     
agents, the placing of our products on a preferred or recommended product list  
and access to an intermediary's personnel.  We may make these payments for      
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited to,      
expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisors, advertising,  
sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information about the breakdown of 
unit sales among an intermediary's representatives or offices, obtaining shelf  
space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities designed to promote the sale
of our products.  We make such payments to a substantial majority of            
intermediaries that sell our products.  We may also make certain payments to, or
on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion of their costs incurred for the
purpose of facilitating unit sales, such as the costs of developing or          
purchasing trading systems to process unit trades.  Payments of such additional 
compensation described in this paragraph and the volume concessions described   
above, some of which may be characterized as "revenue sharing," may create an   
incentive for financial intermediaries and their agents to sell or recommend our
products, including this trust, over other products.  These arrangements will   
not change the price you pay for your units.                                    

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not       
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be      
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in     
part.                                                                           

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to      
create units.                                                                   

 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions  
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,   
and has not

reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the    
assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be sufficient for you to use 
for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                    

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment      
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated     
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's         
distributions into three categories, ordinary income distributions, capital     
gains dividends and return of capital.  Ordinary income distributions are       
generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, 
certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at   
the capital gains tax rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gains       
dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your 
units.  To determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends,
you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after   
considering all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In     
addition, the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital   
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status 
of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest   
your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from
your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is   
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws  
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had     
received them on December 31 of the previous year.  Under the "Health Care and  
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income from the trust may also be subject
to a 3.8 percent "medicare tax".  This tax will generally apply to your net     
investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold       
amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples filing joint returns 
and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.                                 

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will 
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is   
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.  
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to    
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be     
reported by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.   

SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will    
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this    
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to 
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,      
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.   

CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are 
an individual, the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain
is generally 20% for taxpayers in the 39.6% tax bracket, 15% for taxpayers in   
the

25%, 28%, 33% and 35% tax brackets and 0% for taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax  
brackets.  Capital gains may also be subject to the "medicare tax" described    
above.                                                                          

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the date you
purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you receive a
capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding
it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term capital
loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The tax rates for    
capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the  
same as for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital  
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over  
into a future trust, the exchange would generally be considered a sale for      
federal income tax purposes.                                                    

DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your    
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In some cases,   
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as   
income.  In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses. 
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions  
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.  Some individuals may also 
be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions,   
depending on their income.                                                      

 FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust 
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to      
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.                   

FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other  
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal     
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust properly reports as   
capital gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including     
withholding taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However,     
distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly   
reported by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S.      
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust makes
certain elections and certain other conditions are met.  In addition,           
distributions in respect of units may be subject to a U.S. withholding tax of   
30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-U.S. financial institutions 
that have not entered into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to collect and   
disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has    
entered into such an agreement with the U.S. Treasury and (ii) certain other    
non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain certifications and information    
about the entity's U.S. owners.  Dispositions of units by such persons may be   
subject to such withholding after December 31, 2016.  You should also consult   
your tax advisor with respect to other U.S. tax withholding and reporting       
requirements.

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.               

Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),      
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the  
sponsor, legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs 
incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.    
Your trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.  
Your trust will pay a license fee for the use of certain service marks,         
trademarks, trade names and/or other property of Navellier & Associates, Inc.   
and Dial Capital Management, LLC.  The trustee will generally pay trust expenses
from interest income and principal payments received on the securities but in   
some cases may sell securities to pay trust expenses.

ADVISORS DISCIPLINED TRUST 1243                                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the
trust portfolio on pages 5 and 6, of Advisors Disciplined Trust 1243, as of     
October 24, 2014, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial      
condition is the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is  
to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our     
audit.                                                                          

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public      
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require    
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  We were 
not engaged to perform an audit of the trust's internal control over financial  
reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial 
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the trust's internal control over financial reporting.         
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of 
financial condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant   
estimates made by the sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall statement of   
financial condition presentation.  Our procedures included confirmation with The
Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit    
deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of financial 
condition as of October 24, 2014.  We believe that our audit of the statement   
of financial condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.             

In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined
Trust 1243 as of October 24, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles     
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the offer side evaluations as         
     determined by the evaluator.  The trustee will advance the amount of net           
     interest accrued to the first settlement date to the trust for distribution        
     to the sponsor as unitholder of record as of such date.                            
(2)  Cash or an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited with the trustee        
     covering the funds (aggregating $15,500,000) necessary for the purchase of         
     securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.                         
(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to          
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the trust.          
     These costs have been estimated at $3.80 per unit for the trust.  A                
     distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial            
     offering period or six months following the trust's inception date to an           
     account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation of the                
     investors will be satisfied.  To the extent the actual organization costs          
     are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization             
     costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the sponsor         
     and deducted from the assets of the trust.                                         
(4)  The sales fee is equal to 3.00% of the public offering price.                      
(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming         
     no reduction of sales fees.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset  
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).                                                            

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  The number of units, fractional interest of each unit in   
the trust and estimated interest distributions per unit will increase or        
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or   
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of 
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with           
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued 
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,  
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the    
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be     
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities  
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in principal       
amounts which will generally maintain the same original percentage relationship 
among the principal amounts of the securities in such trust established by the  
initial deposit of the securities.  Thus, although additional units will be     
issued, each unit will generally continue to represent the same principal amount
of each security, and the percentage relationship among the principal amount of 
each security in the related trust will generally remain the same.  If the      
sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities, existing and new       
investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in     
their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities
between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and     
because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.                       

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any   
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions 
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.      
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure  
in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase of any 
of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, unless 
substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are    
reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement,     

 -2-

P-->48732nd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all       
unitholders on the next distribution date.                                      

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

 The trust seeks to provide monthly distributions of interest income and
capital preservation by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of        
investment grade interest-bearing corporate debt obligations.  There is, of     
course, no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective.  The prospectus 
provides additional information regarding the trust's objective and investment  
strategy.                                                                       

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in the special circumstances discussed herein
regarding the substitution of replacement securities for any failed securities. 
Thus, with the exception of the redemption or maturity of securities in         
accordance with their terms, the assets of a trust will remain unchanged under  
normal circumstances.                                                           

  The sponsor may direct the trustee to dispose of securities the value of
which has been affected by certain adverse events including institution of      
certain legal proceedings or decline in price or the occurrence of other market 
factors, including advance refunding, so that in the opinion of the sponsor the 
retention of such securities in a trust would be detrimental to the interest of 
the unitholders.  The proceeds from any such sales, exclusive of any portion    
which represents accrued interest, will be credited to the Principal Account of 
such trust for distribution to the unitholders.                                 

     The sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of securities to issue new securities, or to exchange securities, for 
trust securities, the trustee shall reject such offer.  However, should any     
issuance, exchange or substitution be effected notwithstanding such rejection or
without an initial offer, any securities or property received shall be deposited
in the trust and shall be promptly sold by the trustee unless the sponsor       
advises the trustee to keep such securities or properties.  The excess cash     
proceeds of any such sales will be distributed to unitholders.                  

If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,    
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the 
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor 
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee 
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in 
the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.   
The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is
the direct result of serious adverse credit                                     

 -3-

P-->48733rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
factors which, in the opinion of the sponsor, would make retention of the       
securities detrimental to the trust.  In such a case, the sponsor may, but is   
not obligated to, direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other         
securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trust's     
inception date. The sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action        
necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications  
of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has     
elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.                          

  The trustee may sell securities, designated by the sponsor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.                                                            

   In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further    
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to   
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the     
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal  
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of 
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Principal   
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.                                             

     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in          
accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be   
distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can be given
that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and            
composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for
any default, failure or defect in any security.  In the event of a failure to   
deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract,      
including those securities purchased on a "when, as and if issued" basis        
("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to   
direct the trustee to acquire other securities ("Replacement Securities") to    
make up the original corpus of such trust.                                      

    Securities in certain of the trusts may have been purchased on a "when, as
and if issued" or delayed delivery basis with delivery expected to take place   
after the first settlement date.  Accordingly, the delivery of such securities  
may be delayed or may not occur.  Interest on these securities begins accruing  
to the benefit of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery.            
Unitholders of all trusts will be "at risk" with respect to any "when, as and if
issued" or "delayed delivery" securities included in their respective trust     
(i.e., may derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of    
such securities) from the date they commit for units.                           

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The Replacement Securities (i) shall be bonds,          
debentures, notes or other straight debt obligations (whether secured or        

 -4-

P-->48734th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
unsecured and whether senior or subordinated) without equity or other conversion
features, with fixed maturity dates substantially the same as those of the      
Failed Securities, having no warrants or subscription privileges attached;      
(ii) shall be payable in United States currency; (iii) shall not be "when, as   
and if issued" obligations or restricted securities; (iv) shall be issued after 
July 18, 1984 if interest thereon is United States source income; (v) shall be  
issued or guaranteed by an issuer subject to or exempt from the reporting       
requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934   
(or similar provisions of law) or in effect guaranteed, directly or indirectly, 
by means by of a lease agreement, agreement to buy securities, services or      
products, or other similar commitment of the credit of such an issuer to the    
payment of the Replacement Securities; (vi) if the prospectus for the related   
trust provides that an objective of such trust is to provide income exempt from 
United States federal taxation, shall be securities issued by states or         
territories of the United States or political subdivisions thereof which shall  
have the benefit of an exemption from United States federal taxation of interest
to an extent equal to or greater than that of the Securities they replace and,  
if the prospectus for the related trust provides that an objective of such trust
is to provide income exempt from state taxation, shall have the benefit of an   
exemption from state taxation to an extent equal to or greater than that of the 
Securities they replace; and (vii) shall not cause the units of the related     
trust to cease to be rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-
Hill Companies, Inc. if the units are so rated. The purchase price of the       
Replacement Securities (exclusive of accrued interest) shall not exceed the     
principal attributable to the Failed Securities. In addition, no substitution of
Replacement Securities will be made without an opinion of counsel that such     
substitution will not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the     
related trust, if such Replacement Securities when added to all previously      
purchased Replacement Securities in the related trust exceed 15% of the         
principal amount of Securities initially deposited in the related trust.        
Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for a trust, the trustee shall,     
within five days thereafter, notify all unitholders of the trust of the         
acquisition of the Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly          
distribution date which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata        
distribution of the amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed
Security exceeded the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the        
securities in a trust are acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the  
investments of the trust, i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to    
take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholder's investment.       

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
principal and accrued interest attributable to such Failed Securities not more  
than 30 days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to    
purchase a Replacement Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that,
at the time of receipt of such principal, they may not be able to reinvest such 
proceeds in other securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield which
such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust.                  

   Whether or not a Replacement Security is acquired, an amount equal to the
accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed Securities) will be paid to  
unitholders of the trust to the date the sponsor removes the Failed Securities  
from the trust if the sponsor determines not to purchase a Replacement Security 
or to the date of substitution if a Replacement Security is purchased.  All such
interest paid to unitholders which accrued after the date of settlement for a   

 -5-

P-->48735th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
purchase of units will be paid by the sponsor.  In the event a Replacement      
Security could not be acquired by a trust, the net annual interest income per   
unit for such trust would be reduced and the estimated current return and       
estimated long-term return might be lowered.                                    

  Subsequent to the trust's inception, a security may cease to be rated or
its rating may be reduced below any minimum required as of the trust's          
inception.  Neither event requires the elimination of such investment from a    
trust, but may be considered in the sponsor's determination to direct the       
trustee to dispose of such investment.                                          

The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust except upon the    
happening of certain extraordinary circumstances.  Certain of the securities may
be subject to optional call or mandatory redemption pursuant to sinking fund    
provisions, in each case prior to their stated maturity.  A bond subject to     
optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to       
maturity at the option of the issuer, often at a premium over par.  A refunding 
is a method by which a bond issue is redeemed, at or before maturity, by the    
proceeds of a new bond issue.  A bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one 
which is subject to partial call from time to time at par with proceeds from a  
fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue to       
maturity.  Special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for       
redemption at par of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances.  Redemption pursuant to optional call provisions is more likely  
to occur, and redemption pursuant to special or extraordinary redemption        
provisions may occur, when the securities have an offering side evaluation which
represents a premium over par, that is, when they are able to be refinanced at a
lower cost.  The proceeds from any such call or redemption pursuant to sinking  
fund provisions, as well as proceeds from the sale of securities and from       
securities which mature in accordance with their terms from a trust, unless     
utilized to pay for units tendered for redemption, will be distributed to       
unitholders of such trust and will not be used to purchase additional securities
for such trust.  Accordingly, any such call, redemption, sale or maturity will  
reduce the size and diversity of a trust and the net annual interest income of  
such trust and may reduce the estimated current return and the estimated long-  
term return.  The call, redemption, sale or maturity of securities also may have
tax consequences to a unitholder.                                               

   Certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may have been acquired
at a market discount from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest rates on  
the discount securities at the time they were purchased and deposited in the    
trusts were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds 
of comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for newly issued         
comparable securities increase, the market discount of previously issued        
securities will become greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued     
comparable securities decline, the market discount of previously issued         
securities will be reduced, other things being equal.  Investors should also    
note that the value of securities purchased at a market discount will increase  
in value faster than securities purchased at a market premium if interest rates 
decrease.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of securities      
purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than securities purchased at
a market premium.  In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of  
higher yielding, premium securities and the prepayment benefit for lower        
yielding, discount securities will be reduced.  A discount security held to     
maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable  
income and capital gain and loss in the form of tax-exempt interest income than 
a comparable security newly issued at current market                            

 -6-

P-->48736th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
rates.  Market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a    
lack of market confidence in the issue.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee    
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any of the     
securities.                                                                     

     Certain of the securities in the trust may be "zero coupon" bonds, i.e., an
original issue discount bond that does not provide for the payment of current   
interest.  Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer 
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments.  The effect of owning deep 
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
obligation.  This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates 
the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as 
high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time     
eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future.  For 
this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price       
fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are          
securities of comparable quality which pay interest currently.                  

   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security which might reasonably be   
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

   MARKET DISCOUNT.  Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market
discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on discount bonds
at the time they were purchased and deposited in a trust were lower than the    
current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and   
type. If such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase, the    
market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater, and if such     
interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of
previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors    
should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will    
increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest   
rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the value of bonds      
purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a   
market premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the prepayment risk of     
higher yielding, premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding,   
discount bonds will be reduced. Market discount attributable to interest changes
does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue.  Neither the sponsor
nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in
any of the bonds.                                                               

PREMIUM BONDS.  Certain of the bonds held by the trust may have been  
acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity.  The coupon interest   
rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the trust were    
higher than the current market interest rates for

newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type.  If such interest rates for   
newly issued and otherwise comparable bonds decrease, the market premium of     
previously issued bonds will be increased, and if such interest rates for newly 
issued comparable bonds increase, the market premium of previously issued bonds 
will be reduced, other things being equal.  The current returns of bonds trading
at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable 
bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because   
premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when   
the face amount becomes payable.  Because part of the purchase price is thus    
returned not at maturity but through current income payments, early redemption  
of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a     
reduction in yield.  Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will, and 
redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at times when the     
redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over  
par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value.     

   ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT BONDS.  Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon"
bonds. Zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer     
receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond  
and does not receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep  
discount bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero    
coupon bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original          
investment but also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such  
obligation. This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates  
the risk of being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as 
high as the implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time     
eliminates the holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For  
this reason, zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price       
fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are          
securities of comparable quality which pay interest.                            

    "WHEN ISSUED" AND "DELAYED DELIVERY" BONDS.  Certain of the bonds may have
been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. See   
"Notes to Portfolio" in the prospectus. The delivery of any such bonds may be   
delayed or may not occur. Interest on these Bonds begins accruing to the benefit
of unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. To the extent any bonds   
are actually delivered to a trust after their respective expected dates of      
delivery, unitholders who purchase their unit prior to the date such bonds are  
actually delivered to the trustee would be required to adjust their tax basis in
their unit for a portion of the interest accruing on such bonds during the      
interval between their purchase of unit and the actual delivery of such bonds.  
As a result of any such adjustment, the Estimated Current Returns during the    
first year would be slightly lower than those stated in the Prospectus which    
would be the returns after the first year, assuming the portfolio of a trust and
estimated annual expenses other than that of the trustee (which may be reduced  
in the first year only) do not vary from that set forth in the prospectus.      
Unitholders will be "at risk" with respect to all bonds in the portfolios       
including "when, as and if issued" and "delayed delivery" bonds (i.e., may      
derive either gain or loss from fluctuations in the evaluation of such bonds)   
from the date they commit for unit.                                             

  FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. Your trust may concentrate in securities of
issuers in the financial services industry.

 Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans; and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business.  In addition, banks  
and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and   
state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.  Banks will 
face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory    
changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul legislation,
permit new entrants to offer various financial products.  Technological advances
such as the Internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead 
and permit the more efficient use of customer data.  Banks are already facing   
tremendous pressure from mutual funds, brokerage firms and other financial      
service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally
offered by banks.                                                               

     Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general.  Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and 
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely 
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies.
Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new   
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses 
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could         
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management   
and brokerage industries.  Companies involved in investment management and      
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government 
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect the stock prices of such companies.                            

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management  
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance.  Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
company profits, including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium   
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
disasters and the effects of client mergers.  Already extensively regulated,    
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government  
regulations or tax law changes.                                                 

   Financial services companies have faced significant difficulty related to
the downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets, corresponding declines
in the value of mortgage-backed securities and the resulting impact on all areas
of the financial services industry and the broader economy.  These difficulties 
have given rise to considerable uncertainty regarding the global economy and    
financial services companies, in particular.  The downturn has also led to      
considerable write-downs in the values of many assets held by financial services
companies and a tightening of credit markets that has been marked by a general  
unwillingness of many entities to extend credit.  These factors have caused a   
significant need for many financial services companies to raise capital to meet 
obligations and to satisfy regulatory and contractual capital requirements.     
Many well-established financial services companies have been forced to seek     
additional capital through issuances of new preferred or common equity and      
certain companies have been forced to agree to be acquired by other companies   
(or sell some or all of their assets to

other companies).  In some cases government assistance, guarantees or direct    
participation in investments or acquisitions have been necessary to facilitate  
these transactions.    In addition, concerns regarding these issues and their   
potential negative impact to the U.S. and global economies have resulted in     
extreme volatility in securities prices and uncertain market conditions.        

   In response to these issues, government authorities in the U.S. and other
countries have initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and       
legislative action intended to address both short- and long-term difficulties   
facing the housing and mortgage lending markets, mortgage backed securities, the
financial services industry and the broader economy.  These government actions  
may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on investment activities;     
increased oversight, regulation and involvement in financial services company   
practices; adjustments to capital requirements; the acquisition of interests in 
and the extension of credit to private entities; and increased investigation    
efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in the financial service  
industry.  No one can predict any action that might be taken or the effect any  
action or inaction will have.  It is possible that any actions taken by         
government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these      
difficulties as intended.  No one can predict the impact that the difficulties  
will have on the economy, generally or financial services companies.  The       
difficulties and corresponding government action or inaction may have far       
reaching consequences and your investment may be adversely affected by such     
developments.                                                                   

Banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal    
regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation 
as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on 
the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore,
bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their        
supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the        
permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant
risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit 
insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital    
requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums    
required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance       
Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a       
company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental
regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their   
holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in the securities  
issued by such institutions.                                                    

  The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in the past. To a great extent, these changes are  
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,    
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The Gramm-Leach-   
Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks, securities firms   
and insurance companies to form one-stop financial conglomerates marketing a    
wide range of financial service products to investors. This legislation will    
likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among     
existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to liberalize interstate
banking has also                                                                

-10-

been enacted. Under the legislation, banks are able to purchase or establish    
subsidiary banks in any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been allowed to turn  
existing banks into branches. Consolidation may continue. The Securities and    
Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board require the    
expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules         
requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts  
or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in increased
volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated regulatory      
intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and regulatory    
changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory authorities have   
proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending 
laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as to the effect, if 
any, that such changes would have on the Securities in the Trust's portfolio. In
addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by Congress
and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that system could, among other  
things, further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks
or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor.    
Such reforms could reduce profitability, as investment opportunities available  
to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings      
vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face significant competition from other
financial institutions such as mutual funds, credit unions, mortgage banking    
companies and insurance companies, and increased competition may result from    
legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers. Among
other benefits, such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to     
acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their       
various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter
makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of bank regulatory actions might
ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the    
Trust's portfolio.                                                              

 The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

   The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by                                   

-11-

P-->48741st�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
borrowing. The FRB also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a 
condition to its approval of certain applications, including applications for   
approval of mergers and acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter   
makes any prediction as to the effect, if any, such laws will have on the       
Securities or whether such approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.           

 Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,  
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes  
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health 
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest    
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial  
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,       
competitive pressures, including increased competition from new and existing    
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need 
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the 
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage          
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and self-       
regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the  
interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect the   
stock prices of such companies.                                                 

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management  
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the      
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in     
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather      
catastrophes or other natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client   
mergers. Individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve
inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance    
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the       
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of  
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect       
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and profitability. In        
addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies continue to shrink 
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital  
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.            

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

 *  the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property-liability
  loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed
  established loss reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on
results of operations and financial condition;                        

-12-

P-->48742nd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
 *  the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be expected in
    the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could have a material
 adverse impact on their financial conditions, results of operations and
cash flow;                                                            

 *  the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property-liability
   loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim
settlement practices;                                                 

*  the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain      
    appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in light
of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance    
regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable financial 
strength or claims-paying ability ratings;                            

*  the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are
subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;              

  *  the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value
     of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of
certain of its products; and                                          

 *  the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and
the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables.                       

 The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered
or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to      
regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance    
regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing
on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of 
new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated  
the condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine       
whether to promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to   
predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the  
nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any,
such legislation would have on the industry.                                    

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-    
admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some        
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

    The value of securities issued by financial services companies may also be
affected by the downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets,           
corresponding declines in the value of mortgage backed securities and the       
resulting impact on all areas of the financial services industry.  In response, 
government authorities have initiated and may continue to engage in             
administrative and legislative action intended to address both short- and long- 
term difficulties facing the                                                    

-13-

P-->48743rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
housing and mortgage lending markets, mortgage backed securities, the financial 
services industry and the broader economy.  These government actions may        
include, but are not limited to, restrictions on investment options, increased  
oversight, regulation and involvement in financial services company practices,  
adjustments to capital requirements, the acquisition of interests in and the    
extension of credit to private entities and increased investigation efforts into
the actions of companies and individuals in the financial service industry.  No 
one can predict the action that might be taken or the effect any action or      
inaction will have and it is possible that any actions taken by government      
authorities will not address or help improve the state of these difficulties as 
intended.  The downturn and corresponding government action may have far        
reaching consequences into many geographic regions and areas of financial       
services companies and, consequently, the value of securities in the portfolio  
may decline in response to such developments.                                   

    CONSUMER PRODUCT AND SERVICES INDUSTRY. The trust may invest significantly
in bonds of issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products or provide       
consumer services. The profitability of these companies will be affected by     
various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending
trends. In the past, there have been major changes in the retail environment due
to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in  
the retail industry, particularly the department store segment. The continued   
viability of the retail industry will depend on the industry's ability to adapt 
and to compete in changing economic and social conditions, to attract and retain
capable management, and to finance expansion. Weakness in the banking or real   
estate industry, a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in
employment growth, less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked            
deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in          
significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence, adversely 
affecting consumer spending habits. In addition, competitiveness of the retail  
industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation  
of automated checkout equipment to control inventory, to track the sale of      
individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns. Increasing        
employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the       
industry. In many sectors of the retail industry, competition may be fierce due 
to market saturation, converging consumer tastes and other factors. Because of  
these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other         
countries, various retailers are now entering global markets which entail added 
risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies, difficulty in adapting to  
local conditions and constraints and added research costs.                      

INDUSTRIALS ISSUERS. The trust may invest significantly in industrials
companies. General risks of industrials companies include the general state of  
the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international     
politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital    
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending  
levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization,       
limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations, government regulations,
government contracts and ecommerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies  
involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting        
irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial        
results, and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny.         

-14-

Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to
their individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject  
to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.   
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.

MATERIALS. The trust may invest significantly in securities issued by 
companies involved in the materials industry.  Companies in the materials sector
are engaged in the manufacture, mining, processing, or distribution of raw      
materials and intermediate goods used in the industrial sector. These may       
include materials and products such as chemicals, commodities, forestry         
products, paper products, copper, iron ore, nickel, steel, aluminum, precious   
metals, textiles, cement, and gypsum. Materials companies may be affected by the
volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, import controls, worldwide      
competition, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for safety and   
pollution control devices. In addition, they may be adversely affected by       
technical progress, labor relations, and governmental regulation. These         
companies are also at risk for environmental damage and product liability       
claims. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of  
over-building or economic downturns, which may lead to poor investment returns. 

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the cash deposit and the    
purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage
fees and other acquisition costs.                                               

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

    DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Interest received by a trust, including any
portion of the proceeds from a disposition of securities which represents       
accrued interest, is credited by the trustee to the Interest Account for the    
trust.  All other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate Principal  
Account for the trust.  The trustee normally has no cash for distribution to    
unitholders until it receives interest payments on the securities in the trust. 
On the dates set forth under "Essential Information" in the prospectus, the     
trustee will commence distributions, in part from funds advanced by the trustee.

       Thereafter, assuming the trust retains its original size and composition,
after deduction of the fees and expenses and reimbursements (without interest)  
to the trustee for any amounts advanced to a trust, the trustee will normally   
distribute any income and principal received by the trust on each distribution  
date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding            

-15-

P-->48745th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�45th
Record Date.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their   
pro rata share of the balance of the Interest Account.  However, interest earned
at any point in time will generally be greater than the amount actually received
by the trustee.  Therefore, there will generally remain an item of accrued      
interest that is added to the daily value of the units.  If unitholders sell or 
redeem all or a portion of their units, they will be paid their proportionate   
share of the accrued interest to, but not including, the third business day     
after the date of a sale or to the date of tender in the case of a redemption.  

 Unitholders of record on the first record date will receive an interest
distribution on the first distribution date.  Because the period of time between
the first distribution date and the regular distribution dates may not be a full
period, the first regular distributions may be partial distributions.           

  Persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date
will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date following 
their purchase of units.  Since interest on securities in the trust is payable  
at varying intervals and distributions are made to unitholders at different     
intervals from receipt of interest, the interest accruing to a trust may not be 
equal to the amount of money received and available for distribution from the   
Interest Account.  Therefore, on each distribution date the amount of interest  
actually deposited in the Interest Account and available for distribution may be
slightly more or less than the interest distribution made.  In order to         
eliminate fluctuations in interest distributions resulting from such variances, 
the trustee is authorized by the trust agreement to advance such amounts as may 
be necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts.  
The trustee will be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from    
funds available in the Interest Account.                                        

The trustee will distribute on each distribution date or shortly      
thereafter, to each unitholder of record on the preceding record date, an amount
substantially equal to such holder's pro rata share of the available cash       
balance, if any, in the Principal Account computed as of the close of business  
on the preceding record date.  However, no distribution will be required if the 
balance in the Principal Account is less than $1.00 per unit.                   

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Interest Account:                                                

(1) Income received;

(3) The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,    
      expressed in each case both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar

the trust and for redemptions of units, if any; and           

     (3) The balance remaining after such distributions and deductions expressed
       both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount representing the

year;                                                         

(2) The number of units outstanding on the last business day of such  
calendar year;                                                

(3) The redemption price based on the last evaluation made during such
calendar year;                                                

(4) The amount actually distributed during such calendar year from the
      Interest and Principal Accounts separately stated, expressed both as
        total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per unit outstanding on the
record dates for each such distribution.                      

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as 
a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has 
elected to be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of    
1986, as amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an              

-17-

association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the     
trust has not elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under the   
United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement   
may not be amended, however, without the consent of all unitholders then        
outstanding, so as (1) to permit, except in accordance with the terms and       
conditions thereof, the acquisition hereunder of any securities other than those
specified in the schedules to the trust agreement or (2) to reduce the          
percentage of units the holders of which are required to consent to certain of  
such amendments.  The trust agreement may not be amended so as to reduce the    
interest in a trust represented by units without the consent of all affected    
unitholders.  Except for the amendments, changes or modifications described     
above, neither the sponsor nor the trustee may consent to any other amendment,  
change or modification of the trust agreement without the giving of notice and  
the obtaining of the approval or consent of unitholders representing at least 66
2/3% of the units then outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may     
reduce the aggregate percentage of units the holders of which are required to   
consent to any amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without 
the consent of the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the      
affected trust and in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter  
the rights to the unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee    
with the power to engage in business or investment activities other than as     
specifically provided in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax      
status of the trust for federal income tax purposes or result in the units being
deemed to be sold or exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the
trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal     
income tax purposes, result in a variation of the investment of unitholders in  
the trust.  The trustee will notify unitholders of the substance of any such    
amendment.                                                                      

The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
maturity, liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the       
securities held in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the       
mandatory termination date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the     
applicable minimum value stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total   
value of securities deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), 
the trustee may, in its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, 
terminate the trust.  A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of   
units representing 66 2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.    A trust    
will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units
of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor, so that   
the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the
securities at the time they were deposited in the trust. If a trust is          
liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the sponsor, the sponsor
will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee paid by such        
purchaser.                                                                      

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof their pro rata    
share of the balances remaining in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the   
trust.                                                                          

   THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject
to supervision and examination by the Superintendent

of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal     
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law.                                     

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.                              

    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The 
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a     
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after        
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent            
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor.  In case at any time the       
trustee shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or    
shall become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the      
premises shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in  
an involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any  
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for the  
trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the sponsor, 
or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred either (1) a 
material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or (2) one or more
grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect to a trust, the  
sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the trustee and      
appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written instrument, in 
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and   
one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution of a written       
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,       
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the        
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the   
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise  
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided  
profits of not less than $5,000,000.

   THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
The sponsor is a broker-dealer specializing in providing services to broker-    
dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other financial    
professionals. The sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,  
Monument, Colorado 80132. You can contact the unit investment trust division at

Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Securities Investor         
Protection Corporation (SIPC), and a registrant of the Municipal Securities     
Rulemaking Board (MSRB).                                                        

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of   
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such      
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as        
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the     
trust agreement.                                                                

THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the   
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor 
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor  
and trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.     
Such resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of           
appointment by the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no
successor has accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of           
resignation, the evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for   
the appointment of a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and      
appointment shall be mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                  

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or        
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale  
of any securities.                                                              

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

-20-

P-->48750th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best information available to it, provided, 
however, that the evaluator shall be under no liability to the trustee or       
unitholders for errors in judgment, but shall be liable for its gross           
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless disregard for its   
obligations under the trust agreement.                                          

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

   The sponsor may receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. The amount, if any, of  
this "creation and development fee" is set forth in the prospectus. The trustee 
will deduct this amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial 
offering period. No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of            
distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be
deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of    
units before the close of the initial public offering period.                   

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Principal and Interest Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest       
bearing and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part
of the trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result 
from the use of these funds.                                                    

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor   
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate  
cost to the sponsor for providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any  
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based  
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                              

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as    
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the     
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during  
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at   
the end of each month.

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when 
combined with all compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the  
sponsor acts as sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate  
cost of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of
units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period,   
except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units    
outstanding at the end of each month.                                           

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Interest Account of the related trust to the extent funds are 
available and then from the Principal Account.  Each such fee (other than any   
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders  
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.                                      

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon         
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable   
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the     
trust.  If the balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient 
to provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell  
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or     
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration  
statement each year.                                                            

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  During the initial offering period, the public offering price   
per unit is equal to the net asset value per unit (generally based on the       
offering side evaluations of the securities) plus the applicable sales fee      
referred to in the prospectus plus cash deposited to pay organization costs. The
transactional sales fee is equal to the difference between the maximum sales fee
and the total remaining creation and development fee, if any.  The public       
offering price for secondary market transactions, on the other hand, is based on
the net asset value per unit (generally based on the bid side evaluations of the
securities) plus a sales fee.  The sales fee as a percentage of the public      
offering price and the net amount invested is set forth in the prospectus.  The 
creation and development fee, if any, is a fixed dollar amount and will be      
collected at the end of the initial offering period as described in the         
prospectus.  Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the                   

-22-

P-->48752nd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
entire applicable creation and development fee has been collected will not be   
assessed the remaining creation and development fee at the time of such sale or 
redemption.  During the initial offering period, a portion of the public        
offering price includes an amount of cash or securities to pay for all or a     
portion of the costs incurred in establishing a trust.  These costs include the 
cost of preparing the registration statement, the trust indenture and other     
closing documents, registering units with the Securities and Exchange Commission
and states, the initial audit of the trust portfolio, legal fees and the initial
fees and expenses of the trustee.  These costs will be deducted from a trust as 
of the end of the initial offering period or after six months, if earlier.      
Following the end of the initial offering period, the public offering price for 
secondary market transactions is based on the net asset value per unit          
(generally based on the bid side evaluations of the securities) plus a sales    
fee. The cost to investors of units of the trust for secondary market           
transactions is the public offering price of units plus accrued interest, if    
any. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing
unit purchases.                                                                 

As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the 
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of     
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation 
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of 
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised     
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and  
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such       
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   
each such day as discussed in the prospectus.  Orders received by the trustee,  
sponsor or any authorized financial professionals for purchases, sales or       
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is    
closed, will be held until the next determination of price as discussed in the  
prospectus.                                                                     

  Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering    
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus. 
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or  
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of 
the underlying securities and the amount of accrued interest on the units.  Net 
asset value per unit is determined by dividing the value of a trust's portfolio 
securities (including any accrued interest), cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities (including accrued expenses), by the total number of units          
outstanding.  The portfolio securities are valued at their current market value 
or their fair value as determined in good faith by the Evaluator.  The aggregate
bid and offering side evaluations of the securities shall be determined (a) on  
the basis of current bid or offering prices of the securities, (b) if bid or    
offering prices are not available for any particular security, on the basis of  
current bid or offering prices for comparable securities, (c) by determining the
value of securities on the bid or offer side of the market by appraisal, or     
(d) by any combination of the above.                                            

     The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing 
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made 
during the preceding 24-hour period.                                            

-23-

P-->48753rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
The interest on the securities deposited in a trust, less the related 
estimated fees and expenses, will accrue daily.  The amount of net interest     
income which accrues per unit may change as securities mature or are redeemed,  
exchanged or sold, or as the expenses of a trust change or the number of        
outstanding units of a trust changes.                                           

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934.                                                           

  ACCRUED INTEREST.  Accrued interest consists of two elements.  The first
element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of     
unpaid interest on a security from the last day on which interest thereon was   
paid.  Interest on securities generally is paid monthly or semi-annually        
although a trust accrues such interest daily.  Because of this, a trust always  
has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee.  For this
reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date, 
the public offering price of units of a trust will have added to it the         
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement.              

     In an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise
have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to
the public, the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the   
first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the    
unitholder of record as of the first settlement date.  Consequently, the amount 
of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will      
include only accrued interest arising after the first settlement date to the    
date of settlement, less any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent 
to the first settlement date.                                                   

   The second element of accrued interest arises because of the structure of
the Interest Account.  The trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders  
until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust.  The trustee is    
obligated to provide its own funds, at times, in order to advanced interest     
distributions.  The trustee will recover these advancements when such interest  
is received.  Interest Account balances are established to limit the extent to  
which it may be necessary for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection
with such interest distributions.  The Interest Account balances are also       
structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances.              

Because of the varying interest payment dates of securities, accrued  
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest       
actually received by the applicable trusts and distributed to unitholders.      
Therefore, there will always remain an item of accrued interest that is added to
the value of the units.  If a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of   
his units, he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued
interest from the purchaser of his units.  Since the trustee has the use of the 
funds held in the Interest Account for distributions to unitholders and since   
such account is non-interest-bearing to unitholders, the trustee benefits       
thereby.

  COMPARISON OF PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE AND REDEMPTION PRICE.  While the net
asset value of units during the initial offering period will generally be       
determined on the basis of the current offering prices of the securities in a   
trust, after the initial offering period the net asset value of units will      
generally be determined on the basis of the current bid prices of the           
securities.  As of the close of business on the business day before the trust's 
inception date, the public offering price per unit exceeded the redemption price
at which units could have been redeemed by the amount of the sales fee.  The bid
prices for on securities similar to those in the trust are lower than the       
offering prices thereof.  For this reason, among others (including fluctuations 
in the market prices of the securities and the fact that the public offering    
price includes a sales fee), the amount realized by a unitholder upon any       
redemption of units may be less than the price paid for such units.             

     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. and through others.  Sales 
may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from the  
public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial banks 
may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The       
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in        
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional  
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not   
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In 
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the         
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the 
cost of such securities to a trust, which is based on the offering side         
evaluation of the securities.  The sponsor may also realize profits or losses   
with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from        
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or   
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or  
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such          
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of     
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said    
units at the net asset value, determined by the                                 

-25-

P-->48755th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�55th
evaluator based on the aggregate bid prices of the underlying securities in the 
trust, together with any accrued interest to the expected dates of settlement,  
provided that the repurchase price will not be reduced by any remaining creation
and development fee or organization costs during the initial offering period.   
While the sponsor may repurchase units from time to time, it does not currently 
intend to maintain an active secondary market for units.  To the extent that a  
market is maintained during the initial offering period, the prices at which    
units will be repurchased will be based upon the aggregate offering side        
evaluation of the securities in the trust.  The aggregate bid prices of the     
underlying securities in each trust are expected to be less than the related    
aggregate offering prices (which is generally the evaluation method used during 
the initial public offering period).  Accordingly, unitholders who wish to      
dispose of their units should inquire of their broker as to current market      
prices in order to determine whether there is in existence any price in excess  
of the redemption price and, if so, the amount thereof.                         

 The offering price of any units resold by the sponsor will be in accord
with that described in the currently effective prospectus describing such units.
Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such units will belong to the   
sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a secondary market, it may suspend 
or discontinue purchases of units of the trust if the supply of units exceeds   
demand, or for other business reasons.                                          

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office.    
Unitholders must sign the request exactly as their names appear on the records  
of the trustee.  If the amount of the redemption is $500 or less and the        
proceeds are payable to the unitholder(s) of record at the address of record, no
signature guarantee is necessary for redemptions by individual account owners   
(including joint owners).  Additional documentation may be requested, and a     
signature guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors,           
administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in        
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.                     

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing 
redemption requests.                                                            

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances       

-26-

P-->48756th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�56th
the trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling 
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of a trust to
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Principal Account for a trust.           

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold, 
the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust may be, reduced but   
each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately the same           
proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a time when   
securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices than might
otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be more or less  
than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of the securities 
in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                                     

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.                                            

COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units (the net
asset value) of each trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation    
time stated in the prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for  
redemption and on any other business day desired by it, by:                     

A.   adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the
trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such      
securities; (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities   
     (including "when issued" contracts, if any) held in the trust as determined
by the evaluator on the basis of bid prices therefor; and (3) interest
accrued and unpaid on the securities in the trust as of the date of   
computation;                                                          

-27-

P-->48757th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�57th
B.   deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses of the 
trust, including but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee  
     (including legal and auditing fees and any insurance costs), the evaluator,
 the sponsor and bond counsel, if any; (3) cash held for distribution to
    unitholders of record as of the business day prior to the evaluation being
  made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the trust, provided that the
     redemption price will not be reduced by any creation and development fee or
organization costs during the initial offering period; and            

C.   finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust may lower the   
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts. Fees and charges with respect  
to such plans may vary.                                                         

OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates.  Units may be purchased in denominations of one unit or any       
multiple thereof, subject to the minimum investment requirement.  Fractions of  
units, if any, will be computed to three decimal places.                        

TAXATION                                                                        

The prospectus summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax    
consequences of owning units of a trust. The discussion below supplements the   
prospectus discussion and is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus        
discussion. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with    
regard to the federal tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, or           
disposition of trust units, as well as the tax consequences arising under the   
laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. country, or other taxing jurisdiction.    

     The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. Tax laws and      
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these summaries do not      
describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker-  
dealer, ort other investor with special circumstances. In addition, this section
does not describe you state, local or foreign tax consequences. In addition, our
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to

be held by your trust. This may not be sufficient for prospective investors to  
use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                

Your trust intends (i) to elect to be treated as, and (ii) to qualify 
annually as, a regulated investment company under the Code and to comply with   
applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax 
on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders.                     

  To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends,
interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or  
other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income    
derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or  
currencies, or net income derived from interests in certain publicly traded     
partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of 
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the trust's assets is 
represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government     
securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other    
securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for  
the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value  
of the trust's total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding voting  
securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total 
assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or  
the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one issuer, or   
two or more issuers which the trust controls and are engaged in the same,       
similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain publicly  
traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment company  
taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and net  
short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses) and at least
90% of its net tax-exempt interest income each taxable year. There are certain  
exceptions for failure to qualify if the failure is for reasonable cause or is  
de minimis, and certain corrective action is taken and certain tax payments are 
made by the trust.                                                              

     As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust       
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98.2% of its capital gains in excess of its capital 
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital                                                        

-29-

P-->48759th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�59th
gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to federal income tax on long- 
term capital gains (i) will be required to include in income for federal income 
tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share of such undistributed      
amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax
paid by the trust against their federal income tax liabilities if any, and to   
claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities. A distribution 
will be treated as paid on December 31 of the current calendar year if it is    
declared by your trust in October, November or December with a record date in   
such a month and paid by your trust during January of the following calendar    
year. These distributions will be taxable to unitholders in the calendar year in
which the distributions are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the
distributions are received.                                                     

Subject to certain reasonable cause and de minimis exceptions, if your
trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed to satisfy  
the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would be taxed  
as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income were      
distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and       
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary income.                       

DISTRIBUTIONS                                                                   

 Dividends paid out of the trust's investment company taxable income are
generally taxable to a unitholder as ordinary income to the extent of the       
trust's earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional  
units.  However, certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust  
may be taxed at capital gains tax rates.  In particular, ordinary income        
dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment      
company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to   
net capital gain, provided that certain holding period requirements are         
satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends   
received by the trust itself.  Dividends received by the trust from REITs and   
foreign corporations are qualifying dividends eligible for this lower tax rate  
only in certain circumstances.  The trust will provide notice to its unitholders
of the amount of any distributions which may be taken into account as a dividend
which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates.  The trust can not make any  
guarantees as to the amount of any distribution which will be regarded as a     
qualifying dividend.                                                            

  Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income
from a trust may also be subject to a 3.8% "Medicare tax".  This tax will       
generally apply to net investment income if the taxpayer's adjusted gross income
exceeds certain threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married    
couples filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.    

A corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the   
dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the   
trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for   
distributions from regulated investment companies.  However, certain ordinary   
income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received
by the trust from certain domestic corporations may be reported by the trust as 
being eligible for the dividends received deduction.

P-->48760th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�60th
     Distributions of net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain
over net short-term capital loss), if any, properly reported as capital gain    
dividends are taxable to a unitholder as long-term capital gains, regardless of 
how long the unitholder has held trust units.  Unitholders receiving            
distributions in the form of additional units, rather than cash, generally will 
have a cost basis in each such unit equal to the value of a unit of the trust on
the reinvestment date.  A distribution of an amount in excess of the trust's    
current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated by a unitholder as 
a return of capital which is applied against and reduces the unitholder's basis 
in his or her units.  To the extent that the amount of any such distribution    
exceeds the unitholder's basis in his or her units, the excess will be treated  
by the unitholder as gain from a sale or exchange of the units.                 

 Unitholders will be notified annually as to the U.S. federal income tax
status of distributions, and unitholders receiving distributions in the form of 
additional units will receive a report as to the value of those units.          

SALE OR EXCHANGE OF TRUST UNITS                                                 

Upon the sale or other disposition of units of the trust, which a     
unitholder holds as a capital asset, such a unitholder may realize a capital    
gain or loss which will be long-term or short-term, depending upon the          
unitholder's holding period for the units.  Generally, a unitholder's gain or   
loss will be a long-term gain or loss if the units have been held for more than 
one year.                                                                       

  Any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent
that units disposed of are replaced (including through reinvestment of          
dividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30    
days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder, during    
such period, acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire,          
substantially identical stock or securities.  In such a case, the basis of the  
units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss.  Any loss       
realized by a unitholder on a disposition of trust units held by the unitholder 
for six months or less will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent
of any distributions of long-term capital gain received by the unitholder with  
respect to such units.                                                          

NATURE OF TRUST'S INVESTMENTS                                                   

Certain of the trust's investment practices are subject to special and
complex federal income tax provisions that may, among other things,             
(i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or     
deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed   
short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a 
deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited),     
(iv) cause the trust to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt
of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or
securities is deemed to occur and (vi) adversely alter the characterization of  
certain complex financial transactions.

FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS                                                   

    The trust's transactions in futures contracts and options, if any, will be
subject to special provisions of the Code that, among other things, may affect  
the character of gains and losses realized by the trust (i.e., may affect       
whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital, or short-term or long-term),   
may accelerate recognition of income to the trust and may defer trust losses.   
These rules could, therefore, affect the character, amount and timing of        
distributions to unitholders.  These provisions also (a) will require the trust 
to mark-to-market certain types of the positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat  
them as if they were closed out), and (b) may cause the trust to recognize      
income without receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts       
necessary to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement for qualifying to be taxed
as a regulated investment company and the distribution requirements for avoiding
excise taxes.                                                                   

INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CORPORATIONS                                     

  If the trust holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that     
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as 
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold 
at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income, the  
trust could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest       
charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity         
interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its          
unitholders.  The trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any 
credit or deduction for such taxes.  The trust may be able to make an election  
that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences.  In this case, the trust  
would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such PFIC       
shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not
exceed prior increases included in income. Under this election, the trust might 
be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from   
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and    
such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and   
would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax (described above).
Dividends paid by PFICs are not treated as qualified dividend income.           

BACKUP WITHHOLDING 

The trust may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax from all
taxable distributions and sale proceeds payable to unitholders who fail to      
provide the trust with their correct taxpayer identification number or to make  
required certifications, or who have been notified by the Internal Revenue      
Service that they are subject to backup withholding.  Corporate unitholders and 
certain other unitholders specified in the Code generally are exempt from such  
backup withholding.  This withholding is not an additional tax.  Any amounts    
withheld may be credited against the unitholder's U.S. federal income tax       
liability.

NON-U.S. UNITHOLDERS 

U.S. taxation of a unitholder who, as to the United States, is a      
nonresident alien individual, a foreign trust or estate, a foreign corporation  
or foreign partnership ("non-U.S. unitholder") depends on whether the income of 
the trust is "effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business carried on by
the unitholder.                                                                 

     In addition to the rules described in this section concerning the potential
imposition of withholding on distributions to non-U.S. persons, distributions   
after June 30, 2014, to non-U.S. persons that are "financial institutions" may  
be subject to a withholding tax of 30% unless an agreement is in place between  
the financial institution and the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose         
information about accounts, equity investments, or debt interests in the        
financial institution held by one or more U.S. persons or the institution is    
resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the U.S.
Treasury.  For these purpose, a "financial institution" means any entity that   
(i) accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business,   
(ii) holds financial assets for the account of others as a substantial portion  
of its business, or (iii) is engaged (or holds itself out as being engaged)     
primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities,   
partnership interests, commodities or any interest (including a futures contract
or option) in such securities, partnership interests or commodities.            
Dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after  
December 31, 2016.                                                              

Distributions to non-financial non-U.S. entities (other than publicly 
traded foreign entities, entities owned by residents of U.S. possessions,       
foreign governments, international organizations, or foreign central banks)     
after June 30, 2014, will also be subject to a withholding tax of 30% if the    
entity does not certify that the entity does not have any substantial U.S.      
owners or provide the name, address and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner.     
Dispositions of units by such persons may be subject to such withholding after  
December 31, 2016.                                                              

Income Not Effectively Connected.  If the income from the trust is not
"effectively connected" with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the non-U.S.
unitholder, distributions of investment company taxable income will generally be
subject to a U.S. tax of 30% (or lower treaty rate), which tax is generally     
withheld from such distributions.                                               

 Distributions of capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by the
trust which are properly reported by the trust as undistributed capital gains   
will not be subject to U.S. tax at the rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate) unless
the non-U.S. unitholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically     
present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and 
meets certain other requirements.  However, this 30% tax on capital gains of    
nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the United States   
for more than the 182 day period only applies in exceptional cases because any  
individual present in the United States for more than 182 days during the       
taxable year is generally treated as a resident for U.S. income tax purposes; in
that case, he or she would be subject to U.S. income tax on his or her worldwide
income at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, rather than the 30%  
U.S. tax.  In the case of a non-U.S. unitholder who is a nonresident alien      
individual, the trust may be required to withhold U.S. income tax from          
distributions of net capital gain unless the non-U.S. unitholder certifies his  
or                                                                              

-33-

P-->48763rd�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�63rd
her non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an      
exemption.  If a non-U.S. unitholder is a nonresident alien individual, any gain
such unitholder realizes upon the sale or exchange of such unitholder's units of
the trust in the United States will ordinarily be exempt from U.S. tax unless   
the gain is U.S. source income and such unitholder is physically present in the 
United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and meets certain  
other requirements.                                                             

In the case of dividends with respect to taxable years of the trust   
beginning prior to 2014, distributions from the trust that are properly reported
by the trust as an interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest   
income received by the trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend           
attributable to certain net short-term capital gain income received by the trust
may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes    
when received by certain non-U.S. investors, provided that the trust makes      
certain elections and certain other conditions are met.                         

     Income Effectively Connected.  If the income from the trust is "effectively
connected" with a U.S. trade or business carried on by a non-U.S. unitholder,   
then distributions of investment company taxable income and capital gain        
dividends, any amounts retained by the trust which are properly reported by the 
trust as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or    
exchange of units of the trust will be subject to U.S. income tax at the        
graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic             
corporations.  Non-U.S. corporate unitholders may also be subject to the branch 
profits tax imposed by the Code.  The tax consequences to a non-U.S. unitholder 
entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those
described herein.  Non-U.S. unitholders are advised to consult their own tax    
advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an          
investment in the trust.                                                        

OTHER TAXATION                                                                  

     Trust unitholders may be subject to state, local and foreign taxes on their
trust distributions.  Unitholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors 
with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the 
trust.                                                                          

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION                                                         

   INTEREST, ESTIMATED LONG-TERM RETURN AND ESTIMATED CURRENT RETURN.  As of
the close of business on the business day before the trust's inception date, the
estimated long-term return and the estimated current return, if applicable, for 
each trust were as set forth in the "Essential Information" for each trust in   
the prospectus.  Estimated current return is calculated by dividing the current 
estimated net annual interest income per unit based on the interest rates       
currently applicable to the bonds by the public offering price.  The estimated  
net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in the interest rates
applicable to the bonds (some of which may be subject to adjustments related to 
changes in the bonds' ratings as provided by certain ratings services) fees and 
expenses of the trustee, the sponsor and the evaluator and with the principal   
prepayment, redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of the securities while the  
public offering price will vary with changes in the offering price of the       
underlying securities and accrued

interest; therefore, there is no assurance that the present estimated current   
return will be realized in the future.  Estimated long-term return is calculated
using a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors  
in the relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into      
account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and        
estimated retirements or average life of all of the securities in a trust and   
(2) takes into account the expenses and sales fee associated with each trust    
unit.  Since the interest rates, market values and estimated retirements of the 
securities and the expenses of a trust may change, there is no assurance that   
the present estimated long-term return will be realized in the future.          
Estimated current return and estimated long-term return are expected to differ  
because the calculation of estimated long-term return reflects the estimated    
date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return            
calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price. 

  GENERAL.  Information contained in this Information Supplement or in the
prospectus, as it currently exists or as further updated, may also be included  
from time to time in other prospectuses or in advertising material.  Information
on the performance of a trust strategy or the actual performance of a trust may 
be included from time to time in other prospectuses or advertising material and 
may reflect sales fees and expenses of a trust.  The performance of a trust may 
also be compared to the performance of money managers as reported in SEI Fund   
Evaluation Survey or of mutual funds as reported by Lipper Analytical Services  
Inc. (which calculates total return using actual dividends on ex-dates          
accumulated for the quarter and reinvested at quarter end), Money Magazine Fund 
Watch (which rates fund performance over a specified time period after sales fee
and assuming all dividends reinvested) or Wiesenberger Investment Companies     
Service (which states fund performance annually on a total return basis) or of  
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, the American Stock Exchange Index  
(unmanaged indices of stocks traded on the New York and American Stock          
Exchanges, respectively), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (an index of 30      
widely traded industrial common stocks) or the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (an  
unmanaged diversified index of 500 stocks) or similar measurement standards     
during the same period of time.                                                 

DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES RATINGS                                               

  STANDARD & POOR'S, A DIVISION OF THE MCGRAW-HILL COMPANIES. A Standard &
Poor's issue credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an   
obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of    
financial obligations, or a specific financial program (including ratings on    
medium-term note programs and commercial paper programs). It takes into         
consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of   
credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in     
which the obligation is denominated. The issue credit rating is not a           
recommendation to purchase, sell, or hold a financial obligation, inasmuch as it
does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor.   

Issue credit ratings are based on current information furnished by the
obligors or obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers       
reliable. Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any    
credit rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited

financial information. Credit ratings may be changed, suspended, or withdrawn as
a result of changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or based on     
other circumstances.                                                            

Issue credit ratings can be either long term or short term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in the
relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an       
original maturity of no more than 365 days, including commercial paper. Short-  
term ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with  
respect to put features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual rating,  
in which the short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the    
usual long-term rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.       

Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings                                                  

Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following  
considerations:                                                                 

*  Likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its
   financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the
obligation;                                                           

*  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;                              

*  Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the  
     event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the laws of
bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.                

 The issue rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk. As
such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are   
typically rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in 
bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has    
both senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or 
operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of 
junior debt, the rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.   

AAA--An obligation rated 'AAA' has the highest rating assigned by Standard &    
Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the          
obligation is extremely strong.                                                 

AA--An obligation rated 'AA' differs from the highest-rated obligations only to 
a small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the  
obligation is very strong.                                                      

A--An obligation rated 'A' is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects  
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher- 
rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial         
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated 'BBB' exhibits adequate protection parameters. However,
adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to
a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the      
obligation.                                                                     

BB, B, CCC, CC, and C                                                           

-36-

P-->48766th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�66th
  Obligations rated 'BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC', and 'C' are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. 'BB' indicates the least degree of     
speculation and 'C' the highest. While such obligations will likely have some   
quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large        
uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.                         

BB--An obligation rated 'BB' is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other        
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the     
obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the           
obligation.                                                                     

B--An obligation rated 'B' is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations    
rated 'BB', but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial    
commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic          
conditions will likely impair the obligor's capacity or willingness to meet its 
financial commitment on the obligation.                                         

CCC--An obligation rated 'CCC' is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is    
dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the   
obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of     
adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely  
to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.        

CC--An obligation rated 'CC' is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.      

C--A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated 'C' is currently     
highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The 'C' rating may be used to cover a situation
where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken, but payments
on this obligation are being continued. A 'C' also will be assigned to a        
preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments, but that
is currently paying.                                                            

D--An obligation rated 'D' is in payment default. The 'D' rating category is    
used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the    
applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poor's believes that 
such payments will be made during such grace period. The 'D' rating also will be
used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action 
if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.                                   

Plus (+) or minus (-)--The ratings from 'AA' to 'CCC' may be modified by the    
addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the   
major rating categories.                                                        

N.R.--This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is           
insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poor's   
does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy.                    

Active Qualifiers (Currently applied and/or outstanding)                        

i--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, terms, or     
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are       
different from the credit factors, terms or both that                           

-37-

P-->48767th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�67th
determine the likelihood of receipt of principal on the obligation. The 'i'     
subscript indicates that the rating addresses the interest portion of the       
obligation only. The 'i' subscript will always be used in conjunction with the  
'p' subscript, which addresses likelihood of receipt of principal. For example, 
a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the
principal portion is rated "AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is  
not rated.                                                                      

L--Ratings qualified with 'L' apply only to amounts invested up to federal      
deposit insurance limits.                                                       

p--This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, the terms, or 
both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are      
different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood  
of receipt of interest on the obligation. The 'p' subscript indicates that the  
rating addresses the principal portion of the obligation only. The 'p' subscript
will always be used in conjunction with the 'i' subscript, which addresses      
likelihood of receipt of interest. For example, a rated obligation could be     
assigned ratings of "AAAp N.R.i" indicating that the principal portion is rated 
"AAA" and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.                  

pi--Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are based on an analysis of an issuer's       
published financial information, as well as additional information in the public
domain. They do not, however, reflect in-depth meetings with an issuer's        
management and are therefore based on less comprehensive information than       
ratings without a 'pi' subscript. Ratings with a 'pi' subscript are reviewed    
annually based on a new year's financial statements, but may be reviewed on an  
interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuer's credit       
quality.                                                                        

pr--The letters 'pr' indicate that the rating is provisional. A provisional     
rating assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt    
being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely  
or entirely dependent upon the successful, timely completion of the project.    
This rating, however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion  
of the project, makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default    
upon failure of such completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment  
with respect to such likelihood and risk.                                       

t--This symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their
contracts to full maturity or, should certain events occur, to terminate and    
cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date.               

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. Long-Term Obligation Ratings                    

  Moody's long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit
risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. 
They address the possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as 
promised. Such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial 
loss suffered in the event of default.                                          

Long-Term Rating Definitions:                                                   

Aaa--Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal
credit risk.                                                                    

-38-

P-->48768th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�68th
Aa--Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to    
very low credit risk.                                                           

A--Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low 
credit risk.                                                                    

Baa--Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are        
considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative             
characteristics.                                                                

Ba--Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject
to substantial credit risk.                                                     

B--Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit
risk.                                                                           

Caa--Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to 
very high credit risk.                                                          

Ca--Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near,
default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.              

C--Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in 
default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.            

Note: Moody's appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating    
classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation
ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates
a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of 
that generic rating category.                                                   

FITCH RATINGS LTD., International Long-Term Credit Ratings                      

A Fitch International Long-Term Credit Ratings ("LTCR") may also be   
referred to as long-term ratings. When assigned to most issuers, it is used as a
benchmark measure of probability of default and is formally described as an     
issuer default rating ("IDR"). The major exception is within public finance,    
where IDRs will not be assigned as market convention has always focused on      
timeliness and does not draw analytical distinctions between issuers and their  
underlying obligations. When applied to issues or securities, the LTCR may be   
higher or lower than the IDR to reflect relative differences in recovery        
expectations.  The following rating scale applies to foreign currency and local 
currency ratings:                                                               

Investment Grade Ratings                                                        

AAA--Highest credit quality. "AAA" ratings denote the lowest expectation of     
credit risk. They are assigned only in case of exceptionally strong capacity for
payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be        
adversely affected by foreseeable events.                                       

AA--Very high credit quality. "AA" ratings denote expectations of very low      
credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial        
commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable       
events.                                                                         

-39-

P-->48769th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�69th
A--High credit quality. "A" ratings denote expectations of low credit risk. The 
capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This        
capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to changes in circumstances or in
economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings.                        

BBB--Good credit quality. "BBB" ratings indicate that there are currently       
expectations of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial          
commitments is considered adequate but adverse changes in circumstances and     
economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity.  This is the lowest
investment grade category.                                                      

Speculative Grade                                                               

BB--Speculative. "BB" ratings indicate that there is a possibility of credit    
risk developing, particularly as the result of adverse economic change over     
time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow     
financial commitments to be met. Securities rated in this category are not      
investment grade.                                                               

B--Highly speculative.  For issuers and performing obligations, "B" ratings     
indicate that significant credit risk is present, but a limited margin of safety
remains. Financial commitments are currently being met; however, capacity for   
continued payment is contingent upon a sustained, favorable business and        
economic environment.  For individual obligations, may indicate distressed or   
defaulted obligations with potential for extremely high recoveries. Such        
obligations would possess a Recovery Rating of "RR1" (outstanding).             

CCC--For issuers and performing obligations, default is a real possibility.     
Capacity for meeting financial commitments is solely reliant upon sustained,    
favorable business or economic conditions.  For individual obligations, may     
indicate distressed or defaulted obligations with potential for average to      
superior levels of recovery. Differences in credit quality may be denoted by    
plus/minus distinctions. Such obligations typically would possess a Recovery    
Rating of "RR2" (superior), "RR3" (good) or "RR4" (average).                    

CC--For issuers and performing obligations, default of some kind appears        
probable.  For individual obligations, may indicate distressed or defaulted     
obligations with a Recovery Rating of "RR4" (average) or "RR5" (below average). 

C--For issuers and performing obligations, default is imminent.  For individual 
obligations, may indicate distressed or defaulted obligations with potential for
below-average to poor recoveries. Such obligations would possess a Recovery     
Rating of "RR6" (poor).                                                         

RD--Indicates an entity that has failed to make due payments (within the        
applicable grace period) on some but not all material financial obligations, but
continues to honor other classes of obligations. .                              

D--Indicates an entity or sovereign that has defaulted on all of its financial  
obligations. Default generally is defined as one of the following:  a)  failure 
of an obligor to make timely payment of principal and/or interest under the     
contractual terms of any financial obligation;  b) the                          

-40-

P-->48770th�Page�of�73TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�70th
bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other winding- 
up or cessation of business of an obligor; or c) the distressed or other        
coercive exchange of an obligation, where creditors were offered securities with
diminished structural or economic terms compared with the existing obligation.  
Default ratings are not assigned prospectively; within this context, non-payment
on an instrument that contains a deferral feature or grace period will not be   
considered a default until after the expiration of the deferral or grace period.

Issuers will be rated "D" upon a default.  Defaulted and distressed   
obligations typically are rated along the continuum of "C" to "B" ratings       
categories, depending upon their recovery prospects and other relevant          
characteristics. Additionally, in structured finance transactions, where        
analysis indicates that an instrument is irrevocably impaired such that it is   
not expected to meet pay interest and/or principal in full in accordance with   
the terms of the obligation's documentation during the life of the transaction, 
but where no payment default in accordance with the terms of the documentation  
is imminent, the obligation may be rated in the "B" or "CCC-C" categories.      
Default is determined by reference to the terms of the obligations'             
documentation. Fitch will assign default ratings where it has reasonably        
determined that payment has not been made on a material obligation in accordance
with the requirements of the obligation's documentation, or where it believes   
that default ratings consistent with Fitch's published definition of default are
the most appropriate ratings to assign.                                         

Note:  The modifiers "+" or "-" may be appended to a rating to denote 
relative status within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to  
the "AAA" Long-term rating category, to categories below "CCC", or to Short-term
ratings other than "F1". (The +/- modifiers are only used to denote issues      
within the CCC category, whereas issuers are only rated CCC without the use of  
modifiers.)

Ladies and Gentlemen:                                                           

We are acting as your counsel in connection with the execution and delivery by  
you of a certain Reference Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated as of 
today's date, between Advisors Asset Management, Inc., as Depositor, Evaluator  
and Supervisor (the "Depositor", "Evaluator" and "Supervisor"), and you, as     
Trustee, establishing Advisors Disciplined Trust 1243 (the "Trust"), and the    
execution by you, as Trustee under the Trust Agreement, of receipts for units   
evidencing ownership of all of the units of fractional undivided interest (such 
receipts for units and such aggregate units being herein respectively called    
"Receipts for Units" and "Units") in the Trust, as set forth in the prospectus, 
(the "Prospectus") included in the registration statement on Form S-6, as       
amended to the date hereof (the "Registration Statement"), relating to the      
Trust.  The Trust consists of the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the    
Prospectus, including delivery statements relating to contracts for the purchase
of certain securities not yet delivered and cash, cash equivalents or an        
irrevocable letter or letters of credit, or a combination thereof, in the amount
required to pay for such purchases upon the receipt of such securities (such    
securities, delivery statements and cash, cash equivalents, letter or letters of
credit being herein called the "Portfolio Assets").                             

We have examined the Trust Agreement, and originals (or copies certified or     
otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of such other instruments,            
certificates and documents as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the   
purpose of rendering this opinion.  In such examination, we have assumed the    
genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us
as originals and the conformity to the original documents of all documents      
submitted to us as copies.  As to any facts material to our opinion, we have,   
when relevant facts were not independently established, relied upon the         
aforesaid instruments, certificates and documents.                              

Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:                             

1.   The Bank of New York Mellon is a corporation organized under the laws of   
the State of New York with the powers of a trust company under the Banking Law  
of the State of New York.                                                       

2.   The Trust Agreement and the Standard Terms are in proper form for execution

Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.
