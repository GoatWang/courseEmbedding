CEO






I am white American and began my asset management career over 20 years ago.  I started as an equity research analyst in New York before earning my MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg Business School in Chicago.
In 2001, I   joined Invesco’s leadership training programme and over the subsequent 15 years served in multiple leadership roles across the company, including my previous experiences as Head of US Retail Distribution and Global ETFs.
I have also served as US chief marketing officer, head of Global Corporate Development, overseeing business strategy and mergers and acquisitions, and held leadership roles in strategy and product development in the company’s North American Institutional and Retirement divisions. 
In January 2016, I took on his new appointment and relocated to the UK with my wife and two children.
