A 1931 woodcut by Phyllis Gardner of Irish Wolfhound "Hy Niall"


Phyllis Gardner (6 October 1890 – 16 February 1939) was a writer, artist, and noted breeder of Irish Wolfhounds. Her and Rupert Brooke had, on her side at least, a passionate relationship.[1] She attended the Slade School of Fine Art and was a suffragette when they met. Their conflicting politics, and his conflicted feelings, led the relationship to end.[2]
Biography[edit]
Gardner spent some of her early childhood in Athens, where her father, Professor Ernest Arthur Gardner, was Director of the British School of Archaeology.[3] The Gardner family, which consisted of Mary, Phyllis's mother, Delphis her sister and Christopher her brother, moved according to Professor Gardner's career. They settled in Tadworth, Surrey in a large house called Farm Corner which was situated close to the Surrey Hills.
Gardner attended the progressive Saint Felix School in Southwold, Suffolk between 1907-1908. In 1908, Gardner enrolled at the Slade School of Fine Art and specialised in the craft of wood carving, but also had a fondness for drawing and painting animals. She exhibited a screen and wood carvings at the Arts and Crafts Society Eleventh Exhibition in 1916.[4][5] In later years Phyllis and Delphis carved intricate chess sets, one of which forms part of the Metropolitan Museum collection.[6]
Gardner spotted the figure of Rupert Brooke in a tea-room in King's Cross station in 1911 and Phyllis, her mother and Brooke shared a train compartment on their journey to Cambridge. During the journey, Gardner felt compelled to sketch a likeness of Brooke and upon arrival in Cambridge, Gardner was determined to discover who this young blonde haired man was, and how she could meet him.[7] Gardner's memoir about her relationship with Brooke along with their letters to one another were deposited by Delphis in the British Library in 1948 and closed to access for 50 years.[8] Due to the subjected closure period of the collection, and the secretive way Brooke referred to Gardner in his own letters the importance of their relationship was not acknowledged in preceding biographies of Brooke, in which Gardner hardly gets a mention at all. Brookes letters to Gardner depict a cruel side which his literary executor Edward Marsh tried to hide.[9] Indeed, Brooke's circle felt that Marsh's depiction of a exemplary young man cut down in his prime was a misleading portrayal of a more complex figure.[10]
After Brooke's death in 1915, Gardner devoted her time to a local hospital which treated soldiers from the front.[11] Gardner found it difficult to cope with the loss of Brooke and found the hospital a welcome distraction.[12]
In later life her family successfully bred Irish Wolfhounds and opened a kennel called Coolafin in Maidenhead.[13] Gardner wrote a well regarded history of the breed and also produced illustrations for the volume herself.

Petition ClosedPetitioning  Tennessee State House and 2 othersDecision makersTennessee State HouseFollowTennessee State SenateFollowTennessee GovernorImmediately Remove Judge Phyllis Gardner From Public OfficeNew Black Power OrganizationNew Black Power Organization38SupportersOn February 19, 2014, General Sessions Civil Court Judge Phyllis Gardner illegally detained, falsely arrested, and imprisoned Rapper/Community Activist P. Moses for no legitimate purpose. Gardner is a Civil Court judge and Tennessee statutory laws, and legislative authority does not allow a General Sessions Civil judge to imprison a person. T.C.A. 29-9-103 law only empowers Circuit, Chancery, and Criminal court judges the authority to jail persons on contempt and the process is outlined in the Rules of Proceedure.  Activist Moses was denied bail, attorney, and phone calls when placed in Shelby County Sheriff custody.      
While in Shelby County Sheriff's custody Moses was severely injured, and sustained head, neck, and significant permanent injuries. Officers forcibly removed her from the Regional Medical Center and denied her medical treatment.  
Moses was denied a Due Process hearing and bond. Gardner used outdated Writs to have Moses illegally confined against Chief Jailers objections.  Gardner then placed indefinite holds in the court and jail computer system to keep Moses hidden and falsely imprisoned.  Gardner, then took vacation where no other judge could draft an order for her to be released from jail. The commercial appeal covered a story regarding Gardner's continual absences from the bench.
It is a fact Moses is not the 1st person to be officially oppressed by this corrupt public official.  Moses appeared in court on a civil matter where Gardner arbitrarily challenged her standing in the court.  Moses had lost 50 pounds since her last driver's license was issued.  Moses produced a valid driver's licensed but Gardner stated she was impersonating herself.  The cause of action in which Moses appeared on was against Reginald Falkner and employee of Comcast, who had sexually assaulted her.
Prior to seeking civil charges and the 2-19-2014 hearing, Moses sought a criminal investigation and charges against Falkner. The prosecutor declined to prosecute because of Moses' previous public protest against the local District Attorney's Office. District Attorney Amy Wierich stated she would never prosecute a case where Moses or any of her supporters were victims.
Weirich has been highly criticized for her failure to prosecute sexual crimes against black women in Memphis. Over 12,000 rape kits were not tested under her administration. Weirich worked under Gardner for many years in the District Attorney office. Wierich and Gardner are close friends who campaigned together. Gardner is primarily known for the Georgian Hills scandal, that left many unanswered questions in Memphis surrounding little children allegedly being molested at a church day care. Gardner has since falsified documents and conspired against Moses with the local Shelby County employees and Sheriff's Officer labeling her a terrorist, Moorish and sovereign citizen on Homeland Security's Watch list. Gardner has misappropriated funds and used SCSO for her personal protection and gain.
Gardner has also sworn false statements against Moses stating she is stalking her because of the continual social media support Moses recieved from a Public Figure Facebook page disclosing the corruption of many elected officials.  It is believed Gardner obtained the illegal order of protection from a former colleague in hopes to have Moses falsely arrested again.
It is a fact that Gardner has many improprieties as a judge and former prosecutor. Many governmental agencies have ignored Moses and others pleading for help against the dishonest, unethical judge. Help remove the corruption from public office in Memphis TN.  Please show your support against arbitrary governmental abuse of power and sign this petition.This petition was delivered to:Tennessee State HouseTennessee State SenateTennessee GovernorRead the letterLetter toTennessee State HouseTennessee State SenateTennessee GovernorImmediately Remove Judge Phyllis Gardner From Public OfficeOKHuman RightsNew Black Power Organization started this petition with a single signature, and now has 38 supporters.
