IPO Preview: World Point Terminals, LP - World Point Terminals, LP (NYSE:WPT) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»IPO Preview: World Point Terminals, LPAug. 8.13 | About: World Point (WPT) IPOdesktop Value, IPOs, long onlyIPOpremiumBased in St. Louis, Mo., World Point Terminals, LP (NYSE:WPT) scheduled an $176 million IPO with a market capitalization of $660 million at a price range midpoint of $20 for Friday, Aug. 9, 2013. Nine other IPOs were scheduled for the week of Aug. 5. The full IPO calendar can be found at IPOpremium.  
S-1 filed Aug. 1, 2013 Manager, Joint Managers: BofA Merrill Co-Managers: Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Stifel, BNP PARIBAS, Stephens, Wedbush  Summary WPT is a limited partnership sponsored by secretive, privately held Apex Oil, a $5 billion in revenue company also based in St. Louis, Mo. WPT provides oil storage facilities. WPT's growth plan appears to be pretty much limited to other oil storage facilities that can be funneled in by Apex. WPT's post-IPO capacity will be 12.8 million barrels. Post-IPO, Apex will still own six refined product and crude oil storage terminals in the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions, with an aggregate available storage capacity of 7.8 million barrels. Valuation WPT has a relatively high price to book. Public shareholders receive no incentive distributions rights, which is a negative. Most limited partnerships share incentive distribution rights with public shareholders.   Valuation Ratios   Market Price / Price / Est. Yield % offered       Cap ($M) BkVlu TanBV   in IPO   World Point Terminals, LP $660 4.2 4.2 6% 27%           12 months ended             Dec '12 March '13 June'14     Est. cash available for distribution   $38.7 $39.8 $45.5     Minimum cash distribution     $39.6 $39.6 $39.6     Over     -$0.9 $0.2 $5.9     % excess of minimum     -2% 1% 15%     Glossary Conclusion Neutral on the WPT IPO, lacks growth potential.
To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited, and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above: Business WPT is a fee-based, growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership recently formed to own, operate, develop and acquire terminals and other assets relating to the storage of light refined products, heavy refined products, and crude oil. Storage terminals are strategically located in the East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Midwest regions of the United States and, as of May 31, 2013, had a combined available storage capacity of 12.4 million barrels. At the closing of this offering it will have 12.8 million barrels of available storage capacity.
 Since Jan. 1, 2013, WPT completed construction of and placed into service 0.2 million barrels of available storage capacity at existing facilities and has acquired -- or will acquire prior to the closing of this offering -- an additional 1.4 million barrels of available storage capacity, increasing storage capacity since Dec. 31, 2012, by approximately 14%. Most of the terminal facilities are strategically located on major waterways, providing easy ship or barge access for the movement of petroleum products, and have truck racks with efficient loading logistics. Several of its terminal facilities also have rail or pipeline access. For the years ended Dec. 31, 2011, and 2012, WPT generated 86% of revenue from storage services fees. For the three months ended March 31, 2012, and 2013, it generated 84% of revenue from these fees. Sponsor Generated Revenues For the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, and the three months ended March 31, 2013, revenues of 28% and 34%, respectively, were derived from Apex, the sponsor. Formed in 1932, Apex is a distribution and marketing company controlled by the controlling shareholders that supplies, distributes and markets refined petroleum products to refiners, wholesalers, distributors, marketers and industrial and commercial end users throughout the United States and international markets. For the three years ended Sept. 30, 2012, Apex averaged annual revenue in excess of $5.0 billion and sales in excess of 50 million barrels of refined products. WPT's terminals provide critical logistics services that support Apex's distribution and marketing operations. Apex also owns six refined product and crude oil storage terminals in the East Coast and Gulf Coast regions, with an aggregate available storage capacity of 7.8 million barrels. Under Contract As of May 31, 2013, 93% of available storage capacity was under contract. During the five years ended Dec. 31, 2012, more than 95% of available storage capacity was under contract. The top 10 customers (including Apex) represented over 84% of revenue for 2012, and for the first three months of 2013 have used WPT's services for an average of approximately ten years. As of May 31, 2013, 93% of available storage capacity was under contract. The top 10 customers include several major oil and natural gas companies, including Phillips 66 Company, Sunoco, and ExxonMobil.
 Sponsor One of WPT's principal attributes is its relationship with Apex, which is controlled by Paul A. Novelly and members of his family. 28% of WPT's revenue for 2012 was derived from Apex. Aprex is a secretive private company based in St. Louis, Mo. At the closing of this offering, the controlling shareholders will indirectly control the general partner, and the sponsors will own all incentive distribution rights.

Incentive Distribution Rights
None to public shareholders (this is a negative). Minimum Distribution WPT expects to make a minimum distribution of $1.20 per year, which is 6% at the price range midpoint of $20. Use of Proceeds WPT expects to receive $70 million from its IPO from the sale of 3.9 million shares. Shareholders expect to sell 4.9 million shares, or 56% of the IPO: 
pay transaction expenses related to the new revolving credit facility in the amount of $1.6 million;
distribute to the selling unitholder $29.9 million, the majority of which is to reimburse the selling unitholder for costs related to the acquisition or improvement of assets that the selling unitholder will contribute to WPT;
repay indebtedness owed to a commercial bank under a term loan of $8.1 million;
repay indebtedness owed to a related party of $14.1 million;
repay existing payables of $4.3 million; and
provide working capital of $12.0 million.

World Point Terminals, LP Announces Financial Results For The Quarter Ended March 31, 2017






Business Wire




May 9, 2017 4:05 PM EDT













 


















































  World Point Terminals, LP (the "Partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership (NYSE: WPT), announced today its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Financial Summary  A summary of the financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, includes:   Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $0.6 million, or 2% compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.     Base storage services fees increased $1.0 million, or 5%, primarily as a result of the addition of new customer contracts at the Blakeley Island, Chickasaw, Chesapeake and North Little Rock terminals, partially offset by a reduction in contracted storage volume at the Baton Rouge terminal and the cancellation of month-to-month storage agreements at the Galveston terminal.   Excess storage services fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $0.1 million, or 46%, primarily as a result of increased terminaling activity at the Jacksonville terminal, partially offset by reduced terminaling activity at the Granite City and North Little Rock terminals.   Ancillary and additive services decreased $0.6 million, or 13%, primarily as a result of (i) decreased volumes throughput at many of our terminals, resulting in decreased additive injection, blending and product handling revenues, (ii) decreased heating activity at the Baton Rouge, St. Louis, Chesapeake, Pine Bluff and Galveston terminals, and (iii) reduced polymer processing activity at the Granite City terminal, offset by increased heating activity at the Chickasaw terminal and increased additive and blending revenues at the Jacksonville terminal.     Operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $0.9 million, or 12%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to a (i) $0.7 million increase in repairs and maintenance including dredging costs of $0.5 million incurred at the Newark terminal, (ii) $0.2 million increase in labor costs, and (iii) $0.1 million increase in utilities, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in insurance.   Selling, general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to affiliates, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased $0.1 million, or 9%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily related to a decrease in equity based compensation due to restricted units becoming fully vested.   Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $0.1 million, or 2%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to a (i) $0.3 million increase due to 2016 construction at the Mobile terminals, including $0.1 million related to two newly constructed tanks at the Blakeley Island terminal, and (ii) $0.2 million increase related to two newly constructed tanks at the North Little Rock terminal, offset by $0.4 million decrease due to assets that became fully depreciated at the Baton Rouge, Granite City and Galveston terminals in the first quarter of 2017.   Interest expense consists primarily of commitment fees paid to maintain the Credit Facility and amortization of associated costs over the term of the facility. Interest expense remained unchanged at $0.2 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.   Interest and dividend income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased slightly compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was attributable to additional short-term investment positions held during the first quarter of 2017.   Gain on investments for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $0.2 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in the mark-to-market gain on investments.   Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased slightly compared with the three months ended March 31, 2016.   Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased $0.1 million, or 1%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Net income was $0.27 per unit for the three months ended March 31, 2017.   Average daily terminal throughput for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased 7 mbbls, or 5%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily as a result of increased throughput at the Jacksonville, Weirton and Mobile terminals, partially offset by decreased throughput at the Glenmont and Newark terminals.   Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Partnership, decreased $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2016.    Attachment A to this communication contains selected financial and operational data from the Partnership's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

About World Point

 

World Point Terminals, LP
World Point Terminals, LP is a fee-based, growth-oriented limited partnership formed to own, operate, develop and acquire terminal assets relating to the storage of light refined products, heavy refined products and crude oil.
Our storage facilities are strategically located in the East Coast, Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States.  Refiners typically use our terminals because they prefer to subcontract terminaling and storage services or their facilities do not have adequate storage capacity or dock infrastructure or do not meet specialized handling requirements for a particular product.    We also provide storage services to distributors, marketers and traders that require access to large, strategically located storage capacity with efficient access to transportation infrastructure and in close proximity to refineries, demand markets or export hubs.
Our combination of geographic location, efficient and well-maintained storage assets and access to multiple modes of transportation gives us the flexibility to meet the evolving demands of our existing customers, as well as the demands of prospective customers.
Our primary business objective are to generate stable cash flows to enable us to pay quarterly cash distributions to our unit holders and to increase our quarterly distributions over time.  We intend to achieve these objectives by anticipating long-term infrastructure needs in the areas we serve and by growing our storage terminal network through acquisitions of complementary assets from our sponsors, expansion of our existing facilities, the construction of new terminals in existing or new markets and strategic acquisitions from third parties.
World Point’s assets and subsidiaries include:


Center Point Terminal Company, LLC
Center Point Terminal Baltimore, LLC
