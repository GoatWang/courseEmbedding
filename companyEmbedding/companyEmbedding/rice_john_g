                The Top 4 General Electric Shareholders (GE)            


    By John Burke | Updated July 21, 2017 — 8:18 AM EDT    






Share





















































General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) was in thirteenth place on the Fortune 500 list for 2017. General Electric had a market capitalization of over $237 billion (as of July 5, 2017), and is one of America’s most familiar brands. The company produces products ranging from toasters and clock radios to the GEnx jet engine for the Boeing 787.
On June 12, 2017, the company announced that its CEO, chairman, and largest shareholder — Jeffrey R. Immelt — will retire in August. The current CEO of GE Healthcare — John Flannery — is set to take over on August 1, 2017. In early June GE completed its buyout of Baker Hughes — its own oil field service provider — which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BHGE. The new company will be the world's second-largest of its kind by revenue.
1. Jeffrey R. Immelt
Jeffrey R. Immelt is the chairman of the board and CEO of General Electric. He joined GE in 1982 to work in corporate marketing. Under Immelt’s leadership, the company pushed back against Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy and the state legislature in response to a proposal to increase business taxes. As of May, 2017, Immelt held close to 2.6 million shares of GE. On June 12, 2017, GE announced Immelt's retirement later this year.
2. John G. Rice
John G. Rice is vice chairman of General Electric, leading the company’s global operations based in Hong Kong. He began his career at GE in 1978. Since that time, Rice worked in Singapore and Canada, before moving to Hong Kong. As of November, 2016, Rice held over 541,000 shares of GE. 
3. David L. Joyce
David L. Joyce is a vice chair and CEO of GE Aviation, a role he has had since June, 2008. Joyce is another GE veteran, he started his career in GE in 1980 when he joined as a product engineer. As of February, 2017, he held over 478,000 shares of GE, which makes him the third largest individual shareholder.
4. Daniel Heintzelman
​Daniel Heintzelman served as the vice chairman of Enterprise & Risk Operations at GE from 2011 to 2013. He's currently a senior advisor for Blackstone Group, where he provides counsel on the aerospace and industrials sectors, according to Bloomberg. Heintzelman is the fourth largest individual shareholder with almost 373,000 shares.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. John G Rice Atty At Law PLC1795 Ecton RdWinchester, KY 40391(859) 737-5316AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Irvin Jr, John G301 E Main St Ste 800Lexington, KY 40507(859) 296-2300AttorneysTax AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. John H Keeton Attorney7 Cleveland AveWinchester, KY 40391(859) 737-9955AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Hendricks, John M.212 S Maple StWinchester, KY 40391(859) 744-3251Family Law AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Rompf, John H Jr125 S Main StWinchester, KY 40391(859) 744-2551AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Hendricks, John M51 S Main StWinchester, KY 40391(859) 744-6828AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. John S Pumphrey Atty51 S Main StWinchester, KY 40391(859) 744-6828AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Wheatley John R Atty100 Hubbard RdWinchester, KY 40391(859) 744-8951AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. John R Wheatley Atty608 Gilbert CtWinchester, KY 40391(859) 745-1483AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection10. John Attorney Hafner At Law253 S LimestoneLexington, KY 40508(859) 252-0083AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection11. John Simms Attorney1608 Harrodsburg RdLexington, KY 40504(859) 225-5275AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection12. John Sword3553 Colonel RdRichmond, KY 40475(859) 353-8899AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection13. John D Meyers Jr Psc(1)277 E High St Ste 100Lexington, KY 40507(859) 381-1316AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysWebsiteServicesI called this Attorney and he answered the phone and he took my number and never called me back.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Europeans: A Geography Of People, Culture, And Environmentby Ostergren, Robert Clifford/ Rice, John G.Offering a comprehensive introduction to European geography, this timely text is as authoritative as it is richly nuanced and engaging. The authors analyze the ongoing process of integration that is giving new meaning to the idea of being European, while also delineating the important subregional differences that exist among the continent's people and places. Coverage encompasses the entire region: its physical setting and environment; population and migration; work and leisure; language and religion; and political organization. Particular attention is given to the historic evolution and contemporary features of the urban environments in which the majority of Europeans live their daily lives. Combining vivid description, essential information, and cogent analysis, the text is illustrated with 200 photographs and over 45 maps.Geography, Human GeographyCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
