The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Symetra is a United States-based family of companies providing retirement plans, employee benefits, annuities and life insurance through independent distributors nationwide. The main headquarters of the company is located in Bellevue, Washington. Started in 1957, Symetra Financial began as a subsidiary of Safeco. In 1967, the total amount of insurance in force for Symetra surpassed the $1 billion mark. By 1995, the total assets had grown to $10 billion. In 2004, Safeco sold its life insurance business to an investor group led by White Mountains Insurance Group and Berkshire Hathaway.[1]
Symetra Financial was eventually acquired by Japanese insurer Sumitomo Life for $3.8billion. The Japanese insurer was looking to expand its foothold on insurance especially with an aging Japanese market.[2]

Symetra began as the investment unit for Safeco. Its life insurance branch was established in 1957 and headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, with additional products being added in ensuing years. It broke away in 2010 and now has $30 billion in assets as a publicly traded stock company.
The company offers employee benefits and individual life insurance policies as well as some retirement planning products. Its products are brokered through individual distributors, altogether servicing about 1.7 million people through its multiple branches.
Most states are serviced through its primary companies, with New York products being handled under its subsidiary First Symetra National Life Insurance Company of New York.




Insurance Products
Life Insurance
Symetra offers both term and permanent life insurance products for individuals. Term life insurance is sold in 10, 15, 20 or 30 year terms with level premiums throughout that period. In other words, you pay the same amount each month for the entire term. If you pass away at any point during that term, the full value of the policy will be distributed to your beneficiaries.
Symetra offers the ability for insureds to receive up to 75% of their policy’s value up-front if diagnosed with a terminal illness. Additionally, policyholders can convert a term policy to universal life at any period before the term ends as long as it’s before the policyholder’s 75th birthday.
Several permanent life insurance policies are available, depending on your needs. The classic universal life policy has a guaranteed death benefit as long as regular premium payments are made. These policies have a cash value that can be borrowed against, but loans must be fully repaid for the full value of the policy to be distributed as a death benefit.
The “Symetra Sul-G Survivorship” plan is similar to regular universal life, but it’s engineered specifically to act as an estate planning tool, with optional riders for charitable giving and estate preservation for added flexibility in planning.
“Symetra Successor Single Premium” is exactly that, a plan with a single premium. You deposit a significant amount of money into the plan once, allowing you to hold it in a tax-free environment to streamline estate planning.
Employee Benefits
Symetra offers a variety of group plans for employers, including life, disability, critical illness, and stop-loss plans. These plans are available in groups with a minimum of 50 people.
Life is available in a basic and supplemental version. Basic life insurance offers a single set of benefits with costs divided among the employer and employees. Supplemental allows individual employees to customize their plans, paying for the difference in premiums out of pocket.
Disability benefits are offered in a cafeteria plan, with employees able to pick and choose among the coverages they want. Payments for both short and long-term disability are available.
Symetra’s stop loss program is one of its more unique products, and it pioneered the product in 1976 before any other companies were offering it. Essentially, stop-loss polices act as supplements to other insurance plans, covering losses that are catastrophic in nature.
Additional Products
Aside from insurance, Symetra sells financial products for retirement planning, including annuities and retirement plans. Several types of annuities are offered, including deferred, indexed, and indexed, to offer better flexibility in planning.
Symetra Rates
According to our rate quote test, a 30 year old male living in California can receive $1 million in term life insurance coverage for $475 a year. That breaks down to a little more than $40 a month, and is almost 13% below the average compared to other companies we have tested.
Claims
Symetra does not offer an online claims reporting option. Instead, the company’s website directs you to call customer service at 800-796-3872 between 9am and 7:30pm Eastern Time.
If filing a claim for an employee benefits plan, you will want to contact your employer first for instructions. These claims are usually handled by HR.
For individual claims, you will want to call the customer service number listed above and verify what paperwork will need to be provided. In general, life insurance claims will require a death certificate for the insured and identifying information for the beneficiary filing the claim. Additional information may be required depending on the situation.
Consumer Research and Complaints
Although Symetra Life Insurance Company is not Better Business Bureau accredited, it does however have an “A+” rating. The site lists only two complaints against the company in the last three years, one of which has been closed in the last 12 months. Both complaints were in regards to product and service.

I purchased supplemental spousal term life through my employer.  I was upfront and honest about my wife’s cancer (she was in remission at the time).  She died in December after having a year’s worth of consistently paid premiums.  I insured her for 40K.  Will my claim be denied?

Hi Kenneth,
I am sorry to hear about your wife. 
Your best bet would be to contact your insurance company directly. It would probably be beneficial to get any documents, including correspondences where you may have disclosed your wife’s health status, just in case they deny the claim. If your paperwork appears to back your position, you may want to contact a lawyer if your claim is denied.
Best,
Eric Stauffer

Symetra Life Insurance

The Symetra Life Insurance Company has a 50-year history.  The company as it is known today was formed in 2004, when the life insurance  and investments subsidiaries of a Seattle-based Fortune 500 insurance company  were purchased by an investor group led by White Mountains Insurance Group,  Ltd., and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Together, these companies became the  privately held corporation now known as Symetra Financial.
The Current President and CEO is Randall H. Talbot,
The Company is headquartered in Bellevue, WA
Last year (2008) the company reported total assets of $19.9  billion
According To the Company

Symetra Life Insurance Company prides itself on delivering  additional benefits beyond simple life insurance coverage to both individual  and Group Life Insurance policyholders. Such Value Added Services include:

Living       Benefits – The Company wants policy holders to have access to       benefits they can use right now, such as financial and legal counseling.
End       of Life Benefits – Symetra Life Insurance understands that end of       life issues are stressful. Policyholders and their caregivers/survivors       are offered help to manage end of life issues including Accelerated Life       Benefit options, and medical case management
Beneficiary       Benefits – All Symetra Life Insurance beneficiaries are offered       family support such as bereavement counseling and legal advice

These  added benefits are all part Symetra’s approach to life insurance which is a  philosophy based upon helping to manage benefit costs while adding value for  members. The company offers Term Life insurance, and Permanent Life insurance  products such as Whole Life, Universal and Variable Life. Symetra Life  Insurance also offers a unique life insurance product to businesses called Worksite. Worksite is a workplace  program that gives employees the option of purchasing life insurance through  the convenience of payroll deductions, and, because the policies are  individually owned, coverage stays with the employee if they leave their job.

Life Insurance In A Nutshell





WHAT IS LIFE INSURANCE?
In its basic form a life insurance policy is a contract between the policyowner and the insurance company which states that in exchange for timely payment of premiums, the company will pay a death benefit when the insured person dies. Benefits will be paid to the beneficiary(ies) named by the policyowner.
WHAT TYPE OF LIFE INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE?
There may seem to be a bewildering number of life insurance product choices out there, but there are four primary types of coverage available. They include:
Group Life Insurance: Offered Through Employers
If life insurance coverage is available through your employer, it is a good first step toward protecting your family; however, you may find the need to supplement it with individual coverage. 




Group Life Advantages
DisadvAntages


Relatively Cost Effective.
Maximum face amounts typically apply and may fall short of actual coverage needs


Medical tests and underwriting may not be required.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
