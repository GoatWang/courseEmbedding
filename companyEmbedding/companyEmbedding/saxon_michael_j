This is the home page for the Open Source SAXON XSLT processor developed by 
    Saxonica Limited. It also provides information about commercial versions of the Saxon product
    available from Saxonica.
See also the project page for Saxon.
Documentation for the current release of Saxon is available online at http://www.saxonica.com/documentation.
The latest version of Saxon is version 9.8, first released on 8 June 2017 (the same day as the XSLT 3.0 Recommendation).
The most stable version is version 9.7, first released on 27 November 2015, and regularly updated with maintenance releases.
There are several editions of Saxon currently maintained:

Saxon-HE (home edition) is an open source product available under the Mozilla Public License version 2.0.
    It provides implementations of XSLT (3.0), XQuery (3.1), and XPath (2.0 and 3.1) at the basic level of conformance
defined by W3C. It is available for Java and .NET.
Saxon-PE (professional edition) is a commercial product available at modest prices from
         Saxonica Limited. It adds a number of features to Saxon-HE,
         including support for Saxon extensions and extensibility mechanisms, support for optional features defined
         in XSLT 3.0 and XQuery 3.1 including higher-order functions, integration with the ICU-J library to provide localization for different languages,
         and support for external object models such as JDOM2, XOM, DOM4J, and AXIOM. 
         It is available for Java and .NET.
Saxon-EE (enterprise edition) is the fully-featured commercial product.
        Saxon-EE 9.8 offers a complete implementation of the XSLT 3.0 Recommendation published on 8 June 2017.
        As well as a fully conformant XSD 1.0 and XSD 1.1 schema processor, and support for schema-aware XSLT and XQuery 
        processing, it offers many other features including streaming in XSLT and XQuery, support for XQuery
        updates, an advanced query optimizer, compilation of XQuery and XSLT code to Java bytecode, multi-threaded execution,
        and much more.
        For full details, see the Saxonica web site. 
        It is available for Java and .NET.
Saxon-JS (JavaScript edition) provides XSLT 3.0 running in the browser. Stylesheets
        are compiled into Stylesheet Export Files using Saxon-EE, and can then be executed in the browser. It runs in all modern 
        browsers with Javascript enabled.
Saxon/C is currently at version 1.0: it offers the same core functionality as the Saxon-HE product,
    but cross-compiled into a native executable library (.dll on Windows, .so on Linux) with a C-compatible API, plus a PHP
    extension enabling it to be invoked from PHP applications. 
    Details can be found on the project page.

Saxon 9.8 on Java requires Java 6 (also known as JDK 1.6) or later. It is not supported on Java 5 (JDK 1.5).
Saxon 9.8 on .NET requires .NET framework 3.5 or later. Users have reported that it also works on Mono, but we do
not run tests on this platform.

A comparison of the features available in different editions 
    of the Saxon product is available.
A detailed history of changes in successive releases
is available.

Current releases
Saxon-EE 9.8
The commercial Enterprise Edition from Saxonica, supporting XSLT 3.0, XPath 2.0 and 3.1,
 XQuery 3.1, XML Schema 1.0 and 1.1, and
 XQuery Update 1.0.
 

All current releases are listed on the Saxonica download page.
Source code for Saxon-EE is not available (except to Saxonica development partners).
Saxon-PE 9.8
The commercial Professional Edition from Saxonica, supporting XSLT 3.0, XPath 2.0 and 3.1,
 and XQuery 3.1. It omits support for some
 optional features of these specifications, notably schema awareness and (in the case of XSLT 3.0) streaming.

All current releases are listed on the Saxonica download page.
Source code for Saxon-PE is not available (except to Saxonica development partners).
Saxon-HE 9.8
The open-source implementation of XSLT 3.0, XPath 2.0 and 3.1,
 and XQuery 3.1. This provides the "basic" conformance level of these languages; it also
supports some optional features of the specifications such as serialization and support for XQuery modules.
Not included in the Home Edition are: schema processing and schema aware XSLT and XQuery; 
    support for higher-order functions; support for XPath 1.0 (and XSLT 1.0) backwards compatibility mode, 
    numerous Saxon extensions; calling out to 
Java methods; XQuery Update support; various optimizations including join optimization, streamed processing,
multi-threaded execution, and byte code generation.

There are four files available:
a ZIP file containing executable code for the Java platform; a .EXE installer for the
.NET platform; a resources file containing documentation and sample applications applicable
to both platforms; and a ZIP archive of the source code for both platforms.
 (Documentation is also available online)
Download for Java (4.9 Mbytes)
Download for .NET (5.8 Mbytes)
Download documentation and samples) (31.1 Mbytes) (available shortly)
Source code for Saxon-HE (3.8 Mbytes)
Recent Saxon-HE releases can also be downloaded from Maven: 
see Maven Repository.
At the time of writing, Saxon 9.7 is more stable and mature than Saxon 9.8, so users who do not require
the new features of 9.7 may prefer to stick with 9.7 for a few months longer. The current maintenance
release on the 9.7 branch is 9.7.0.18.
Since Saxon 9.4, the Subversion repository for source code is no longer maintained in SourceForge, but
    on the Saxonica site at https://dev.saxonica.com/repos/archive/opensource.
    The repository does not contain the development branch of the code, only versions that have been released; it
    is the best way of obtaining bug fixes quickly if you are prepared to build the product from source (which is not for the faint-hearted).


Note that bug fixes are typically made available in Subversion as soon as they are available, and are then consolidated
    periodically into a maintenance release. Source code under development is not held in Subversion, and is not available
    until a tested release is issued. Sometimes prereleases of new facility releases are made available for testing; these
are announced on the saxon-help mailing list but will not generally be advertised here.
Older releases of Saxon-HE remain available from SourceForge: see the 
    SourceForge download page for details. If you require a release that
is no longer listed, please ask: we can't offer to support it, but in general we don't mind you using it at your own risk.
Saxon-JS 1.0
Saxon-JS is the Javascript edition of Saxon, offering XSLT 3.0 running in the browser. It supersedes the earlier
    Saxon-CE product. For information
about the product, see the Saxon-JS home page. 
Bugs, Forums and Discussion Lists
The bug tracker for all versions of Saxon is a Redmine database hosted
at saxonica.plan.io. You are free to enter new bugs here directly,
or if bugs are raised by other routes (such as the mailing list) we will register them there if they need
to be tracked.
The Redmine database also offers discussion forums and these are the best way to raise technical issues
or questions that need an answer from the Saxonica development team.
The SourceForge project hosts a mailing list, saxon-help, which provides a good way of reaching other
Saxon users. Since SourceForge is dedicated to open source, we don't encourage use of this list for issues
specific to the commercial versions of the product.
If you need help using the underlying languages (XSLT, XQuery, XSD etc) and the problem is not specific
to Saxon, it's better to use a general forum rather than a Saxon community resource. The
StackOverflow site is the best place to get a 
good answer to straight coding questions, while the xsl-list
(also known as the Mulberry list) is the place for deeper discussions about the nature of XSLT as a language.
To search the history of previous questions and answers on these lists, the database maintained 
at MarkMail is the most comprehensive and most readily searchable.
Please try to avoid contacting Saxonica developers by personal email; while we love to help, it's much easier
to manage the correspondence through an archived forum.
Older Products
Saxon-B
Saxon-HE does not offer all the capabilities that were present in Saxon-B. Most notably, support for Saxon
        extension functions and other extensions was dropped, as was the capability for writing extension functions
        that rely on dynamic loading of Java or .NET code (a new facility for "integrated extension functions" is
        however available). Users whose code relies on these features of Saxon-B should either purchase the Professional Edition product
        or stick with Saxon-B: the latest release of Saxon-B is 9.1.0.8, and although there are no plans to develop
        it further or maintain it, it will remain available indefinitely.
Saxon-B version 9.1.0.8 is a complete
and conformant implementation of the XSLT 2.0, XQuery 1.0, and XPath 2.0 
Recommendations published on 23 January 2007 by W3C.
Saxon-B 9.1.0.8 is available
on both the Java and .NET platforms.
For the bug fixes
in each successive maintenance release, see the Release Notes and Change Notes for the release
on the SourceForge downloads page.
It can be downloaded from:

Download for Java (1.9 Mbytes)
Download for .NET (13.7 Mbytes)
Download source code for 9.1.0.7 (2.9 Mbytes)
Download documentation and samples (11.9 Mbytes).
     (Note, this file was first issued with Saxon-B 9.1.0.1 and the URL reflects this. The source code present in this file is the source of 9.1.0.1)

Saxon 6.5.5
The Saxon XSLT 1.0 processor remains available. The latest version is 6.5.5.
        However, even if your stylesheets only require XSLT 1.0, it is probably better to run them under Saxon 9.x
This product is mature and stable, and further developments are very unlikely.
The download includes documentation, source
code, Java executables, and sample code.
Known limitations of this release are listed here. This page
will be updated with information about any new bugs that come to light.

Saxon 6.5.3
The previous release of Saxon's implementation of XSLT 1.0. This product remains available because
it runs in some environments that are not supported by Saxon 6.5.5, notably under JDK 1.1.
The download includes documentation, source
code, Java executables, and sample code.
Known limitations of this release are listed here.
No further updates will be made to this page.

Instant Saxon 6.5.3
The most recent version of the Instant Saxon product. Instant Saxon was built using
the same source code as Saxon 6.5.3, but was packaged for ease of installation when using
the Microsoft Java VM. Since the Microsoft Java VM has long ceased to be a standard component of the
Windows platform, this release has outlived its usefulness, but it remains available
for download for those of an antiquarian disposition.

Old products
Ant Task for Saxon
There is a custom Ant task for invoking Saxon XSLT transformations. This was previously issued as part
    of the Saxon product but has now been separated into a separate package under the Saxon SourceForge project.
    It is no longer actively developed and is not recommended (there are a number of bugs, and it is difficult
    to improve the quality because of an absence of test material). The download is
here.
Ælfred
The Ælfred XML Parser that was bundled with Saxon versions
up to version 7.1 is available as a separate download. It is of historic interest only.
DTDGenerator
Also available on this site is the DTDGenerator program. This was formerly
produced as a Saxon demonstration application, but has since been adapted to work as a pure
SAX application, with no dependencies on the Saxon software.
Documentation for earlier releases remains present on the SourceForge web site:
6.4.2, 
6.4.3,
6.5,
6.5.1,
6.5.2,
6.5.3,
6.5.4,
6.5.5,

7.4,
7.5,
7.5.1,
7.6,
7.7,
7.8,
7.9,
7.9.1
For releases from 8.0 onwards, the documentation is not available directly
on the web site, but can be obtained by downloading the software.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Saxon, Michael J carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Saxon, Michael J currently holds license 9512, 36276 (Hvac A/C Technician (Registered)), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Saxon, Michael J



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Saxon, Michael J



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Saxon, Michael J



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
