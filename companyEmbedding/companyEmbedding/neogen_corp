Food Safety Solutions









Neogen® offers food safety products, services and expertise to help ensure the safety and quality of food, nutraceuticals, and nutritional supplements. Neogen’s food safety on-site tests are rapid, accurate and easy to use. For companies that prefer not to do their own on-site testing, Neogen also offers a rapid laboratory testing service at its locations in Lansing, Mich., and Ayr, Scotland.
Neogen’s comprehensive line of rapid food safety products includes:
Sanitation Verification  Neogen’s AccuPoint® Advanced ATP system’s new innovations allow for better functionality and service than ever before. These innovations include the new Advanced samplers, which feature a chemiluminescent reaction in a liquid-stable solution. In addition, AccuPoint Advanced has been approved by the AOAC Research Institute as part of their Performance Tested MethodsSM (PTM) program. As the first sanitation verification system to receive such an approval, Neogen has set the industry standard for sanitation verification devices.
Indicator/spoilage organism tests The company’s Soleris® and BioLumix® rapid microbiology systems provide reliable results faster – impacting operations by moving products and people faster. While waiting on microbiological results has been the standard, Soleris and BioLumix take the same reliable media-based methods, and makes them considerably faster — saving hours and days.
Mycotoxin tests  Neogen's Reveal® Q+ MAX tests feature a common water based extraction that enables users to test for 6 mycotoxins from the same prepared sample. The Reveal Q+ tests are fully quantitative later flow tests offering a simple and accurate results in only minutes. Agri-Screen® and Veratox® mycotoxin test kits provide screening and quantitative ELISA-based tests for aflatoxin, DON, fumonisin, zearalenone, ochratoxin and T-2/HT-2 toxin. Neogen’s line of rapid mycotoxin tests has more official approvals than any other company.
Food allergen tests   Neogen offers screening and quantitative food allergen test kits to detect tree nuts, almond, egg, gliadin/gluten, hazelnut, lupine, casein, total milk, mustard, peanut, sesame, crustacea, soy, and walnut residues. Neogen’s food allergen tests can detect the target allergen in ingredients, liquids, clean-in-place rinses, finished foods, and on environmental surfaces. Neogen Reveal 3-D food allergen kits are easy-to-use and interpret strip tests that screen samples for the detection of trace levels of specific food allergens in 10 minutes or less. Neogen’s Veratox® for food allergen kits are quantitative tests that compare up to 19 samples at a time against 5 test controls.
Pathogen tests  Neogen’s ANSR® test system is the quickest and easiest testing method to definitively detect Salmonella, Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, or E. coli O157:H7 DNA in food and environmental samples — providing results in as little as 10 minutes. Reveal’s lateral flow device combines an immunoassay with chromatography for a rapid and accurate one-step result.
Dehydrated culture media  Neogen’s Acumedia® subsidiary has been recognized since 1978 as a premier manufacturer of high-quality dehydrated culture media for industrial, pharmaceutical, biotech, food safety and life science applications.

Animal Safety Solutions








Neogen’s Animal Safety Division manufactures and markets rodenticides and pharmaceuticals, vaccines, topicals, disinfectants, and diagnostic products to the professional animal care market.
Veterinary performance and companion animal products
Neogen’s animal safety efforts extend to both sides of the farm gate with safety solutions for performance and companion animals. The company manufactures and markets pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and diagnostic products. The company’s extensive line of equine health products features EqStim®, a proven, safe immunostimulant, which boosts the immune response of horses to help combat respiratory ailments, and BotVax® B, which has protected thousands of horses against Clostridium botulinum type B. The company’s comprehensive line of companion animal health products includes PanaKare™, which reverses the debilitating effects of pancreatic insufficiency, and RenaKare™, our potassium supplement that helps pets conquer the daily challenges of renal disease.
Veterinary instruments and suppliesNeogen’s Ideal® Instruments subsidiary, founded in 1931, maintains a leadership role in the development of precision veterinary drug delivery instruments to help minimize drug residues that might otherwise find their way into meat and milk supplies. The company’s line of patented detectable needles greatly lessen the chance that a broken needle would ever arrive on a dinner plate. Neogen also offers its veterinary products through a continuing program of instituting exclusive supply agreements with major farm and ranch retailers.
InsecticidesThe company’s Chem-Tech, Ltd.™ products are highly effective insecticides that utilize environmentally friendly technical formulas, several of which are approved for use in food establishments. Chem-Tech’s Prozap® insecticide brand is well known in the large animal production industry, and is particularly popular with dairy and equine producers. 
Disinfectants and cleaning productsNeogen is dedicated to providing a comprehensive line of preventative animal health disinfectant and cleaner products to animal producers and veterinary clinics. Stopping a bacterial, viral, or fungal outbreak before it can start is a critical goal in food and animal safety.
RodenticidesNeogen’s broad-based food and animal safety mission was built with the understanding that otherwise wholesome food and feed face numerous safety challenges every step of its way to the consumer. Rats and mice remain a serious threat to food and feedstuffs, and spread disease. Neogen’s proven line of rodenticides is used for effective control of rodent infestations and is often a critical component of an overall biosecurity plan.

Neogen® offers food safety products, services and expertise to help ensure the safety and quality of food, nutraceuticals, and nutritional supplements. Neogen’s food safety on-site tests are rapid, accurate and easy to use. For companies that prefer not to do their own on-site testing, Neogen also offers a rapid laboratory testing service at its locations in Lansing, Mich., and Ayr, Scotland.
Neogen’s comprehensive line of rapid food safety products includes:
Sanitation Verification  Neogen’s AccuPoint® Advanced ATP system’s new innovations allow for better functionality and service than ever before. These innovations include the new Advanced samplers, which feature a chemiluminescent reaction in a liquid-stable solution. In addition, AccuPoint Advanced has been approved by the AOAC Research Institute as part of their Performance Tested MethodsSM (PTM) program. As the first sanitation verification system to receive such an approval, Neogen has set the industry standard for sanitation verification devices.
Indicator/spoilage organism tests The company’s Soleris® and BioLumix® rapid microbiology systems provide reliable results faster – impacting operations by moving products and people faster. While waiting on microbiological results has been the standard, Soleris and BioLumix take the same reliable media-based methods, and makes them considerably faster — saving hours and days.
Mycotoxin tests  Neogen's Reveal® Q+ MAX tests feature a common water based extraction that enables users to test for 6 mycotoxins from the same prepared sample. The Reveal Q+ tests are fully quantitative later flow tests offering a simple and accurate results in only minutes. Agri-Screen® and Veratox® mycotoxin test kits provide screening and quantitative ELISA-based tests for aflatoxin, DON, fumonisin, zearalenone, ochratoxin and T-2/HT-2 toxin. Neogen’s line of rapid mycotoxin tests has more official approvals than any other company.
Food allergen tests   Neogen offers screening and quantitative food allergen test kits to detect tree nuts, almond, egg, gliadin/gluten, hazelnut, lupine, casein, total milk, mustard, peanut, sesame, crustacea, soy, and walnut residues. Neogen’s food allergen tests can detect the target allergen in ingredients, liquids, clean-in-place rinses, finished foods, and on environmental surfaces. Neogen Reveal 3-D food allergen kits are easy-to-use and interpret strip tests that screen samples for the detection of trace levels of specific food allergens in 10 minutes or less. Neogen’s Veratox® for food allergen kits are quantitative tests that compare up to 19 samples at a time against 5 test controls.
Pathogen tests  Neogen’s ANSR® test system is the quickest and easiest testing method to definitively detect Salmonella, Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, or E. coli O157:H7 DNA in food and environmental samples — providing results in as little as 10 minutes. Reveal’s lateral flow device combines an immunoassay with chromatography for a rapid and accurate one-step result.
Dehydrated culture media  Neogen’s Acumedia® subsidiary has been recognized since 1978 as a premier manufacturer of high-quality dehydrated culture media for industrial, pharmaceutical, biotech, food safety and life science applications.

The company now has more than 200 diagnostic tests to offer customers, and a comprehensive line of complementary products and services, such as dehydrated culture media to go with unmatched customer support and training. Neogen employs a similar marketing strategy for its veterinary products, offering customers a wide variety of animal safety solutions.

Neogen’s quality management system is ISO 9001 certified, which communicates to the company’s worldwide customer base that it understands the quality standards customers expect, and is firmly committed to achieving those quality standards.

History[edit]
The company was founded by Herbert D. "Ted" Doan and James L. Herbert in 1981 as an investment project by Michigan State University. Due to the $50,000 investment by the university, Michigan State retained 30% of the company shares in the early years after its founding. The purpose of the company was to help strengthen the biotechnology community in Lansing and the state as a whole, which had no large biotech companies at the time, and to help retain molecular biologists within the state.[15] One of the earliest acquisitions for the company was Ideal Instruments Inc. in 1985 in order to utilize their production of veterinary tools.[16]
In 2010, Neogen acquired the genomics-focused company GeneSeek in order to expand their focus on animal genomes and proper heredity and breeding, especially in regards to cattle.[17]
Products[edit]
Neogen focuses on supplying products for bacterial detection and proper sterilization and tool handling with antibiotics, along with genomics research products focused on gene isolation and heredity mapping. The detection products include Reveal for Salmonella Enteriditis,[18] along with Agri-Screen and Veratox for a range of mycotoxin detections.[19] Advancements in hydrophobic grid membrane filter (HGMF) technology led Neogen to the creation of a disposable filter in 2004 called NEO-GRID.[20]
Organization[edit]
The company operates its business through two segments including Food Safety and Animal Safety. The Food Safety segment provides diagnostic kits test and other complementary products for dangerous or unintended substances testing in both human and animal food. The Animal Safety segment is engaged in developing and supplying pharmaceuticals and medical instruments that are used in global veterinary market.[21] The latter segment also produces medicine to control animal disease and rodents in wide industries including agricultural, food production.[22] In 2013, the company acquired Chem-Tech Ltd, which used to by wholly owned by Pat and Kelle Rolfes.[23]

Neogen focuses on supplying products for bacterial detection and proper sterilization and tool handling with antibiotics, along with genomics research products focused on gene isolation and heredity mapping. The detection products include Reveal for Salmonella Enteriditis,[18] along with Agri-Screen and Veratox for a range of mycotoxin detections.[19] Advancements in hydrophobic grid membrane filter (HGMF) technology led Neogen to the creation of a disposable filter in 2004 called NEO-GRID.[20]
Organization[edit]
The company operates its business through two segments including Food Safety and Animal Safety. The Food Safety segment provides diagnostic kits test and other complementary products for dangerous or unintended substances testing in both human and animal food. The Animal Safety segment is engaged in developing and supplying pharmaceuticals and medical instruments that are used in global veterinary market.[21] The latter segment also produces medicine to control animal disease and rodents in wide industries including agricultural, food production.[22] In 2013, the company acquired Chem-Tech Ltd, which used to by wholly owned by Pat and Kelle Rolfes.[23]

History[edit]
The company was founded by Herbert D. "Ted" Doan and James L. Herbert in 1981 as an investment project by Michigan State University. Due to the $50,000 investment by the university, Michigan State retained 30% of the company shares in the early years after its founding. The purpose of the company was to help strengthen the biotechnology community in Lansing and the state as a whole, which had no large biotech companies at the time, and to help retain molecular biologists within the state.[15] One of the earliest acquisitions for the company was Ideal Instruments Inc. in 1985 in order to utilize their production of veterinary tools.[16]
In 2010, Neogen acquired the genomics-focused company GeneSeek in order to expand their focus on animal genomes and proper heredity and breeding, especially in regards to cattle.[17]
Products[edit]
Neogen focuses on supplying products for bacterial detection and proper sterilization and tool handling with antibiotics, along with genomics research products focused on gene isolation and heredity mapping. The detection products include Reveal for Salmonella Enteriditis,[18] along with Agri-Screen and Veratox for a range of mycotoxin detections.[19] Advancements in hydrophobic grid membrane filter (HGMF) technology led Neogen to the creation of a disposable filter in 2004 called NEO-GRID.[20]
Organization[edit]
The company operates its business through two segments including Food Safety and Animal Safety. The Food Safety segment provides diagnostic kits test and other complementary products for dangerous or unintended substances testing in both human and animal food. The Animal Safety segment is engaged in developing and supplying pharmaceuticals and medical instruments that are used in global veterinary market.[21] The latter segment also produces medicine to control animal disease and rodents in wide industries including agricultural, food production.[22] In 2013, the company acquired Chem-Tech Ltd, which used to by wholly owned by Pat and Kelle Rolfes.[23]
