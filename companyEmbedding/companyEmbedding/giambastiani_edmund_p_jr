Early life and education[edit]
Giambastiani was born on May 4, 1948 in Canastota, New York. He graduated from the United States Naval Academy with leadership distinction in 1970. He has been awarded numerous decorations.[citation needed]
Career[edit]
Giambastiani's operational assignments have included several in which he was responsible for both demanding at-sea operations and the development of new technologies and experimental processes. Early sea assignments included USS Puffer (SSN-652) and the USS Francis Scott Key (SSBN-657)'s blue crew. While assigned to USS Puffer, he was a 1973 winner of the Fleet Commander’s Junior Officer Submarine Shiphandling Competition. He commanded the NR-1 Deep Submergence Craft, the Navy's only nuclear powered deep diving ocean engineering and research submarine and USS Richard B. Russell, where the crew was awarded three consecutive Battle Efficiency “E”s, three Navy Unit Commendations, and two Fleet Commander Silver Anchors for excellence in enlisted retention. Giambastiani also led Submarine Development Squadron Twelve, an operational submarine squadron that also serves as the Navy's Warfare Center of Excellence for submarine doctrine and tactics. Established in 1949, Submarine Development Squadron Twelve is the oldest experimental unit of its kind in the U.S. military. He served as the first director of strategy and concepts at the Naval Doctrine Command, as well as Commander, Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force; Commander, Submarines Allied Command Atlantic; and Commander, Anti-Submarine and Reconnaissance Forces Atlantic in Norfolk, Virginia.
Giambastiani's other shore and staff assignments include duties as an enlisted program manager at the Navy Recruiting Command Headquarters, Washington, D.C., in the early days of the all volunteer force; Special Assistant to the Deputy Director for Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency; and, a fellowship with the Chief of Naval Operations' Strategic Studies Group. As a flag officer, he served as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Resources, Warfare Requirements and Assessments for the Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet; Director of Submarine Warfare for the Chief of Naval Operations; Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Resources, Requirements, and Assessments; and as the Senior Military Assistant to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. His previous assignment was as NATO’s first Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) and as Combatant Commander of United States Joint Forces Command, where he led the transformation of NATO and U.S. military forces, capabilities and doctrines and the introduction of new technologies, from October 2, 2002 to August 1, 2005.[2]
In 2003, in his capacity as Commander, United States Joint Forces Command Admiral Giambastiani published a "lessons learned" report.[3] While generally praising U.S. performance it highlighted numerous incidents of friendly fire.
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff[edit]




Giambastiani in May 2007, greeting German Lieutenant General Roland Kather, commander of Kosovo Forces, at the KFOR headquarters in Film City, Kosovo, as American Brigadier General Albert Bryant, Jr., KFOR chief of staff, looks on.


On August 12, 2005, Admiral Giambastiani was sworn in as the seventh Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, becoming the third naval officer to hold that position.
As Vice Chairman, Admiral Giambastiani chaired the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, co-chaired the Defense Acquisition Board, and served as a member of the National Security Council Deputies Committee, the Nuclear Weapons Council and the Missile Defense Executive Board. In addition, he worked with the Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England as Co-Chair of the Deputies Advisory Working Group, which oversees implementation of the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and other high level Departmental business issues.
On May 4–6, 2007, he visited Tunisia, meeting with high-ranking military and civilian officials, including his Tunisian counterparts and Tunisian Foreign Minister Abdelwaheb Abdallah and Defense Minister Kamel Morjane. He went to the North Africa American Cemetery and Memorial on the outskirts of Tunis to pay his respects to fallen U.S. soldiers who had died there during the Tunisia campaign of World War II.
On June 1, 2007, Giambastiani announced his retirement from the military to spend more time with his family and pursue other ventures.[4] He retired on July 27, 2007.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Giambastiani's personal interests include amateur radio, for which he uses the call sign N4OC. He also currently serves as a guiding coalition member of the Project on National Security Reform. He also serves on the Advisory Board of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory and the Board of Trustees of the Mitre Corporation.
On October 8, 2009, Airplane maker Boeing Co. announced that Giambastiani had been elected to its board of directors, effective immediately. The Seattle Times reports that "In a statement, Boeing chairman and chief executive Jim McNerney indicated that the addition of Giambastiani, who was the second-highest ranking officer in the U.S. military, is intended [...] to boost Boeing's influence with the Pentagon."[6]

	Board Member Since 2008

He commanded Submarine NR-1, the Navy's only nuclear-powered deep diving ocean engineering and research submarine, and USS Richard B. Russell (SSN 687). His numerous U.S. and foreign decorations include 19 unit awards and commendations that recognize the accomplishments of his entire team.
He also led Submarine Development Squadron 12, an operational submarine squadron that serves as the Navy's Warfare Center of Excellence for submarine doctrine and tactics. He served as the first director of strategy and concepts at the Naval Doctrine Command, as well as Commander, Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force; Commander, Submarines Allied Command Atlantic; and Commander, Anti-Submarine and Reconnaissance Forces Atlantic.
His other shore and staff assignments included duties as an enlisted program manager at the Navy Recruiting Command Headquarters, Washington, D.C., in the early days of the all-volunteer force; Special Assistant to the Deputy Director for Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency; and a fellowship with the Chief of Naval Operations' Strategic Studies Group.

CANASTOTA - Edmund P. Giambastiani Sr., 87, of Canastota, died Monday, July 17, 2006 at St. Joseph's Hospital, Syracuse, after a brief illness.



He was born on Jan. 31, 1919 in New York City, the son of Edmund V. and Emma Capellino Giambastiani. A graduate of Curtis High School, Staten Island, N.Y., Ed moved to Canastota in 1948 after marrying Adele Grilli in 1947.



A communicant of St. Agatha's Church, Ed was involved with a number of community activities including the Canastota Lions Club and the Canastota Volunteer Fire Dept. An avid golfer and bocce player into his 80s, Ed was also an accomplished tennis player and won several competitions, including the 1939 New York City doubles championship. He also owned and enjoyed flying a Piper Cub, was a life-time ham radio operator (WB2PIU) and a devoted remote-controlled model aircraft builder and flyer who founded and sponsored the Canastota Flying Aces, a model aircraft club. He worked as an electrician at Revere Copper Products in Rome for 18 years, retiring in 1982. He previously owned and operated Canastota Electric Company, an electrical contracting business and hobby store.



Surviving are one son and daughter-in-law, Admiral Edmund P. Jr. and Cynthia Giambastiani of Fort Myer, Va.; one daughter and son-in-law, Barbara Jean and Charles "Ted" Bartlett of Cazenovia; six grandchildren, E. Peter Giambastiani III and his wife, Jennifer Giambastiani, Cathie Giambastiani, Charles Bartlett, Adele Sara Bartlett, Jennifer Giambastiani-Osborne and her husband, John Osborne and Anthony Cherin; four great-grandchildren; as well as several nieces and nephews.

Edmund was predeceased by his wife, Adele in February 1999; a son, James C. "Chic" Giambastiani, who died in 1983; and a brother, Gilbert Giambastiani.



The memorial Mass and burial for Edmund P. Giambastiani Sr., 87, of Canastota, will be in November at St. Agatha's Church, Canastota. At Edmund's request there will be no calling hours. Arrangements are under the supervision of the J. Homer Ball Funeral Home, Inc., 201 James St., Canastota. In lieu of flowers,  the family requests that contributions be made in his memory to The Town of Lenox Veterans' Memorial Fund, 205 S.
