Good afternoon, and thank you for participating in today's conference call to discuss Onvia's financial results for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2015.
Joining us today are Mr. Hank Riner, the President and CEO of Onvia; and Mr. Cameron Way, Onvia's Chief Financial Officer. Following their comments, we will open the call for your questions.
Before I continue, I would like to take a moment to read Onvia's Safe Harbor Statement. This presentation may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as believe, intend, plan, expect, should, indicate and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that are not historical should also be considered forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements in this presentation may relate to, but are not limited to, statements regarding Onvia's future results of operations, the progress to be made by the company, Onvia's future financial flexibility and future cash flows, and Onvia's future product and content offerings. Such statements are based on current expectations that involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual events to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Onvia's go to market strategy fails to increase and retain contract value of customers, Onvia fails to execute properly on new products or customers fail to adopt these products or services, Onvia's investment in the Onvia platform and new content fails to improve sales penetration and client retention rates, and changes made to Onvia's technology infrastructure fails to handle the increased demands on its infrastructure caused by increasing network traffic and the volume of aggregated data.
Additional information on factors that may impact these forward-looking statements can be found in the Business Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections, as applicable, in Onvia's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year December 31, 2014, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
The information contained in this presentation is as of the date indicated, factors or events that could cause Onvia's actual results to differ may emerge from time-to-time and it's not possible for Onvia to predict all of them. We assume no obligation and expressly disclaim any such obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this presentation as a result of new information or future events or developments, except as maybe required by law.
I would like to remind everyone that this call will be available for replay through March 25, 2016. Please refer to today's press release for dial-in replay instructions. A webcast replay will also be available at Onvia's website at www.onvia.com.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Onvia's President and CEO, Mr. Hank Riner. Please proceed go ahead, sir.
Henry Riner
Thank you, Destiny, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and annual 2015 results.
I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Cameron Way, to summarize and comment on our financial results for the quarter and the year ending December 31, 2015. Afterwards, I will review the operating results achieved over the past year and outline our focus for 2016. And finally, we will open the call to your questions. Cam?

Cameron Way
Thank you, Hank. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us.
Our operating initiatives in 2015 were focused on driving growth in subscription revenue and adjusted EBITDA. An important indicator of future subscription revenue is annual contract value or ACV, which represents the total value of our subscription contracts.
Overall, subscription client ACV increased 2% to $22 million as of December 31, 2015 from $21.5 million as of December 31, 2014. The ACV growth were lower than originally planned, largely due to first year client retention and new client ACVC falling below original expectations.
To address first year retention, in mid 2015 we began focusing on the quality of new client acquisition and new client onboarding to improve first year retention long term. We targeted higher quality prospects and focused on solving the client's primary objective, before introducing new solutions for additional objectives.
We also enhanced our client onboarding program in the third quarter of 2015 to help the client successfully implement and realized immediate value from our solution. This shift and focus negatively impacted ACVC an ACV in the short term, but is expected to improve first year client retention in the future.
ACVC is a leading indicator of future subscription revenue, and this focus will delay growth in subscription revenue in the short term. Future revenue growth is dependent on increasing new client acquisition and improving first year retention rates.
Beginning with this quarter, we are now providing more visibility into the progress made within our target market by breaking out our client metrics between strategic accounts and small business. Strategic accounts are those clients from our target market that do business in a broad geographic area and have a long-term strategic interest in the state and local market.
Small business accounts are smaller legacy clients that were sold prior to our change in business model in 2011. ACVC for strategic accounts grew 8% in 2015 over the prior year. Our strategic initiatives, including first year attention, are focused on growing the ACV of strategic accounts.
Annual contract value per client or ACVC continues to improve. ACVC as of December 31, 2015 for the entire customer base increased 12% over December 31, 2014, to an average of $7,283 per client. Growth in ACVC continues to reflect the success of our initiative to acquire more strategic clients and upgrade existing clients into new and higher valued products.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, subscription revenue grew 6% to $5.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year, subscription revenue grew 6% to $21.5 million from $20.3 million in 2014. As I previously discussed, growth in ACV is a leading indicator of growth in subscription revenue.
Total revenue for the quarter was $6 million, up 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And for the full year total revenue was $23.6 million compared to $22.6 million for the full year of 2014, also an increase of 4%. In addition to subscription revenue, total revenue includes content license and report revenues.
Gross margin was 87% and 86% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, respectively, compared to 85% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Our cost of revenue primarily consists of payroll-related expenses associated with the research, capture and enhancement of data in our proprietary database.
We regularly evaluate potential investments in new and enhanced content that could increase the value of our solution to our clients. As previously discussed, certain amounts of cost of revenue for 2014 have been reclassified as operating expenses to conform to current period presentation.

Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015 decreased 2% to $5.3 million from $5.4 million in the same period of 2014.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, we incurred an expense of approximately $200,000 to independently evaluate potential future product offerings and to ensure that our product and content organizations were properly organized to deliver our long-term product and content roadmap. This $200,000 did not reoccur in 2015 in the fourth quarter.
The decrease related to the 2014 special project was partially offset by incremental sales and marketing costs incurred in 2015 required to support our initiative of accelerating future revenue growth.
2015 operating expenses overall increased 4% or $852,000 to $20.9 million compared to $20 million in 2014. The increase in operating expenses is primarily a result of approximately $800,000 of employee separation costs and legal and consulting fees related to special projects incurred in 2015.
The non-recurring legal and consulting fees were authorized by our Board of Directors in the first quarter of 2015, in order to perform a complete review of our content handling processes and systems. And content payroll-related investments made to support our strategic investments in the areas of sales, marketing and product development.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, adjusted EBITDA increased to $513,000 from $226,000 in the same quarter last year. Full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA decreased $566,000 or 23% to $1.9 million compared to $2.5 million in 2014.
The adjusted EBITDA for 2015 and 2014 does not include incentive compensation that would have otherwise been incurred had the company achieved the performance goals required in the executive compensation arrangements. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock-based compensation.
Net loss was $98,000 or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $479,000 or $0.06 per share in Q4 of 2014. Net loss for all of 2015 was $486,000 or $0.07 per diluted share compared to $727 million or $0.10 per share in 2014.
Now, turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments decreased to $6.8 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to $8 million at the end of 2014. In December 2015, we repurchased approximately 350,000 shares of common stock at a price of $3 per share for an aggregate cost of $1,050,000. The repurchased shares are held in treasury stock and are excluded from outstanding shares for the purposes of earnings per share calculations.
For further discussions of these results, our business and financial results and risks and prospects for our business, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed in November and our Form 10-K, which we plan to file in early March.
This completes our financial presentation. I'd like to turn the call back over to Hank. Hank?
Henry Riner
Great. Thanks for the review of our financial results, Cam. The growth in strategic accounts demonstrates the discipline we have shown in defining our target market. And the success we have achieved in understanding this target market and providing our clients with a strong value proposition.
Our 2016 initiatives are focused on improving this value proposition to this market, and improving our financial results by accelerating new client acquisition and improving first year retention rates. In 2016, we will be focused on completing the migration of clients to the Onvia 7 search experience, which will deliver more actionable results to our users and a better search experience.
We'll also focus on improving the ease of use of the platform and delivering enhanced content that will further support our client's business development activities. We believe that the initiatives we began in 2015 will result in improved new client acquisition and first-year retention rates that will strengthen our tenured client base, which will put us on the path of realizing our growth strategy.

We have also built a very strong team to execute our growth strategy. I am pleased to announce the hiring of Alberto Sutton as our new Senior VP of Marketing. Most recently, Alberto was the VP of Global Marketing at Pyramid Analytics in Seattle. We believe that Alberto's strong marketing experience will help us to strengthen our message and reach to our target market. Alberto joined us in the middle of February and he is now responsible for all of our marketing activities.
During the past year we have invested in expanding our leadership team to accelerate our growth. Alberto is the third new member to join the team. You'll recall that Chris Woerner joined us as our Senior VP of Product in May of 2015, and most recently Steve Ritchie joined us as the SVP of Sales in November of 2015. Therefore, we have three new members of our team during the course of the last nine months.
As we discussed our 2015 operating initiatives focused on three areas intended to accelerate growth, our subscription revenue and improved future adjusted EBITDA. The first 2015 initiative was to further accelerate year-over-year bookings growth. The growth was planned in three key areas, sales to new customers, contract enhancements with existing customers and improved retention of existing customers. The measure of success for this initiative included growth in ACV and ACVC, an improvement in dollar retention.
Bookings growth in 2015 was lower than expected. First-year retention rates improved during 2015, but not as much as originally planned. To improve future first-year retention, we have focused on a quality of new clients and the acquisition of new clients, which negatively impacted new client ACVC and acquisition bookings in the short-term. Both factors resulted in lower than planned bookings during the calendar year 2015.
Dollar retention is a measurement of how effectively the client success team has retained and expanded existing subscription contracts. For the 12 months period ended December 31, 2015, dollar retention is 88%, consistent with the same period of last year. Dollar retention can fluctuate from period-to-period due to the mix of first year and tenured clients expiring in each period.
The second 2015 initiative was to enhance the existing Onvia platform and provide improved content, which further aligns to customer needs. This initiative included the continued rollout of Onvia 7 search enhancements to our target audience. Our success measure of this initiative included the effectiveness of product releases and the related impact on ACVC and dollar retention.
We originally planned to have all vertical ontologies completed by 2015. As of December 31, we had completed ontologies for two of our three major verticals, the last vertical will be completed by the second quarter of 2016. Once the ontology is complete, we will begin the process of migrating clients to the new Onvia 7 search paradigm. We expect to migrate clients in our completed market sectors to Onvia 7 by the end of 2016.
The third and final 2015 initiative included improving the existing information technology infrastructure as a means to reduce complexity, accelerate product development and ultimately reduce costs. This initiative was focused on three major areas. The first was moving to an open source search technology in order to increase our capacity for search and improved search speed. First rounds of testing are in progress and we are preparing to roll this out by the end of the first half of 2016.
Secondly, we began working on changes in database structures to allow for faster more agile product enhancements in the future. Finally, we addressed areas where data capture can be further automated to allow for cost effective scaling of data aggregation.

As I previously mentioned, we're focused on executing these initiatives in 2016 intended to build on a results that we achieved in 2015 and further accelerate growth both in subscription revenue and adjusted EBITDA. With the investments that we've made in 2015, in 2016 we believe we can focus on generating topline revenue growth to begin to create leverage from our business model.
Once our fixed costs are covered, adjusted EBITDA should grow faster than revenues and drive value for shareholders. We believe that we made the right investments in 2015 to support accelerating revenue growth by the end of 2016. Just to review, here is the following areas that we have invested in.
We now have new sales and marketing leadership in Steve Ritchie and Alberto Sutton. We have an enhanced product organization to deliver client-driven products and workflows, which is head up by our new product leader Chris Woerner. We are building a more robust content marketing program with compelling and relevant content geared to each specific vertical market that we pursue.
Our business development team has expanded the use of business development associates to generate a new lead qualification program to support higher new acquisition sales. We have expanded our first-year onboarding program for first-year clients to improve first-year retention. And finally, the investment in proprietary Onvia 7 ontologies will give our clients a better search experience, better search results, and we believe higher long-term client retention.
These investments will delay growth in adjusted EBITDA in the short-term. However, if we achieved our planned ACV and revenue growth throughout the year, adjusted EBITDA should begin to accelerate by the end of 2016. Although, our results did not meet our expectations in 2015, we believe that we are well-positioned to accelerate revenue growth in 2016.
That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back to Destiny, so that we can take your questions. Destiny, please go ahead and provide the instructions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Looks like, we'll take our first question from George Melas.
George Melas
Thank you very much for the enhanced information about the strategic account and the small business account. It's really interesting. And maybe I think can you talk about -- it seems like now that you've given this information, you exposed yourself to question about this information, and I will start the process.
The strategic accounts, there has been a nice growth in ACV. I think it's roughly 8% year-over-year. And it's mostly, I imagine from enhanced contracts, because the number of strategic accounts has not grown much, and maybe 2%. So can you maybe talk about that dynamic there and how difficult it is to get these new strategic accounts?
Henry Riner
Yes. It's always difficult, I think, George, in any business to sign-up new customers. But I think for us it's going to get easier in 2016 and beyond for a number of reasons. Number one, we have a much stronger product now than we had a couple of years ago. With Onvia 7 giving a better search experience, we view that as a key differentiator in the marketplace.
We have a much better sales team, a much more experienced business development team with experienced sales leadership, and Steve Ritchie joining us last November. And our marketing programs are starting to kick-in where there is more awareness of us in the marketplace than ever before.
And with the addition of Alberto Sutton, we know that we're going to be able to take the content marketing program down to the individual vertical level and create compelling relevant content for each audience, which will help with awareness engagement and trust within those audiences. So we think we can only get stronger there.

First-year retention has been an issue for us. And we addressed it hand on beginning in the second quarter of 2015. We've created a new first-year retention team that does much more intensive onboarding with new clients. So we can ensure ourselves that the client is using our information and has incorporated our information into their workflows before we start deployment to our tenured account management program.
That is a change for the company. We reorganized that first year group back in October, and while it's early, it's only a few months, signs that we see so far are positive. So I think we have lot of things going on in our favor in the future. And one of the reasons, why we didn't breakout initiatives in 2016 is we feel the business is fast.
We spent the last five years really re-doing the business, restructuring the business, changing the platform, changing our sales process, we think all that's behind us now and that now we're ready to start growing. And once that growth starts to kick in on the topline, we're going to be able to show that operating leverage on the bottomline.
George Melas
And then you sort of try to follow-up and elaborate on that. If you look at your strategic accounts and things like on a net basis, they grew by 25% during the year. How many strategic accounts have you identified out there? And do they all have some capability like you have from you or from competitors or do some of them do it internally. Can you help a little bit understand sort of the landscape how big they are? And how big you are in this space?
Henry Riner
That's a great question. The market itself is about 20,000 companies, 20,000 companies that had state and local government as part of their [technical difficulty]. That means that they are committed to this market long-term. That is our ideal kind of customer. And as you know, George, we redefined that a couple of years ago and that is the market size. Our research tells us that the majority of those companies do it on their own.
Now, there is several different stages. One, they may just be working local agency relationships and they're doing that either through a field sales force or they're doing it through the channel partners, they tend to be the most unsophisticated prospect. And it's the longest buyer journey to get them to adopt our solution, because they're not used to using intelligence.
The next group, the group in the middle that is responding to biz in RFPs and is either trying to do it on their own or they're using one of the many biz services that are out there. And those people are little bit further along their buyer journey and are little bit easier to sell.
And then you have small group of people, who do use forward-looking intelligence, who do get capital improvement plans and budgets from agencies. They use that to get [ph] specced in the projects that do not occur in two, three, four years out. And they are used to using that intelligence, but they're not Onvia customers. Those are the easiest to sell. They're furthest along the buyer journey, because they understand the power of that intelligence and what it can do for them.
So if you look at those 20,000 companies, we've got a small percentage of them today that are customers, 6%, but if you go beyond that, the other 94% really falls into those three categories. The big one is the ones that peoples that have just respond to biz in RFPs, many of them doing it on there own.
George Melas
And of that third category that do use third-party forward-looking intelligence, how big, how would you size that group?
Henry Riner
It's fairly small. I don't have an exact number for you, but it's the smallest of the three sectors.
George Melas
But that's really where your strategic accounts are. Most of your strategic accounts are in that space?

Henry Riner
The strategic accounts are in that space today, but we believe that entire 20,000 company universe is a candidate for our services, we have to educate them on the power of using this intelligence to move their business forward and that's why we're so excited about Alberto joining our organization, that's going to be his charter.
George Melas
But still when we look at the numbers and the sort of the really modest growth in strategic accounts in '15, it seems like the product is getting better, the team is getting better, the marketing program is better, but how do you think that you can grow the ACV for the strategic accounts on a double-digit basis going forward?
Henry Riner
Well, we don't give you a specific numbers. We don't give specific guidance. But I can say this that as the first year program kicks in and we're not losing the amount of first year clients that we were before, by definition we will grow faster. So keep in mind that's a function of really two variables, how many new clients we're bringing in, but how many of those first years that we're losing.
And we're doing a much better job, and it's all about training and on-boarding, getting closer to that new client, because its intelligence has never been used by them before, making sure post-contract that people are using the intelligence, they get the value of it, and they understand the utility of the solution.
And we spend a lot of time and effort in the past five months to fix that and we see some -- it's early. I don't know want to kid, it's very early, but we see some very positive signs so far. So it's a combination of not just signing up new people, but keeping the new ones after signing.
George Melas
But I imagine, if you have retention rate of 88% in the strategic account, it is significantly higher than that.
Henry Riner
Well, remember that the 88% is a blended rate. It's wallet retention, not client retention, so it's dollars. And it's also a blended rate between tenure and first-year. First year is lower than tenure.
George Melas
First year is higher?
Henry Riner
First year is lower.
George Melas
Lower. Okay.
Henry Riner
By definition -- 
George Melas
[multiple speakers] the retention rate is, okay.
Henry Riner
So that 88% is a blended rate between the two.
George Melas
And if you look just at the strategic account, what would be that retention rate?
Henry Riner
We don't publicize that yet, George. We possibly will in the future, as we build the base a little bit more. The reason is, we want to get the base filled out, so the numbers are more significant and more meaningful for you, because it could move around a lot from quarter-to-quarter. But once we get there, we will report on that.
George Melas
And then maybe just a couple additional questions. Tell us how the marketplace has developed in the last two or three years? Are people or sort of this kind of market intelligence being sort of absorbed by larger companies, software companies, project management software companies, what is the landscape looking? And how have those changes favored you or hampered you with potential customers?
Henry Riner
The verticals that we're playing in, the indications are very strong for the future. For example, IT, there is a lot of spending for IT in state and local governments in the foreseeable future, because they are moving from owning IT assets that go into much more of a cloud shared services type environment. So that has provoked the spike in spending for IT.
In infrastructure and construction and the education market, we still seeing a lot of new construction with state and local governments not so much new, but we have a lot of renovation work. And renovation work is a key competitive advantage for Onvia, because we're one of the few out there that really covers those projects. If you look at people like Dodge and people like CMD, they're just covering new construction, they're not covering renovation.

Business services, there are segments of that market that are very strong, where there is much more outsourcing. If you look at local municipalities, they used to do their own billing for water, for sewer, most of that is now being outsourced, especially as the billing function becomes much more electronic versus print through the mail. All those particular municipalities are really not set up to make those investments on their own. They have to outsource it to the third-party, and we have a number of those third-party providers who are good of being customers.
So I think the market is strong. We just published our SLED report, just came out in last week. Buying activity is estimated to be up. It was strong in Q4 of 2015. We're looking at strength in Q1 of 2016. So we believe this is still a great market opportunity. Now, we're defining a category in addition to defining a brand and that's a lot of hard work. But I think we're making good progress doing that. And certainly, by the end of this year we're going to start see the results of that.
George Melas
And just like from another perspective from the point of view of your competitors, how has the market evolved? Now, you're competing really with people who provide sort of comparative information or do you compete with people who have bundled that into sort of a broader suite of product, including some software or some of your key [technical difficulty] some project management?
Henry Riner
You know, George, that Deltek sells information and software and they have their own project management software and they sell information on government projects. But Deltek's strength continues to be in a federal area. We have a number of clients that have us for state and local, and they have Deltek for federal. So there hasn't been much change there.
The big services are still out there that are novice. We believe that we get further and further away from them, as we invest in the platform and we get stronger as a company. You still have the vertical market players like Dodge and CMD, but again, we sell our services as complimentary, so that Dodge and CMD are great for both private and public new construction. We go deeper in public and we cover all the work and renovation. So we have a number of A/E firms and construction companies and infrastructure companies that buy both of those kinds of services.
So there is nobody that is really out there trying to do what Onvia is doing. We have gotten a unique position in the marketplace. We're devoted to [indiscernible]. We're not concerned so much for the federal. And we're taking a much more intensive position in this particular market than anybody that we see out there.
Operator
And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over to the speakers for any closing remarks.
End of Q&A
Henry Riner
Well, thank you, Destiny. And thank you for your questions George, and everybody else for listening on the call today. We appreciate it. Cam and I are available to answer any additional questions you might have. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
