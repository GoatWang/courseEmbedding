Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Stone House is a concentrated, research-intensive, fundamental value investor in the public markets. Stone House's investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation of the Fund's assets primarily through investments in securities of publicly traded companies. Stone House seeks to achieve capital appreciation commensurate with reasonable risk. The Fund generally maintains a long-biased portfolio of U.S. common stocks but may complement these investments with a limited number of short positions, options and other investments. In Stone House's value approach to investing, Stone House seeks to identify and invest Fund assets in opportunities where it believes there is a disconnect between current trading prices and the intrinsic business or asset value. Stone House then concentrates Fund assets in a relatively limited number of investments. Stone House reviews large numbers of possible investments and pursues further research on a subset of these investments.

Stone House's overall investment philosophy is value-driven and predicated on fundamental analysis. Stone House generally seeks companies with strong fundamentals, selling at attractive prices. The Fund invests with a bottom-up perspective, focusing on each individual company rather than a sector or industry bet. The Fund generally does not invest with a macroeconomic focus or in industries that Stone House does not believe it fully understands. The Fund generally makes a relatively limited number of investments. The Fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets in an individual investment, generally resulting in a highly concentrated, undiversified portfolio.
