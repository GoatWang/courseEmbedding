LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Golden Entertainment, Inc. (NASDAQ: GDEN), based in Las Vegas, announced 
      today that Charles Protell will be named Executive Vice President, Chief 
      Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.
    


      Mr. Protell, 42, has had nearly a 20-year career in corporate advisory 
      and investment banking, most recently as a Managing Director of 
      Investment Banking for Macquarie Capital, covering the gaming, lodging 
      and leisure sectors. Prior to Macquarie Capital, he held similar 
      investment banking positions with REGAL Capital Advisors, Credit Suisse, 
      Deutsche Bank, and CIBC World Markets. Mr. Protell has closed more than 
      70 capital raising and advisory transactions with a total value of 
      approximately $55 billion, including acting as advisor to Golden 
      Entertainment’s predecessor companies in various capacities since 2010. 
      He acted as advisor to Lakes Entertainment in the merger transaction 
      with Sartini Gaming, which created Golden Entertainment in July 2015. In 
      addition, Mr. Protell previously acted as advisor to Sartini Gaming on 
      various initiatives, including its acquisition of distributed gaming 
      operations and casino assets from Affinity Gaming.
    

      As Chief Strategy Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Protell will 
      oversee the Company’s strategic planning, business development, 
      financial reporting and treasury functions, including SEC reporting as 
      well as maintaining investor and lender relationships.
    

      “Charles offers Golden Entertainment a wealth of investment banking 
      experience and relationships that come with a track record of successful 
      transactions in the gaming industry,” said Blake L. Sartini, Chairman, 
      President and CEO of Golden Entertainment. “We have known Charles for 
      many years, and look forward to using his skill set to accelerate and 
      enhance our ability to evaluate and pursue opportunities to increase 
      shareholder value.”
    

      “I am fortunate to have the opportunity to join Golden Entertainment at 
      a time when the Company is positioned for meaningful organic growth and 
      has the right capital structure to actively pursue strategic 
      acquisitions,” stated Mr. Protell. “I believe the Company’s leadership 
      in distributed gaming and regional casinos provides Golden Entertainment 
      unique access to opportunities, and I look forward to helping Blake and 
      his team execute on those opportunities in the near future.”
    

      In addition, Gary Vecchiarelli will be joining Golden Entertainment as 
      Senior Vice President of Finance and Accounting. Mr. Vecchiarelli, 39, 
      has over 15 years of professional experience in various senior 
      accounting and finance roles. Since 2012, Mr. Vecchiarelli has acted as 
      Chief Financial Officer of Galaxy Gaming, a publicly traded company and 
      the world’s largest independent provider of casino table games and 
      related equipment. Prior to Galaxy Gaming, Mr. Vecchiarelli served in 
      numerous public accounting roles, including with firms such as BDO USA, 
      LLP, McGladrey & Pullen, LLP and Crawford, Pimentel & Co., Inc. While at 
      BDO, Mr. Vecchiarelli played a key role in helping to open and establish 
      BDO’s Las Vegas audit practice.
    

      Golden Entertainment’s current Chief Financial Officer, Matthew 
      Flandermeyer, is leaving the Company on November 28, 2016, to pursue 
      family business opportunities. Mr. Flandermeyer has agreed to provide 
      consulting services to Golden Entertainment for up to six months to 
      facilitate an orderly transition of his responsibilities. Mr. Protell 
      will begin his employment with the Company by December 1, 2016, and Mr. 
      Vecchiarelli will begin his employment with the Company by January 3, 
      2017.
    

      “We want to welcome Charles and Gary to our team, as well as express our 
      gratitude to Matt for his contributions to Golden Entertainment during 
      our evolution as a public company,” Mr. Sartini said. “We wish him the 
      best in pursuing new opportunities and thank him for ensuring that the 
      transition of his role will be managed appropriately.”

I have an address on my credit report that I've never lived at. Also amounts that I've owed are marked closed and I've been paying this debt off on time for 4yrs. Where can I get help resolving these issues?

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Get a small personal loan what you're asking for your payment to be about $170 to $180 a month

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Bluebird Prepaid Card


                                            Bluebird is okay, but the issue I have is not many establishments accept American Express. I went to a gas station and swiped at the pump and received an error. So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on "E". It's a good thing...show more

Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with
