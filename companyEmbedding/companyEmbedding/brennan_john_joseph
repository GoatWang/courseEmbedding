John Joseph Brennan

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For the Vanguard Group Chairman and CEO, see John Brennan (Vanguard CEO).
John Joseph Brennan (1913–1976), usually known as John Brennan, was a Northern Irish politician. He stood for the British House of Commons in Belfast West at the 1959 UK general election, representing the Independent Labour Group, receiving 37.6% of the vote.
In 1962 he stood for the Belfast Falls constituency at the 1962 Northern Ireland election, before becoming a founder member of the National Democratic Party.
Under the National Democratic banner, Brennan won Belfast Central at the 1965 Northern Ireland election without facing an opponent - the only member of that party to win election at this level.
However, at the 1969 Northern Ireland election, he was defeated by Paddy Kennedy of the Republican Labour Party.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Airbus said it was on track to meet a target of 10 A350 deliveries a month by the end of 2018 as it hit a milestone of 100 deliveries since Europe's newest wide-body jet came into service, but doubts remained over its A320neo plans. Airbus Chief Operating Officer and President of Commercial Aircraft Fabrice Bregier reaffirmed the A350 target after delivering a A350-900 jetliner to China Airlines.

New onshore wind capacity dipped in France in the first six months of 2017 compared with the same period a year ago as operators slowed the development of projects because of policy and economic uncertainties, an industry lobby said on Tuesday.

GE's stock has dropped on the day that the last six quarterly reports were released. General Electric Chief Executive Jeff Immelt has one more earnings report to cement his legacy, and recent history suggests it may be best for investors to prepare to be disappointed--again. GE is scheduled to reveal second-quarter results on Friday, July 21, before the market opens.

















                                                    GE's stock falls as Jeff Immelt's 64th and last quarter is another disappointment

Shares suffered the worst one-day post-earnings performance in over four years. Shares of General Electric Co. (GE) tumbled to the lowest close in nearly two years on Friday, as outgoing Chief Executive Jeff Immelt ended his reign of the industrial conglomerate with a downbeat outlook. But Friday's share weakness may come as little surprise to long-term investors.

This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal. General Electric Co. (GE), a company in transition that also is changing its CEO, told investors Friday that they would have to wait four months to hear the new boss's strategy for boosting results. GE investors, who have missed out on the broader stock market's rally, were in no mood to be patient.

U.S. stocks closed lower Friday, with the Dow industrials finishing lower for the week, as General Electric Co.' s outlook cast a cloud over earnings season, which is just getting started. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.71 points, or 0.2%, to close at 21,580.07, with shares of GE falling 2.9% and shares of Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) helping to lead blue chips lower. For the week, the Dow finished 0.3% lower, snapping a two-week win streak.

General Electric Co.

GE improved its cash flow and ramped up cost-cutting efforts-- two areas of investor focus-- in Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's last quarter at the helm. But the Boston-based conglomerate tempered profit expectations for the current year and said investors would have to wait...
