About WOLVERINE WORLD WIDE, INC.

   Wolverine World Wide has the shoes to quiet your barking dogs. The company makes Hush Puppies casual shoes and slippers, as well as boots, sandals, and related apparel and accessories. Its boot lines include Merrell (outdoor), Bates (military), HyTest, and Wolverine (industrial); footwear is made under the Cushe brand and private labels. Wolverine also boasts several licenses from Caterpillar ("CAT") and Harley-Davidson, to make branded footwear. It sells worldwide through department and specialty stores, independent distributors, Internet retailers, and about 360 company-owned retail stores in the US and Canada. Wolverine also maintains more than 60 consumer-direct Internet sites.
   Operations

   Wolverine designs, manufactures, sources, markets, licenses, and distributes branded footwear, apparel, and accessories. Prior to fiscal 2016, the company operated in three reportable segments: Lifestyle Group, largest segment (37% of sales), Performance Group (37%), and Heritage Group (22%).
  

   The company realigned its segments into four in fiscal 2016: Wolverine Outdoor & Lifestyle Group (Merrell, Cat, Hush Puppies, Sebago brands and Chaco and Cushe footwear); Wolverine Boston Group (Sperry, Saucony and Keds brands and apparel); Wolverine Heritage Group (Wolverine, Bates uniform footwear, Harley-Davidson and HyTest footwear) and Wolverine Multi-Brand Group (Stride Rite brand and multi-brand consumer-direct businesses).
  
Geographic Reach

   Wolverine's footwear brands are sold in about 200 countries and territories in the US and Canada as well as Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region. The US accounted for two-thirds 72% of the company's fiscal 2016 (January year end) sales, followed by Europe, Middle East and Africa (13%), and Canada (5%) while the remainder came from other countries.
  

   The company's manufacturing operations are conducted in Michigan and it maintains distribution operations in Louisville, Kentucky; Howard City, Michigan; Cedar Springs, Michigan; Rockford, Michigan; Ontario, Canada; and Brookville, Ohio.
  

   The company operated 360 retail stores in the US and Canada and 61 consumer-direct websites in fiscal 2016.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Wolverine markets directly through retail stores and also through a network of third-party distributors, sales representatives, licensees and joint ventures. Its brand-specific marketing plans vary and may include print and radio advertising, search engine optimization, social networking sites, event sponsorships, in-store point-of-purchase displays, promotional materials and sales and technical assistance. The company directly sells its products to a range of customers, including department stores, national chains, catalog retailers, specialty retailers, mass merchants and internet retailers, governments and municipalities. Wolverine also uses a network of independent Shoemobile distribution outlets to distribute some work and occupational footwear brands at industrial facilities.
  
Financial Performance

   The company's net revenues decreased by 3% in fiscal 2016 due to lower sales from the Lifestyle Group and the Heritage Group. The decline in Lifestyle Group revenues was due to a drop in Stride Rite sales resulting from the closure of retail stores, while the Hush Puppies' decline was due to strategic reductions in the US department store channel.
  

   Heritage Group's sales dip was due to the decline in revenues from Cat and Sebago as a result of a strengthened US dollar, while the Wolverine brand declined due primarily to unseasonably warm winter weather and higher inventory levels at key retail partners.
  

   Performance Group revenues were flat for the year.
  

   In 2016 Wolverine's net income decreased by 10% due to lower net revenues and an increase in restructuring and impairment costs, related to the company's decision to wind-down operations of its Cushe brand and indefinite-lived intangibles of its Stride Rite brand.
  

   The company's operating cash flow was $215.5 million in fiscal 2016.
  
Strategy

   Wolverine focuses on marketing campaigns and strategies in order to increase awareness of, and affinity for, the company's brands. The strategy will enhance the positioning of its brands, extend its brands into complementary product categories, expand geographically and expand its consumer-direct operations.
  

   In 2015 the company invested in digital marketing and omni-channel initiatives. Its ecommerce nearly accounted for 20% growth in revenues, primarily in mobile. The company sold  around 42 million units outside North America, contributing to an expanded geographic reach for brands. In 2016 it continued to strengthen its brands in digital, ecommerce, and mobile.
  

   The company seeks to position its three largest brands, Merrell, Sperry and Saucony, for future global expansion and growth in 2016. In 2015, Saucony launched the new EVERUN technology. Sperry focused on pushing beyond boat shoes and developing as a lifestyle brand with boots and sneakers, as well as introducing the new Paul Sperry collection. The Merrell brand planned to launch hiking and trail running products in conjunction with go-to-market executions with key global retailers.
  

   Wolverine initiated a restructuring plan in 2014, for realignment of the company's consumer-direct operations. As a part of the plan, the company closed 136 retail stores in connection (which included 58 retail stores in fiscal 2014, 46 retail stores in fiscal 2015, and the remainder in 2016).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
