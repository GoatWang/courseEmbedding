Employment
History
Established in 1956, TTE continues its pioneering leadership role in the design, development, and manufacture of high quality RF and microwave filters.  Initially, TTE manufactured LC filters in the frequency range of 5 Hz to 100 kHz.  Today, TTE filters are available for any frequency from 100 Hz to 26 GHz – and to 40 GHz in some instances.  Most of TTE’s products are custom-made and built-to-order.  All TTE products are made in the USA and include a limited warranty.  TTE provides and maintains a quality assurance program based on MIL-Q-9858  and MIL-I-45208.


Passive filter products include bandpass, band rejection, highpass, lowpass, high power lowpass and cavity designs covering the RF and Microwave frequency spectrum. Diplexer and multiplexer designs are also available for applications requiring multi-functionality. Design capabilities include LC, combline and microstrip; topologies include Bessel, Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptical Function and Gaussian. TTE has particular expertise in THD filter designs.
Filters from TTE are used by OEMs and other organizations around the world to enhance communication and signal processing in cellular, data acquisition, electronic support, radar, satellite, sonar, telecommunication, telemetry and wireless applications in commercial, industrial, medical and military/defense environments.
TTE is a leader in customer service – with Speed Quotes, rapid turnaround, inventory management and other systems in place – and provides timely and effective responses to customer requests.  The company maintains a large inventory of standard materials to enable delivery of most products within 2 weeks.  Expedited lead times, as short as 3-5 days, are available on certain products.
For additional information refer to Capabilities, Product Overview and Products.
TTE Filters is an affiliate of Gowanda Holdings.
