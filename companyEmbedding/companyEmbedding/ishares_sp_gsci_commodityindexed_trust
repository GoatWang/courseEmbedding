The number of shares or contracts traded in a security or an entire market during a given period of time.

Important Information

 

This information must be preceded or accompanied by a current prospectus. Investors should read it carefully before investing.


The iShares® S&P GSCI® Commodity-Indexed Trust (the “Trust”) has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus and other documents the Trust has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting www.iShares.com or EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the Trust will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-800-474-2737.

The iShares® S&P GSCI® Commodity-Indexed Trust (the “Trust”) is a commodity pool, as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act and the applicable regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or “CFTC,” and is operated by its “Sponsor,” iShares® Delaware Trust Sponsor LLC, a commodity pool operator registered with the CFTC. BlackRock Fund Advisors or “BFA,” is an indirect subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. that serves as the commodity trading advisor, or the “Advisor,” of the Trust and is registered with the CFTC. BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”), a broker-dealer and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) member, provides promotional support to the Trust. BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), a national banking association, is the Trustee of the Trust. BFA, BRIL and BTC are affiliates of BlackRock, Inc. (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”). The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, as amended. Shares of the Trust are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds.

Investments in shares of the Trust are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. You could lose all or a substantial portion of your investment in the shares of the Trust. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other information included in the prospectus. The value of the shares of the Trust, which seeks to track the S&P GSCI® Total Return Index (“Index”), depends on the value of the Index Futures (as such term is defined below) and cash or other collateral assets used to satisfy applicable margin requirements for those Index Future positions. Index Futures are exchange-traded index future contracts on the S&P GSCI-ER, and may include contracts of different terms and expirations over time. Commodities markets have historically been extremely volatile. The trading of commodity futures contracts may be illiquid. In addition, suspensions or disruptions of market trading in the commodities markets and related futures markets may adversely affect the value of your Shares. Shares may outperform or underperform the Index.

The price you receive upon the sale of your shares may be less than their NAV. The NAV will fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Trust’s assets, and market supply and demand. Brokerage commissions and fees will reduce returns.

Although shares of the Trust may be bought or sold on the exchange through any brokerage account, shares of the Trust are not redeemable from the Trust except in one or more blocks of 50,000 units called Baskets. Only institutions that become Authorized Participants may purchase or redeem Baskets.

Shares of the Trust may not provide the anticipated benefits of diversification from other asset classes. The lack of an active trading market for the shares may result in losses on your investment at the time of disposition of your shares. Diversification may not protect against market risk.

The Trust issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets. Please note that, since the shares of the Trust are expected to reflect the price of commodities, as described more fully in the prospectus, held by the Trust, the market price of the shares will be as unpredictable as the price of those commodities have historically been.

The price received upon the sale of shares of the Trust, which trade at market price, may be more or less than the value of the commodities represented by them. If an investor sells the shares at a time when no active market for them exists, such lack of an active market will most likely adversely affect the price received for the shares. For a more complete discussion of risk factors relative to the Trust, carefully read the prospectus.

Following an investment in the Trust, several factors may have the effect of causing a decline in the prices of the commodities and a corresponding decline in the price of the shares. Among them: (i) a change in economic conditions, such as a recession, can adversely affect the price of the commodities. These commodities are used in a wide range of industrial applications, and an economic downturn could have a negative impact on its demand and, consequently, its price and the price of the Trust; (ii) a significant change in the attitude of speculators and investors towards the commodities. Should the speculative community take a negative view towards the commodities, a decline in world commodities prices could occur, negatively impacting the price of the Trust; (iii) a significant increase in the commodity price hedging activity by commodities producers.

The Trust is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard & Poor’s or its affiliates. Neither Standard & Poor’s, nor its affiliates, make any representation regarding the advisability of investing in the Trust.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.


Although BlackRock shall obtain data from sources that BlackRock considers reliable, all data contained herein is provided “as is” and BlackRock makes no representation or warranty of any kind, either express or implied, with respect to such data, the timeliness thereof, the results to be obtained by the use thereof or any other matter.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares ETF and BlackRock Mutual Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.


Shares of ETFs are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined for most ETFs), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.


Index returns are for illustrative purposes only. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results.


After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.


Certain sectors and markets perform exceptionally well based on current market conditions and iShares Funds can benefit from that performance. Achieving such exceptional returns involves the risk of volatility and investors should not expect that such results will be repeated.


Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, a person must receive a copy of "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." Copies of this document may be obtained from your broker, from any exchange on which options are traded or by contacting The Options Clearing Corporation, One North Wacker Dr., Suite 500, Chicago, IL 60606 (1-888-678-4667). The document contains information on options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation. The document discusses exchange traded options issued by The Options Clearing Corporation and is intended for educational purposes. No statement in the document should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a security or to provide investment advice. If you need further information, please feel free to call the Options Industry Council Helpline. They will be able to provide you with balanced options education and tools to assist you with your iShares options questions and trading. The Options Industry Council Helpline phone number is 1-888-Options (1-888-678-4667) and its website is www.888options.com.

Alphabet falls after earnings beat: Live blog
              
              Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after the market closes Monday, and they'll be hit by a $2.74 billion fine from the European Union's antitrust regulator. Outside of the fine, analysts project a strong quarter for the company, thanks to advertising revenue from Google sites, particularly on mobile devices, and YouTube.

Fed to stick to plans for rate hike, balance-sheet selloff this year
              
              The Federal Reserve doesn’t want to leave any doubt: The central bank still plans to raise interest rates again this year and start to sell off its vast holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-related bonds. The Fed just plans to take its own sweet time doing so.
