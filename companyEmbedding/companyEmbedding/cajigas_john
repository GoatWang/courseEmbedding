                                Report abuseTranscript of Austrobaileyales and Magnoliids AUSTROBAILEYALES and MAGNOLIIDSFlowersFlower stalks are axillary to (on the opposite side of shoot from) leaf scars on old wood and sometimes from leaves on new shoots. The flowers are usually trimerous; borne singly or in compound inflorescences; bisexual and rarely unisexual. The receptacle might become enlarged, elevated or flat. Usually two to four persistent sepals that are distinct or connate (fused) at the base. Six petals in two unequal whorls of three with larger outer whorls and fleshier inner whorls that might share the same nectar glands, or six to fifteen petals, with impressed veins on their inner face.  Each flower can have from one to many pistils, distinct to connate, with stigmas distinct.  Style short and thick, with terminal stigma.Fruits and seedsFruits are single berries or coalesce from several pistils (into aggregate fruit, syncarps). Seeds are one to many per pistil; have a fleshy and usually brightly colored cover, have ruminate endosperm (nutritive tissue surrounding the embryo) and are oily.AUSTROBAILEYALESis an order of flowering plants, consisting of about 100 species of woody plants growing as trees, shrubs and lianas.  APG II (2003) consist of four families: family Austrobaileyaceae, one species of woody vines from Australia; family Schisandraceae   [+ family Illiciaceae], several dozen species of woody plants, found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and the Caribbean; and family Trimeniaceae, half-a-dozen species, of woody plants found in subtropical to tropical Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and the Pacific IslandsMAGNOLIIDSMagnoliids (or Magnoliidae) are a group of about 9,000 species of flowering plants, including magnolias, nutmeg, bay laurel,cinnamon, avocado, black pepper, tulip tree and many others. They are characterized by trimerous flowers, pollen with one pore, and usually branching-veined leavesThis group, recognized by APG II (2003), contains thefour orders Laurales, Magnoliales, Canellales, and Piperales. MAGNOLIALESThe Annonaceae are a family, the custard apple family, of flowering plants consisting of trees, shrubs, or rarely lianas. With 2106 accepted species and more than 130 genera, it is the largest family in Magnoliales.AustrobaileyaceaeIlliciaceae*SchisandraceaeTrimeniaceaeAustrobaileya is the sole genus with the sole recognised species of lianas, that constitutes the entire flowering plant family Austrobaileyaceae.The species Austrobaileya scandens grows naturally only (endemic) in the Wet Tropics rainforests of north eastern Queensland, Australia.The plant has a distinctive blue-green color foliage. Austrobaileya has large and solitary flowers that are arranged in a spiral with pale green petals. Flowers are pollinated by flies. To attract pollinators, A. scandens’ flowers release a rotting fish smell.Their fruits are apricot-coloured and contain tightly packed seeds, similar in shape to chestnuts. The fruit is shaped like a pear or eggplant. Fruits have been known to grow to sizes of 7 cm in length by 5 cm.The APG II system treated Illiciaceae as a family that may either be treated as part of another family, the Schisandraceae or allows for the optional segregation of the Illiciaceae from the Schisandraceae. The Illiciaceae as an optional segregate family then has the traditional circumscription of other taxonomic systems, consisting of a single genus, Illicium. The updated APG III system of 2009 does not recognize this family and includes Illicium in the Schisandraceae.The family consists of shrubs or small trees usually with volatile aromatic compounds. The leaves are evergreen, simple, alternate, spiral (sometimes crowded towards the tips of the twigs), leathery, petiolate, pinnately veined, non-sheathing, gland-dotted or not gland-dotted; also are aromatic, or without marked odour. The lamina is entire.The flowers are hermaphrodite, and usually showy, ranging in size from small to large, and composed of numerous distinct parts that change grade slightly as they spiral around the receptacle. The parts begin with a perianth of whorled tepals, with the outer whorls more sepaloid, graduating to more petaloid inner tepals. The stamens are also numerous and in a whorl. The carpels are arranged in a whorl, are separate, and number from 5 to numerous carpels in each whorl, each carpel containing a single ovule.The stem presents nodes unilacunar (with one trace), with internal phloem absent, secondary thickening developing from a conventional cambial ring, xylem with tracheids; The sieve-tube plastids are S-type.The fruit is non-fleshy; the fruiting carpel is dehiscent, with a follicle (the cycle of follicles often spreading radially in a stellate pattern) and presents only one seed. The seeds are copiously endospermic and oily. The embryo is well differentiated (very small), achlorophyllous.Schisandraceae is a family of flowering plants. This family consists of woody plants, containing essential oils.  The family Schisandraceae, consists of two genera,  Schisandra and Kadsura, totalling several dozen species, which are found in tropical to temperate regions of East and Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.Trimeniaceae is a family of flowering plants. Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists, at least for the past several decades.It is a small family of one genus (or possibly two) with half-a-dozen species, of woody plants, bearing essential oils. The family issubtropical to tropical and found in Southeast Asia, eastern Australia and the Pacific Islands.LAURALESThe Laurales are an order of flowering plants. They are magnoliids, related to the Magnoliales.The order includes about 2500-2800 species from 85-90 genera, which comprise seven families of trees and shrubs. Most of the species are tropical and subtropical, though a few genera reach the temperate zone. The best known species in this order are those of theLauraceae (for example bay laurel, cinnamon, avocado, and Sassafras), and the ornamental shrub Calycanthus of the Calycanthaceae.The Lauraceae are distinguished in being perennial trees or shrubs [rarely vines] with aromatic oil glands, evergreen leaves, an undifferentiated perianth, valvular anther dehiscence, and a single, superior ovary having one ovule per carpel with apical placentation, seeds lacking endosperm.The Magnoliales comprise six families  of flowering plants: Annonaceae, Degeneriaceae, Eupomatiaceae, Himantandraceae, Magnoliaceae, and Myristicaceae.Mostly tropical, some mid-latitude, deciduous or evergreen trees and shrubs, some lianas, with aromatic bark, leaves, and flowers.Stems, stalks and leavesBark is fibrous and aromatic. Pith septate (fine tangential bands divided by partitions) to diaphragmed (divided by thin partitions with openings in them).Branching distichous (arranged in two rows/on one plane) or spiral.Leaves are alternate, two-ranked, simple, pinnately veined, and have leaf stalks. Stipules absent.Annonaceae cont.The Magnoliaceae  are a flowering plant family, the magnolia family, in the order Magnoliales. It consists of two subfamilies: Magnolioideae, of which Magnolia is the most well-known genus, and Liriodendroidae, a monogeneric subfamily, of which Liriodendron (tulip trees) is the only genus.MagnoliaceaeMagnoliaceae cont.The monophyly of Magnoliaceae is supported by a number of shared morphological characters among the various genera in the family. Most have bisexual flowers (with the exception of Kmeria and some species of Magnolia section Gynopodium), showy, fragrant, radial, and with an elongated receptacle. Leaves are alternate, simple, and sometimes lobed. The inflorescence is a solitary, showy flower with indistinguishable petals and sepals. Sepals range from six to many; stamens are numerous and feature short filaments which are poorly differentiated from the anthers. Carpels are usually numerous, distinct, and on an elongated receptacle or torus. The fruit is an etario of follicles which usually become closely appressed as they mature and open along the abaxial surface. Seeds have a fleshy coat and color that ranges from red to orange (except Liriodendron). Magnoliaceae flowers are beetle pollinated, except for Liriodendron, which is bee pollinated. The carpels of Magnolia flowers are especially thick to avoid damage by beetles that land, crawl, and feast on them. The seeds of Magnolioideae are bird dispersed, while the seeds of Liriodendron are wind dispersed.CANELLALESCanellales is the botanical name for an order of flowering plants, one of the four orders of the magnoliids. It is defined to contain two families: Canellaceae and Winteraceae, which comprise 136 species of fragrant trees and shrubs.The Canellaceae are found in tropical America and Africa, and the Winteraceae are part of the Antarctic flora (found in diverse parts of the southern hemisphere).The Canellaceae are a family of flowering plants in the order Canellales. The order includes only one other family, the Winteraceae. Canellaceae is native to the Afrotropic and Neotropic ecozones. They are small to medium trees, rarely shrubs, evergreen and aromatic. The flowers and fruit are often red.The Winteraceae are a mostly Southern Hemisphere family associated with the Antarctic flora, found in tropical to temperate climate regions of Malesia, Oceania, eastern Australia, New Zealand, Madagascar and the Neotropics. Many members of the family are fragrant, and are used to produce essential oils.PIPERALESThe Piperales, APG II (2003), contain five families: Aristolochiaceae, Hydnoraceae, Lactoridaceae, Piperaceae, and Saururaceae. Notable amongthe others are the achlorphyllous, parasitic Hydnoraceae. It necessarily includes the family Piperaceae but otherwise has been treated variously over time. Well-known plants which may be included in this order include black pepper, kava, lizard's tail, birthwort, and wild ginger. AristolochiaceaeThe Aristolochiaceae are distinguished in being usually climbing plants, having an enlarged , petaloid calyx, an absent to reduced corolla, often adnate stamens (forming a gynostemium), and an inferior to half-inferior, 4–6-carpeled and loculed ovary.They are mostly perennial, herbaceous plants, shrubs, woody vines or even lianas.The membranous, cordate simple leaves are spread out, growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks. The margins are commonly entire. There are no stipules.The bizarre flowers are large to medium-sized, growing in the leaf axils. They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical.PiperaceaeThe Piperaceae are distinctive in having an atactostelic stem, a spadix with numerous, very small, unisexual or bisexual flowers lacking a perianth, the ovary solitary, 1-ovulate, the fruit a 1-seeded berry or drupe.Members of pepper family are small trees, shrubs, or perennial or annual herbs.Roots and stemsPlants are often rhizomatous, and can be terrestrial or epiphytic. The stems can be either simple or branched.LeavesLeaves are simple with entire margins, and are positioned at the base of the plant or along the stem, and can be alternate, opposite, or whorled in arrangement. Stipules are usually present, as are petioles. The leaves are often noticeably aromatic when crushed.FlowersInflorescences (in the form of spikes) are terminal, opposite the leaves, or located in the axils. Flowers are bisexual, with no perianth, each flower is subtended by a peltate bract. Stamens are 2-6, and hypogynous, with 2-locular anthers. There are usually 3-4 stigmas attached to a single pistil per flower, which is 1 or 3-4 carpellate. The ovary is 1 locular, and superior.Fruits and seedsFruits are drupelike, with a single seed per fruit. The seeds have a minute embryo, and mealy perisperm.SaururaceaeThe Saururaceae are distinctive in being perennial herbs with a bracteate spike or raceme and with flowers lacking a perianth, the ovary solitary, many-ovulate, the fruit a capsule.The leaves are spiral, simple, and stipulate, the stipules adnate to the petiole. The inflorescence is a bracteate spike or raceme, with involucrate bracts enlarged and petal like in some taxa. The flowers are bisexual, hypogynous. The perianth is absent. The stamens are 3, 3+3, or 4+4, apostemonous, adnate to base of the gynoecium in some taxa. Anthers are longitudinal in dehiscence. The gynoecium is syncarpous or apically apocarpous, with a superior ovary, 3 5 carpels, and one locule. The styles are 3 5. Placentation is parietal (to marginal in Saururus); ovules are orthotropous to hemitropous, bitegmic, 1 10 per ovary. The fruit is an apically dehiscent capsule. The seeds are perispermous. Stems have 1 or 2 vascular bundle rings.Prepared by: Cajigas, Jethro John M.Tumandao, ArjelynFor: Mrs. Lea Magarce-CamangegInstructor, BIO 22/L Plant SystematicsFull transcriptMore presentations by
