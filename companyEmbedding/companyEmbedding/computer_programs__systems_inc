Questions? 1-385-985-3330


Fullbay Heavy Duty Shop Software works on any device connected to the internet.
A few years ago, we searched for decent software to run a diesel repair shop. The search came up empty. Most of the software out there was built for light duty, and none of it truly solved the right problems. So we built something that did.
We baked 18 years of experience in the diesel repair industry into Fullbay. The result is that Fullbay solves problems no one else is tackling. It’s cloud based, so you don’t have to be in the shop to use it. You log into it like you’re logging into the bank. It also reduces comebacks and eliminates unauthorized work. Plus it drops invoices right into Quickbooks.
So far, shops that use Fullbay see about a 30% increase in revenue per tech. Fullbay makes the business run very efficiently. It also lowers the stress level around the shop. It’s possible Fullbay could do the same for you. If you have a heavy duty repair shop or mobile service, give us 30 minutes to show you Fullbay. You can request a demo here.


Benefits




 


												Free yourself from the shop											
You will accomplish more and feel in control while not having to be at the shop. You log into Fullbay just like you log into any website. Fullbay lives in the cloud so you can run your operation from anywhere. 

						Read more						 




 


												Truly satisfy the customer											
Customers can submit a repair request in their own words, in their portal or mobile app. The tech can focus on being the customer's hero. Customers can also manage their units, request service, see PM history, approve work and pay invoices. 

						Read more						 




 


												Never get behind on invoicing again											
No more assembling your documentation from stacks of paper. No more getting days or weeks behind. Invoices create with the click of a button and immediately appear in Quickbooks Online. 

						Read more						 





 


												See real time stats											
Use Fullbay's real-time statistics and reports to instantly see efficiency metrics. Have the data to make mid-day course corrections. You will make more money and avoid costly mistakes.




 


												Give your techs more time to make money											
Your techs document repairs on a phone or tablet, and only need to write something once. Fullbay works just as well on the side of the road as it does in the shop. Customer authorization is faster. Parts ordering is faster. Techs get more done in less time.




 


												Connect the apps you already use											
Break down your silos of information with powerful integrations to apps you already use. Cloud-based software is special because it easily communicates with other cloud apps, in real time. Fullbay is the only cloud-based heavy duty shop management software on the market.





 


												Never have an invoice dispute with a customer again											
Estimates build so fast in Fullbay, and it is so easy to get them in front of the customer, the entire authorization process becomes a pleasure. Customers feel the pain of the repair cost before the repair is actually done, and you have thorough, searchable documentation of their authorization. When the invoice comes, there are no surprises.




 


												Give customers a better history on their units than hospitals have on their patients											
Fullbay was built to be an "electronic medical record" for trucks, and we have taken the most innovative ideas from the EMR world and applied them to Fullbay. See the full service history for any unit and easily search it by component, system, part, or service date.




 


												Never leave a part off an invoice again											
Technicians cannot complete their work until all parts have been received in the system. This innovation means parts will never be left off a customer invoice, saving you hundreds or thousands per month.





 


												Eliminate interruptions											
Give yourself longer periods of uninterrupted work time. You'll get a lot more done, you'll feel less stressed, and you'll be able to go home and feel like you accomplished something at the end of the day. 

						Read more						 




 


												Get onto your customers' mobile devices											
Submitting a repair request is always just a tap away for your customers. You will have a lot of good work coming in, and your phones won't be ringing off the wall. Your sales increase, customers are happier, and your reputation in the community and the industry will increase.




 


												Have a packaged business you can sell											
Fullbay automates so much of the day to day that you are free to work on your business, not just in it. Your shop becomes a nice, neat package that you will be able to sell one day and retire, instead of just shutting it down.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

You’ll gain real skills in collaboration, be able to adapt to new structures, create innovative ways of working, and be comfortable working with data and using a wide spectrum of tech-forward tools.
P2D2 is a key component of what makes TechPath a smart, new way of getting the knowledge you need to be ready to hit the ground running in the new way successful companies work today.
We’re proud to offer our TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs to new students at a 20% savings1.TechPath degree programs are noted below.
1TechPath Associate and Bachelor’s degree programs are offered to new students at the cost of $487 per credit hour, which is 20% lower than our Non TechPath rate at $609. 20% savings is applicable to those who apply after 4/21/2017.
