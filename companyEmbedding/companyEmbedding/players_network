As far as current product goes, I have a few friends that tried their rosin and said it was one of the best highs they have ever had and they smoke daily.  The product quality Greenleaf is putting out is top notch and testing at the highest level in Nevada by independent testing source.  Just a matter of time with this play until they are firing on all cylinders.  I am planning a trip back to Vegas in October and look forward to touring the facility again and seeing how things have changed from my early July trip.  I'm sure well be trading in the upper .20's to low .30's by then.  IMO

I believe the MJ product will eventually get to the consumer, but under the terms of the Alcohol distributors.  Somehow, MJ producers needs to have some direct say on their products.  Producers know their product is consumed not a distributor.  I believe, the Alcohol people are going to hold product so consumers will have to use Alcohol.  If a dispensary sells Medical MJ and Rec MJ, they will have different ways to get the product on their store shelves?  Doesn't make sense to me!
