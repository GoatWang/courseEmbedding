Overview[edit]




The Technion Computer Science Faculty.


T3 is staffed by an 11-member team whose focus is to commercialize new ideas in science and technology from Technion in Israel, by finding investors and entrepreneurs to develop commercial applications. This includes licensing intellectual property and the establishment of start-up companies. The team has been described as "the private sector's gateway to Technion innovation".[1]
As of 2011, 424 patents were granted to Technion innovations, with 845 patents pending. T3's partners include incubators, entrepreneurs, private investors, venture capitalists and angel groups. It also conducts strategic partnerships with multinational companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Philips, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, and others.
The name T3 was taken to represent the three 'Ts' in Technion Technology Transfer, and to indicate that scientific breakthrough is taken to another dimension (cubed) when developed and applied as solutions in the real world.[2]
Since 2005, the unit has been managed by Benjamin Soffer, a lawyer who has served on the board of directors of companies including Genegraft, SLP Ltd, Regentis Biomaterials, EORD, Guide-X and Slender Medical. Soffer was special advisor to Israel's Chief Scientist at the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade.[3]
Commercialization strategies[edit]
T3's strategy is to escort Technion technologies from the initial point of discovery, through the process of development and licensing, to the formation of ventures with industry. Commercialization strategies are tailored to the requirements of each venture, in order to enhance the market value and performance of Technion discoveries and increase their success in the global marketplace.[4] This includes:

Analysis of new inventions and concepts developed at the Technion
Licensing technologies developed at the Technion
Incorporation of spin-off companies based on Technion IP
Participation in the board of directors of affiliated companies
Negotiation and approval of the IP and business aspects of agreements with industry[5]

Major developments[edit]

Rasagiline

Rasagiline is a drug to treat Parkinson's disease discovered by[6] Prof. Moussa B.H. Youdim of Technion and John Finberg. It was developed in collaboration with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd, in Israel. Having won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the drug is now marketed worldwide as AzilectTM.[7][8]
Start-ups formed with T3 patents[edit]

Mazor Surgical Technologies: Mazor has pioneered the development of miniature, semirobotic bone-mounted positioning systems for a range of orthopedic procedures.
Biosense Inc.: A company that developed a 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation technology.
FineTech: offering sophisticated chemical products and services to the pharmaceutical industry.
Regentis Biomaterials Ltd.: a medical material development company involved in the cartilage repair market.
Corindus Ltd.: a company providing robotic technologies for catheterizing laboratories and radiology/special procedure suites.
Pluristem Therapeutics- engaged in the development of human placental adherent stromal cells for commercial use in disease treatment.

Examples of T3 patents[edit]

Novel hypergolic fuel[9]
Source of intense coherent high-frequency radiation[9]
Three-dimensional video scanner[10]
Highly sensitive, real-time structural monitoring[11]
Compact direction finding antenna[12]
Silicon air batteries[13]
GeomCore - outstanding 3D graphics[13]
Adaptive queue management (software and algorithms)[13]
Tandem eletrocyte fuel cell[13]
Learning control scheme for hybrid vehicles[13]

Programs[edit]
Entrepreneur in residence program[edit]
The unit runs an Entrepreneur In Residence program, in which global entrepreneurs are recruited and are given the chance to license new Technion technologies. The program normally requires a minimal amount of equity and the presentation of a business plan. As part of its effort to attract entrepreneurs, the group uses its network of venture capitalistss, Incubators, head-hunting firms and service providers.[14]
Finders[edit]
The Technion liaises with global professionals from various industries, in order to spread information about Technion innovations to potential partners.
Mentorship program[edit]
The Mentorship Program (based mainly on Technion alumni) T3 engages serial entrepreneurs as mentors to fledgling entrepreneurs/researchers. These mentors offer their experience, network and understanding of industry and provide insights as to the preferred commercialization route or application. The mentor is often engaged as a paid consultant supporting the commercialization efforts,
Investment opportunities fund[edit]
The Technion has secured an internal US$10 million fund called the Technion Investment Opportunities Fund. The fund invests in syndication with other investors and aims to preserve the equity stake in Technion related companies.
Internal applicable research funds[edit]
One of the biggest challenges in technology transfer is the gap between early research products, and the level of evidence investors need to support further research. The Technion's internal applicable research funds are aimed at bridging this gap by taking promising projects beyond the proof of concept stage.[15]
Awards[edit]
The Technion awards researchers, inventions, developments and publications from its scientists that have a profit potential. The goal of the award is to encourage entrepreneurship in research. The researchers are rated based on commercial applicability (such as potential market share), and technological maturity.[16]
The Technion network[edit]
The American Technion Society and global Technion societies have created an international network. Many members of Technion Societies are prominent leaders in their respective fields. T3 makes every use of this international source of expertise in the service of its on-going commercialization effort.[17]
Outsideactivities[edit]
Webinars[edit]
The Technion has initiated a webinar program aimed at presenting Technion innovation to an audience of investors, industry leaders, entrepreneurs, corporate executives, in-licensing officers and service providers. The purpose of this program is to increase visibility and to assist in marketing and commercialization efforts.[18][19][20] Independently, T3 maintains an active presence in the social media on LinkedIN,[21] Facebook[22] and Twitter.
MBA – global patent course[edit]
This program is the result of a combined effort by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, T3 and Technion's MBA program. Within this initiative, MBA students (an equal amount of Israeli and American students from Maryland University and Harvard University), collaborate on a business plan aimed at commercializing patents and technologies developed by Technion researchers.[23] The course offers hands-on experience in commercialization and starting a company involving a real-life innovation. At the end of the course, students present their business plan to a group of seasoned venture capitalist and serial entrepreneurs.
Internal technology transfer seminars[edit]
The group conducts seminars and workshops to Technion faculty and graduate students dealing with different aspects of commercialization, e.g., patenting, entrepreneurship, finance, fund raising, licensing, company formation[24]
Professional conferences[edit]
The members of the team presents in national and international conferences related to commercialization, licensing, and technology transfer. These include the Israeli, European and US Biomed conferences,[25] AUTM conferences,[26] and Nanotechnology conferences.[27]
AMIT[edit]
The Technion is the first university outside of the U.S. selected by Alfred E. Mann to be a part of his network of Alfred Mann Institutes (AMIs). The Alfred Mann Institute at the Technion (AMIT) was established with an endowment exceeding US$100 million.[28] Among the patents developed by AMIT is the electronic nose to sniff out cancer, invented by Hossam Haick[29]

Overview[edit]




The Technion Computer Science Faculty.


T3 is staffed by an 11-member team whose focus is to commercialize new ideas in science and technology from Technion in Israel, by finding investors and entrepreneurs to develop commercial applications. This includes licensing intellectual property and the establishment of start-up companies. The team has been described as "the private sector's gateway to Technion innovation".[1]
As of 2011, 424 patents were granted to Technion innovations, with 845 patents pending. T3's partners include incubators, entrepreneurs, private investors, venture capitalists and angel groups. It also conducts strategic partnerships with multinational companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Philips, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, and others.
The name T3 was taken to represent the three 'Ts' in Technion Technology Transfer, and to indicate that scientific breakthrough is taken to another dimension (cubed) when developed and applied as solutions in the real world.[2]
Since 2005, the unit has been managed by Benjamin Soffer, a lawyer who has served on the board of directors of companies including Genegraft, SLP Ltd, Regentis Biomaterials, EORD, Guide-X and Slender Medical. Soffer was special advisor to Israel's Chief Scientist at the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade.[3]
Commercialization strategies[edit]
T3's strategy is to escort Technion technologies from the initial point of discovery, through the process of development and licensing, to the formation of ventures with industry. Commercialization strategies are tailored to the requirements of each venture, in order to enhance the market value and performance of Technion discoveries and increase their success in the global marketplace.[4] This includes:

Analysis of new inventions and concepts developed at the Technion
Licensing technologies developed at the Technion
Incorporation of spin-off companies based on Technion IP
Participation in the board of directors of affiliated companies
Negotiation and approval of the IP and business aspects of agreements with industry[5]

Major developments[edit]

Rasagiline

Rasagiline is a drug to treat Parkinson's disease discovered by[6] Prof. Moussa B.H. Youdim of Technion and John Finberg. It was developed in collaboration with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd, in Israel. Having won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the drug is now marketed worldwide as AzilectTM.[7][8]
Start-ups formed with T3 patents[edit]

Mazor Surgical Technologies: Mazor has pioneered the development of miniature, semirobotic bone-mounted positioning systems for a range of orthopedic procedures.
Biosense Inc.: A company that developed a 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation technology.
FineTech: offering sophisticated chemical products and services to the pharmaceutical industry.
Regentis Biomaterials Ltd.: a medical material development company involved in the cartilage repair market.
Corindus Ltd.: a company providing robotic technologies for catheterizing laboratories and radiology/special procedure suites.
Pluristem Therapeutics- engaged in the development of human placental adherent stromal cells for commercial use in disease treatment.

Examples of T3 patents[edit]

Novel hypergolic fuel[9]
Source of intense coherent high-frequency radiation[9]
Three-dimensional video scanner[10]
Highly sensitive, real-time structural monitoring[11]
Compact direction finding antenna[12]
Silicon air batteries[13]
GeomCore - outstanding 3D graphics[13]
Adaptive queue management (software and algorithms)[13]
Tandem eletrocyte fuel cell[13]
Learning control scheme for hybrid vehicles[13]

Programs[edit]
Entrepreneur in residence program[edit]
The unit runs an Entrepreneur In Residence program, in which global entrepreneurs are recruited and are given the chance to license new Technion technologies. The program normally requires a minimal amount of equity and the presentation of a business plan. As part of its effort to attract entrepreneurs, the group uses its network of venture capitalistss, Incubators, head-hunting firms and service providers.[14]
Finders[edit]
The Technion liaises with global professionals from various industries, in order to spread information about Technion innovations to potential partners.
Mentorship program[edit]
The Mentorship Program (based mainly on Technion alumni) T3 engages serial entrepreneurs as mentors to fledgling entrepreneurs/researchers. These mentors offer their experience, network and understanding of industry and provide insights as to the preferred commercialization route or application. The mentor is often engaged as a paid consultant supporting the commercialization efforts,
Investment opportunities fund[edit]
The Technion has secured an internal US$10 million fund called the Technion Investment Opportunities Fund. The fund invests in syndication with other investors and aims to preserve the equity stake in Technion related companies.
Internal applicable research funds[edit]
One of the biggest challenges in technology transfer is the gap between early research products, and the level of evidence investors need to support further research. The Technion's internal applicable research funds are aimed at bridging this gap by taking promising projects beyond the proof of concept stage.[15]
Awards[edit]
The Technion awards researchers, inventions, developments and publications from its scientists that have a profit potential. The goal of the award is to encourage entrepreneurship in research. The researchers are rated based on commercial applicability (such as potential market share), and technological maturity.[16]
The Technion network[edit]
The American Technion Society and global Technion societies have created an international network. Many members of Technion Societies are prominent leaders in their respective fields. T3 makes every use of this international source of expertise in the service of its on-going commercialization effort.[17]
Outsideactivities[edit]
Webinars[edit]
The Technion has initiated a webinar program aimed at presenting Technion innovation to an audience of investors, industry leaders, entrepreneurs, corporate executives, in-licensing officers and service providers. The purpose of this program is to increase visibility and to assist in marketing and commercialization efforts.[18][19][20] Independently, T3 maintains an active presence in the social media on LinkedIN,[21] Facebook[22] and Twitter.
MBA – global patent course[edit]
This program is the result of a combined effort by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, T3 and Technion's MBA program. Within this initiative, MBA students (an equal amount of Israeli and American students from Maryland University and Harvard University), collaborate on a business plan aimed at commercializing patents and technologies developed by Technion researchers.[23] The course offers hands-on experience in commercialization and starting a company involving a real-life innovation. At the end of the course, students present their business plan to a group of seasoned venture capitalist and serial entrepreneurs.
Internal technology transfer seminars[edit]
The group conducts seminars and workshops to Technion faculty and graduate students dealing with different aspects of commercialization, e.g., patenting, entrepreneurship, finance, fund raising, licensing, company formation[24]
Professional conferences[edit]
The members of the team presents in national and international conferences related to commercialization, licensing, and technology transfer. These include the Israeli, European and US Biomed conferences,[25] AUTM conferences,[26] and Nanotechnology conferences.[27]
AMIT[edit]
The Technion is the first university outside of the U.S. selected by Alfred E. Mann to be a part of his network of Alfred Mann Institutes (AMIs). The Alfred Mann Institute at the Technion (AMIT) was established with an endowment exceeding US$100 million.[28] Among the patents developed by AMIT is the electronic nose to sniff out cancer, invented by Hossam Haick[29]

The purpose of this program is to increase visibility and to assist in marketing and commercialization efforts.[18][19][20] Independently, T3 maintains an active presence in the social media on LinkedIN,[21] Facebook[22] and Twitter.
MBA – global patent course[edit]
This program is the result of a combined effort by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, T3 and Technion's MBA program. Within this initiative, MBA students (an equal amount of Israeli and American students from Maryland University and Harvard University), collaborate on a business plan aimed at commercializing patents and technologies developed by Technion researchers.[23] The course offers hands-on experience in commercialization and starting a company involving a real-life innovation. At the end of the course, students present their business plan to a group of seasoned venture capitalist and serial entrepreneurs.
Internal technology transfer seminars[edit]
The group conducts seminars and workshops to Technion faculty and graduate students dealing with different aspects of commercialization, e.g., patenting, entrepreneurship, finance, fund raising, licensing, company formation[24]
Professional conferences[edit]
The members of the team presents in national and international conferences related to commercialization, licensing, and technology transfer. These include the Israeli, European and US Biomed conferences,[25] AUTM conferences,[26] and Nanotechnology conferences.[27]
AMIT[edit]
The Technion is the first university outside of the U.S. selected by Alfred E. Mann to be a part of his network of Alfred Mann Institutes (AMIs). The Alfred Mann Institute at the Technion (AMIT) was established with an endowment exceeding US$100 million.[28] Among the patents developed by AMIT is the electronic nose to sniff out cancer, invented by Hossam Haick[29]

Overview[edit]




The Technion Computer Science Faculty.


T3 is staffed by an 11-member team whose focus is to commercialize new ideas in science and technology from Technion in Israel, by finding investors and entrepreneurs to develop commercial applications. This includes licensing intellectual property and the establishment of start-up companies. The team has been described as "the private sector's gateway to Technion innovation".[1]
As of 2011, 424 patents were granted to Technion innovations, with 845 patents pending. T3's partners include incubators, entrepreneurs, private investors, venture capitalists and angel groups. It also conducts strategic partnerships with multinational companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Philips, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, and others.
The name T3 was taken to represent the three 'Ts' in Technion Technology Transfer, and to indicate that scientific breakthrough is taken to another dimension (cubed) when developed and applied as solutions in the real world.[2]
Since 2005, the unit has been managed by Benjamin Soffer, a lawyer who has served on the board of directors of companies including Genegraft, SLP Ltd, Regentis Biomaterials, EORD, Guide-X and Slender Medical. Soffer was special advisor to Israel's Chief Scientist at the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade.[3]
Commercialization strategies[edit]
T3's strategy is to escort Technion technologies from the initial point of discovery, through the process of development and licensing, to the formation of ventures with industry. Commercialization strategies are tailored to the requirements of each venture, in order to enhance the market value and performance of Technion discoveries and increase their success in the global marketplace.[4] This includes:

Analysis of new inventions and concepts developed at the Technion
Licensing technologies developed at the Technion
Incorporation of spin-off companies based on Technion IP
Participation in the board of directors of affiliated companies
Negotiation and approval of the IP and business aspects of agreements with industry[5]

Major developments[edit]

Rasagiline

Rasagiline is a drug to treat Parkinson's disease discovered by[6] Prof. Moussa B.H. Youdim of Technion and John Finberg. It was developed in collaboration with Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd, in Israel. Having won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, the drug is now marketed worldwide as AzilectTM.[7][8]
Start-ups formed with T3 patents[edit]

Mazor Surgical Technologies: Mazor has pioneered the development of miniature, semirobotic bone-mounted positioning systems for a range of orthopedic procedures.
Biosense Inc.: A company that developed a 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation technology.
FineTech: offering sophisticated chemical products and services to the pharmaceutical industry.
Regentis Biomaterials Ltd.: a medical material development company involved in the cartilage repair market.
Corindus Ltd.: a company providing robotic technologies for catheterizing laboratories and radiology/special procedure suites.
Pluristem Therapeutics- engaged in the development of human placental adherent stromal cells for commercial use in disease treatment.

Examples of T3 patents[edit]

Novel hypergolic fuel[9]
Source of intense coherent high-frequency radiation[9]
Three-dimensional video scanner[10]
Highly sensitive, real-time structural monitoring[11]
Compact direction finding antenna[12]
Silicon air batteries[13]
GeomCore - outstanding 3D graphics[13]
Adaptive queue management (software and algorithms)[13]
Tandem eletrocyte fuel cell[13]
Learning control scheme for hybrid vehicles[13]

Programs[edit]
Entrepreneur in residence program[edit]
The unit runs an Entrepreneur In Residence program, in which global entrepreneurs are recruited and are given the chance to license new Technion technologies. The program normally requires a minimal amount of equity and the presentation of a business plan. As part of its effort to attract entrepreneurs, the group uses its network of venture capitalistss, Incubators, head-hunting firms and service providers.[14]
Finders[edit]
The Technion liaises with global professionals from various industries, in order to spread information about Technion innovations to potential partners.
Mentorship program[edit]
The Mentorship Program (based mainly on Technion alumni) T3 engages serial entrepreneurs as mentors to fledgling entrepreneurs/researchers. These mentors offer their experience, network and understanding of industry and provide insights as to the preferred commercialization route or application. The mentor is often engaged as a paid consultant supporting the commercialization efforts,
Investment opportunities fund[edit]
The Technion has secured an internal US$10 million fund called the Technion Investment Opportunities Fund. The fund invests in syndication with other investors and aims to preserve the equity stake in Technion related companies.
Internal applicable research funds[edit]
One of the biggest challenges in technology transfer is the gap between early research products, and the level of evidence investors need to support further research. The Technion's internal applicable research funds are aimed at bridging this gap by taking promising projects beyond the proof of concept stage.[15]
Awards[edit]
The Technion awards researchers, inventions, developments and publications from its scientists that have a profit potential. The goal of the award is to encourage entrepreneurship in research. The researchers are rated based on commercial applicability (such as potential market share), and technological maturity.[16]
The Technion network[edit]
The American Technion Society and global Technion societies have created an international network. Many members of Technion Societies are prominent leaders in their respective fields. T3 makes every use of this international source of expertise in the service of its on-going commercialization effort.[17]
Outsideactivities[edit]
Webinars[edit]
The Technion has initiated a webinar program aimed at presenting Technion innovation to an audience of investors, industry leaders, entrepreneurs, corporate executives, in-licensing officers and service providers. The purpose of this program is to increase visibility and to assist in marketing and commercialization efforts.[18][19][20] Independently, T3 maintains an active presence in the social media on LinkedIN,[21] Facebook[22] and Twitter.
MBA – global patent course[edit]
This program is the result of a combined effort by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, T3 and Technion's MBA program. Within this initiative, MBA students (an equal amount of Israeli and American students from Maryland University and Harvard University), collaborate on a business plan aimed at commercializing patents and technologies developed by Technion researchers.[23] The course offers hands-on experience in commercialization and starting a company involving a real-life innovation. At the end of the course, students present their business plan to a group of seasoned venture capitalist and serial entrepreneurs.
Internal technology transfer seminars[edit]
The group conducts seminars and workshops to Technion faculty and graduate students dealing with different aspects of commercialization, e.g., patenting, entrepreneurship, finance, fund raising, licensing, company formation[24]
Professional conferences[edit]
The members of the team presents in national and international conferences related to commercialization, licensing, and technology transfer. These include the Israeli, European and US Biomed conferences,[25] AUTM conferences,[26] and Nanotechnology conferences.[27]
AMIT[edit]
The Technion is the first university outside of the U.S. selected by Alfred E. Mann to be a part of his network of Alfred Mann Institutes (AMIs). The Alfred Mann Institute at the Technion (AMIT) was established with an endowment exceeding US$100 million.[28] Among the patents developed by AMIT is the electronic nose to sniff out cancer, invented by Hossam Haick[29]

Programs[edit]
Entrepreneur in residence program[edit]
The unit runs an Entrepreneur In Residence program, in which global entrepreneurs are recruited and are given the chance to license new Technion technologies. The program normally requires a minimal amount of equity and the presentation of a business plan. As part of its effort to attract entrepreneurs, the group uses its network of venture capitalistss, Incubators, head-hunting firms and service providers.[14]
Finders[edit]
The Technion liaises with global professionals from various industries, in order to spread information about Technion innovations to potential partners.
Mentorship program[edit]
The Mentorship Program (based mainly on Technion alumni) T3 engages serial entrepreneurs as mentors to fledgling entrepreneurs/researchers. These mentors offer their experience, network and understanding of industry and provide insights as to the preferred commercialization route or application. The mentor is often engaged as a paid consultant supporting the commercialization efforts,
Investment opportunities fund[edit]
The Technion has secured an internal US$10 million fund called the Technion Investment Opportunities Fund. The fund invests in syndication with other investors and aims to preserve the equity stake in Technion related companies.
Internal applicable research funds[edit]
One of the biggest challenges in technology transfer is the gap between early research products, and the level of evidence investors need to support further research. The Technion's internal applicable research funds are aimed at bridging this gap by taking promising projects beyond the proof of concept stage.[15]
Awards[edit]
The Technion awards researchers, inventions, developments and publications from its scientists that have a profit potential. The goal of the award is to encourage entrepreneurship in research. The researchers are rated based on commercial applicability (such as potential market share), and technological maturity.[16]
The Technion network[edit]
The American Technion Society and global Technion societies have created an international network. Many members of Technion Societies are prominent leaders in their respective fields. T3 makes every use of this international source of expertise in the service of its on-going commercialization effort.[17]
Outsideactivities[edit]
Webinars[edit]
The Technion has initiated a webinar program aimed at presenting Technion innovation to an audience of investors, industry leaders, entrepreneurs, corporate executives, in-licensing officers and service providers. The purpose of this program is to increase visibility and to assist in marketing and commercialization efforts.[18][19][20] Independently, T3 maintains an active presence in the social media on LinkedIN,[21] Facebook[22] and Twitter.
MBA – global patent course[edit]
This program is the result of a combined effort by the Dingman Center for Entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, T3 and Technion's MBA program. Within this initiative, MBA students (an equal amount of Israeli and American students from Maryland University and Harvard University), collaborate on a business plan aimed at commercializing patents and technologies developed by Technion researchers.[23] The course offers hands-on experience in commercialization and starting a company involving a real-life innovation. At the end of the course, students present their business plan to a group of seasoned venture capitalist and serial entrepreneurs.
Internal technology transfer seminars[edit]
The group conducts seminars and workshops to Technion faculty and graduate students dealing with different aspects of commercialization, e.g., patenting, entrepreneurship, finance, fund raising, licensing, company formation[24]
Professional conferences[edit]
The members of the team presents in national and international conferences related to commercialization, licensing, and technology transfer. These include the Israeli, European and US Biomed conferences,[25] AUTM conferences,[26] and Nanotechnology conferences.[27]
AMIT[edit]
The Technion is the first university outside of the U.S. selected by Alfred E. Mann to be a part of his network of Alfred Mann Institutes (AMIs). The Alfred Mann Institute at the Technion (AMIT) was established with an endowment exceeding US$100 million.[28] Among the patents developed by AMIT is the electronic nose to sniff out cancer, invented by Hossam Haick[29]

Starting New Companies









UMass Amherst is Bullish on Start-ups!

	To help UMass Amherst ideas and inventions benefit the public, and to help grow the Massachusetts economy, UMass Amherst is creating services to help people like you start new companies.

	EIR contact information for all programs can be found here: EIR Referral Form

An Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) Can Get You Started.

	            Every new business starts with an idea.  Your idea may be well thought out, or it may be a flash of inspiration!  And, like most university people, you may have little or no experience in business.  The UMass Amherst EIR Program was created to provide you and others with a welcoming starting point for exploring business ideas, and to provide knowledgeable guidance on how to turn those business ideas into new companies.  

	            The UMass Amherst EIRs are volunteers that have deep experience in the business world.  They have created and developed new products, and have started and built new companies.  Each EIR has experience in one or more specific product fields, but their business expertise is relevant in all fields. They have office hours on campus so that anyone in the UMass Amherst community, including undergraduate students, grad students, postdocs and faculty, can easily get confidential information and advice on the potential value of their business ideas and how to pursue them, no matter how undeveloped those ideas may be. 

	            You can find biographies and contact information for the current UMass Amherst EIRs at this link: EIR Bios. Please call Maryanne Laukaitis at the UMass Amherst Technology Transfer Office, 413-577-2126, or email her at maryanne@research.umass.edu.  Or, you can email this form to Maryanne, EIR Sign-up Form, and she will contact you to set up the first meeting.

The “Envisioning Process” Can Help You Launch a Technology Company.

	            If you make an invention or create software in the course of your UMass research, the Technology Transfer Office’s Envisioning Process can help you turn it into a new business.  This tutorial program for faculty members, grad students and postdocs is a series of five meetings in which the Technology Transfer Office provides nuts-and-bolts information and advice about incorporation, defining products and markets, corporate finance and other essentials for starting a technology-based company.

	You can sign up for the Envisioning Process by submitting this form:  Envisioning Sign-up

	An outline of what is discussed at the meetings is here:  Envisioning Outline

	The following guides are based on the Envisioning Process:

	            How to pick a good company name

	            Taking an option to license IP rights from UMA

	            What to expect in licensing from UMA

	 

The Berthiaume Center Can Teach and Inspire You.

	            The Berthiaume Center for Entrepreneurship, located at the Eisenberg School of Management, teaches undergraduate and graduate school courses on entrepreneurship.  It also sponsors the Innovation Challenge, the HackUMass Hackathon, and other events to encourage and support entrepreneurs.  You can learn more at their website: Berthiaume Center for Entrepreneurship.

	 

The Institute for Applied Life Science (IALS) Can Lease You Lab Space.

	As part of its focus on applied research, IALS has created two “co-laboratories” where, for a modest monthly fee, start-up companies can rent 6 feet of bench space in a shared lab, which includes use of a fume hood and conference rooms.  The IALS labs are newly-constructed in 2016.  Although IALS research is focused on life science, rental lab space may also be available for companies in other fields.  IALS also provides start-up companies with access to 30 core research centers (microscopy, MRI, calorimetry, DNA sequencing, and many others).  To learn more, contact Andrew Vinard, 577-4582, avinard@umass.edu

	 

The Maroon Fund May Be Willing to Fund Your Company.

	            Maroon Venture Partners Fund I, LP is a for-profit venture fund that invests in early stage companies linked to UMass Amherst. It typically invests $50,000 to $200,000, and it often provides a new company’s first outside equity funding. It looks for companies that can use its funds to accomplish significant milestones toward commercial success. The fund’s broader goal is to foster the growing spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship throughout the UMass Amherst community.  You can learn more and apply here:  Maroonventurepartners.com

	 

As Your Technology Company Grows, the UMass Fund May Be Willing to Invest.

	            The UMass Fund invests in new companies based on inventions or software made in the course of UMass research.   It is managed by the Office of Technology Commercialization and Ventures (OTCV) in the Office of the President.  Investments can be made solely, or together with investments by a qualified venture capital firm or angel investor.  Investments are limited to $500,000, and are usually made in several installments based on the company reaching incremental product development goals.  More information can be found here: UMass Fund

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Technology Select Sector Index (IXTTR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the technology sector which includes the following industries: computers and peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors and semi-conductor equipment; internet software and services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments and components; wireless telecommunication services; and office electronics. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Technology Select Sector Index (IXTTR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the technology sector which includes the following industries: computers and peripherals; software; diversified telecommunications services; communications equipment; semiconductors and semi-conductor equipment; internet software and services; IT services; electronic equipment, instruments and components; wireless telecommunication services; and office electronics. One cannot directly invest in an index.

The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
