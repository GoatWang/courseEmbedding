            New York, NY- September 8, 2016— C-III Capital Partners LLC (“C-III”), a leading commercial real estate investment management company, announced today that it has successfully completed its acquisition of Resource America, Inc. (NASDAQ: REXI) (“Resource America”) as of September 8, 2016.

Pursuant to the transaction, Resource America stockholders will be entitled to receive $9.78 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $207 million. Resource America’s common stock will cease trading on the NASDAQ effective September 8, 2016. 
“This is a transformative acquisition for C-III,” said Andrew L. Farkas, Chairman and CEO of C-III. “With our expanded platform, we are now able to provide commercial real estate debt and equity solutions to both institutions and retail investors. Today, we are well-positioned for further growth and to better serve the needs of our clients, and as well as those of the evolving commercial real estate industry.”  
The combination of C-III and Resource America draws on the best of both legacy organizations to create a diverse suite of commercial real estate services with a broad platform of investment products. C-III’s expanded platform now manages in excess of $13 billion in assets, is the named special servicer for $79 billion of commercial mortgage loans and manages over 57,000 apartment units across the U.S. Through the acquisition of Resource America, C-III adds one publicly traded REIT (Resource Capital Corp.; NYSE: RSO), four non-traded REITs and two registered investment companies to its portfolio, and will be able to leverage Resource America’s existing capital-raising infrastructure through the independent broker-dealer network. 
Current clients of C-III’s commercial mortgage servicing, commercial real estate lending, investment management, property management and real estate brokerage subsidiaries will continue to receive the same level of high-caliber service.
