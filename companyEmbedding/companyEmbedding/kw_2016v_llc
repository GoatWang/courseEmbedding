(Thanks everyone to provide feedback to on the rule and make it as a better game)

	Let's assume you will have 100k cash on your hand and you will have to buy and hold the stock pick by you for a duration of 1 year. 

	 - Buy and Hold Period: 31-Dec-2016 - 31-Dec-2017

	 - Each participant have to choose for a minimal of 5 and max of 10 stocks or Company Warrant which  is not expire before 31-Dec-2017 (no Call Warrant, Put warrant or any other Derivative) where the stock price have to more than RM0.10 on 30-Dec-2016 4:50pm

	 - Each participant cannot invest > 30% of capital on any single stock - Each selected company (include the mother stock and warrants) is limited to a maximum investment of RM 30,000

	 - Each participant have to invest 99% of the cash (a min of 99k investment) but not choose to keep the cash (anywhere this is a stock pick contest but not a cash keeping contest)

	 - The stock price shall follow the closing price of the stock on 30-Dec-2016.

	 - Your portfolio and analysis will be created and a link will be added in the TOC's section at Stock Pick 2017 Blog.

	 - For each transaction, we shall apply 0.1% brokerage fee (min RM8) + other misc fee as per i3investor portfolio tools standard

	 - no margin, or borrowing... the available cash is your trading limit

	-  dividend, stock split, bonus issue, etc.... will be recorded and it will be part of your profit, i will share you the edit access for your portfolio(see the following screenshot), and you can add in the transaction accordingly. Please state the comments on your portfolio after you have included dividends, stock splits, bonus issues, etc....  for updating / tracking purposes.  [please don't modify your buy transactions to make sure we follow the buy & hold rule of the game ]

	 



	 

	-  In the event  that you have excess cash in your portfolio (from the dividends based on payment date), you can reinvest and buy more stocks ( can be existing or new provided the maximum is 10). You should able to create a buy transaction once I share you the access).   On the same note, please leave comments on your portfolio after you have made further purchases updating /tracking purposes. [Note: I will not able to help to maintain all portfolios. By participating in this competition, you should agree to take care of your own portfolio.]

	 - How to Add a Transaction? Click the [Add Transaction] button as attached photo in your portfolio and choose the Transaction Type Accordingly.

	 

	 



	 



	 

	- If you don't update your portfolio for more than a 2 months [or by 31-Dec-2017] after a corporate exercise (e.g. split, bonus, etc.) , your portfolio will be remove from the stock pick contest. 

	- The total value in the portfolio as at the close of trading on 31st December 2017 will be the basis in determining the final results of the contest. 

	 - If you agree on the rule and would like to participate in the year 2017 stock pick, please provide the stock pick and allocation for each stock from 30-Dec-2016 4:50pm - 03-Jan-2017 8:00 am   by leave a comment on this post. (please don't submit it now as you will never know the stock price. I will only take the submission after 30-Dec-2016 4:50pm) 

	- I hope more peoples can join this stock pick challenge and we can learn from each others... but I have limitation to setup too much portfolio, and I will open it to 50 participants (on a first come firtst serve basic).

	 - p/s: I  will reserve the seat for the first 20 runners on Year 2015 and  Year 2016 stock pick respectively. These 40 paricipants (or less than 40 as I am sure it will be a duplication on the first 20 runners for year 2015 and 2016)  can submit it eventhought there is more than 50 participants - at most, we will have 90 participants. The seat will be reserve until 06-Jan-2017 8:00 am.  

	- If the submission come after 03-Jan-2017 8:00 am, the latest closing price on the submission date  will be used instead of the 30-Dec-2016 closing price.

KW Series Loudspeakers






QSCLive SoundProductsLoudspeakersPowered LoudspeakersKW Series





KW Series
















Building on the success of our K Series, the KW Series represents the next evolutionary step in wood enclosure loudspeakers. Our system engineers have created the KW Series to feature all the groundbreaking electronic attributes of our popular K Series while at the same time designing a product that is both smaller and significantly lighter than previous wood enclosure models.









High Output


Like K Series, each of the four KW Series models features a QSC designed, 1000 watt (2 x 500 W continuous) Class D power module. And continuing in the K Series tradition, every model is fitted with the identical high-output 1.75" HF device (full-range models) and woofers of the same high quality design, regardless of speaker size.




Defined Coverage Area


Directivity Matched Transition (DMT™) provides for matched LF and HF coverage across the entire listening area, eliminating unnatural "dead" or "hot" frequency zones.




DSP


Extensive signal processing is employed throughout, providing levels of sonic clarity and total output that defy all expectations for a product in this category: Intrinsic Correction™, first featured in our high-end line array products maps 65-75 spatially-averaged measurements to IIR and FIR filters that actively adjust time, frequency and amplitude response to a maximally flat bandpass target. The result is a speaker that behaves equally well across the entire sound field. DEEP™ and excursion limiting allow for extended low-frequency response by actively managing low-frequency transients without degradation of the underlying signal or adjacent frequencies. GuardRail™ protection, first introduced on our GX Series amplifiers protects both the amplifier module and your performance from unnatural and destructive clipping. 




Connectivity


KW Series features a four-position mic / line gain switch that allows for connection of a wide variety of devices. Combo XLR and 1/4" TRS inputs accept both mic and line level input while a set of RCA phono inputs (except KW181) allow additional connectivity to portable MP3 players, CD players and line-level mixers. Up to three audio sources can be mixed internally and summed to a balanced output for "daisy-chaining" of multiple units. Separate direct outputs are also provided on each channel for additional output flexibility.







Control


On-board switches provide preset EQ settings. The HF setting (full-range models) can be set to VOCAL BOOST for additional presence in the critical mid-frequency area or FLAT for accurate reproduction of the incoming signal. The LF switch can be set to NORM, DEEP™ for additional bass extension, or EXT SUB (full-range models) for use with an external subwoofer. The rear panel LED switch can be set to POWER, illuminating the front-mounted LED when the unit is powered on, OFF for applications where it is not desirable to illuminate the front LED, or LIMIT which indicates to the system operator that the clip limiter circuit has been engaged during operation.




Tilt-Direct™


The KW122 and KW152 feature a unique Tilt-Direct™ pole cup mounting system. A simple turn of the dial engages a 7.5 degree downward tilt of the speaker allowing acoustic energy to be kept on the audience and off reflective surfaces for applications where maximum coverage from a high-positioned speaker is desired.




Remote Gain


Remote gain control capability is offered via a potentiometer (not included) connected to the on-board Phoenix-Style connector. In an installed application, multiple KW Series speakers can be "daisy-chained" for total gain control from a single remote pot. Auto-standby mode is engaged after 5 minutes of inactivity.




Premium-grade materials


KW Series is designed to withstand the rigors of professional use. Advanced construction processes, premium-grade Baltic birch cabinetry, ergonomic, cast aluminum handles, low-noise casters (KW181) and a highly protective steel grille provide for ease of transport and long term durability. Integrated M10 suspension points allow for flown applications with a KW M10 KIT (sold separately) and a threaded pole receptacle (KW181) provides for a positive, wobble free connection to a threaded speaker pole (included).

Fashion jewelry is an affordable alternative to your favorite pieces of designer jewelry. Sellers on eBay offer a variety of trendy styles that belong in your jewelry box. Make your favorite dress feel brand new again with a chic set of matching jewelry.  
A Rainbow of Colors Fashion jewelry comes in a variety of gorgeous hues, ensuring you find the perfect piece for your outfit. If you love to wear pearls, consider a pink or black pearl necklace for a fantastic twist on this classic piece of jewelry. When you just can't decide what color to pick, opt for a multi color bracelet decorated with glittering reproductions of your favorite gemstones. You have multiple options when it comes to the setting for your jewelry. Gold tones are a top setting for a traditional look, while solid black lends a contemporary finish.  
Pick Your Style Whether you prefer classic, elegant jewelry or edgy pieces, sellers on eBay have the style you are looking for. Necklaces and pendants come in a variety of designs, from the simple, yet charming locket to the clunky choker adorned with skeletons. For formal occasions, you can't go wrong with a set of exquisite choose from sets with matching pendants and necklaces, or select a more comprehensive jewelry set that also comes with a matching bracelet and ring.  
Jewelry for Every Budget Though fashion jewelry is a budget conscious alternative to fine jewelry, you can customize the price point even more so to ensure it suits your shopping budget. If you are looking for quality earrings or necklaces, Swarovski crystal jewelry offers a plethora of beautiful items that last for years. Swarovski crystals come in practically every color imaginable. What better way to accessorize an outfit with neutral colors than with a sapphire blue crystal necklace or a brooch lush with deep red crystals.
