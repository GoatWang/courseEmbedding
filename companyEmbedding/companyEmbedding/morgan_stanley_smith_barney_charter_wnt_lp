FACTORS INFLUENCING MONTHLY TRADING LOSSES: 
..  In the global stock index markets, losses were incurred from long positions 
in U.S. and European equity index futures as prices reversed lower earlier
in the month due to the release of disappointing U.S. employment data.    
Prices were also negatively impacted by surging energy prices and new     
warnings concerning potential terrorist attacks. Further losses were      
  recorded from newly established short positions towards the end of the month
as U.S. equity prices reversed higher due to the better-than-expected     
consumer confidence report and European equity prices increased due to the
release of strong earnings in Great Britain, France, and Germany.         

..  Within the global interest rate markets, short positions in U.S. and        
European bond futures incurred losses early in the month as prices moved  
higher after the release of the previously mentioned disappointing U.S.   
unemployment data for June. Additional losses were incurred later in July 
 from newly established long positions in these markets when prices reversed
lower after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's upbeat assessment of
the U.S. economy during his testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking      
Committee.

..  In the metals markets, losses were incurred from short positions in copper  
 as prices moved higher early in July due to speculation of increased demand
  and reduced supply from Mexico, one of the world's top producers. Additional
losses were incurred from long positions in nickel and zinc futures as    
  prices reversed lower due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and weak demand
from China.                                                               

FACTORS INFLUENCING MONTHLY TRADING GAINS: 
..  Within the energy markets, gains were recorded from long futures positions  
  in crude oil as prices continued to strengthen, reaching historical highs by
  month-end. Throughout the month concerns that potential terrorist attacks in
Saudi Arabia and Iraq could significantly affect global supply and        
 distribution pushed prices higher. Towards the end of the month prices were
  pressured higher by concerns that top Russian oil producer, Yukos, may break
up or stop selling oil due to government orders. Additionally, prices were
lifted further by anxiety regarding OPEC's ability to cover any shortfall 
should Yukos stop production.

oil producer Yukos, combined to push prices to record levels.             

..  Within the agricultural markets, short futures positions in corn generated  
  gains as prices trended lower due to ideal weather conditions in the growing
region of the U.S. midwest, reports of increased inventories by the U.S.  
Department of Agriculture and weak export demand. Additional gains were   
recorded from short positions in cotton futures as prices weakened due to 
reports of decreased exports.

require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported   
amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures. Management         
believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the financial        
statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from those   
estimates.                                                                      

REVENUE RECOGNITION.  Futures interests are open commitments until settlement   
date. They are valued at market on a daily basis and the resulting net change   
in unrealized gains and losses is reflected in the change in unrealized trading 
profit (loss) on open contracts from one period to the next in the Statements   
of Operations. Monthly, Morgan Stanley DW credits each Partnership with         
interest income on 100% of its average daily funds held at Morgan Stanley DW.   
In addition, Morgan Stanley DW credits each Partnership with 100% of the        
interest income Morgan Stanley DW receives from MS & Co. and MSIL with respect  
to such Partnership's assets deposited as margin. The interest rates used are   
equal to that earned by Morgan Stanley DW on its U.S. Treasury bill             
investments. For purposes of such interest payments, Net Assets do not include  
monies owed to the Partnerships on forward contracts and other futures          
interests.                                                                      

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER UNIT.  Net income (loss) per unit of limited partnership  
interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the weighted average number of Units     
outstanding during the period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
(continued)                                                                     

BROKERAGE AND RELATED TRANSACTION FEES AND COSTS.  Each Partnership pays a      
flat-rate monthly brokerage fee of  1/12 of 6.25% of the Partnership's Net      
Assets as of the first day of each month (a 6.25% annual rate). Such fees       
currently cover all brokerage commissions, transaction fees and costs, and      
ordinary administrative and offering expenses.                                  

OPERATING EXPENSES.  Each Partnership incurs monthly management fees and may    
incur incentive fees. All common administrative and continuing offering         
expenses including legal, auditing, accounting, filing fees, and other related  
expenses are borne by Morgan Stanley DW through the brokerage fees paid by      
the Partnerships.                                                               

INCOME TAXES.  No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying  
financial statements, as partners are individually responsible for reporting    
income or loss based upon their respective share of each Partnership's revenues 
and expenses for income tax purposes.                                           

DISTRIBUTIONS.  Distributions, other than redemptions of Units, are made on a   
pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of Demeter. No distributions have been    
made to date.                                                                   

CONTINUING OFFERING.  Units of each Partnership are offered at a price equal to 
100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit at monthly closings held as of the last    
day of each month. No selling commissions or charges related to the continuing  
offering of Units are paid by the limited partners or the Partnerships. Morgan  
Stanley DW pays all such costs.

REDEMPTIONS.  Limited partners may redeem some or all of their Units as of the  
last day of the sixth month following the closing at which a person first       
becomes a limited partner. Redemptions may only be made in whole Units, with a  
minimum of 100 Units required for each redemption, unless a limited partner is  
redeeming his entire interest in a particular Partnership.                      
 Units redeemed on or prior to the last day of the twelfth month from the date
of purchase will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 2% of the Net Asset 
Value of a Unit on the Redemption Date. Units redeemed after the last day of    
the twelfth month and on/or prior to the last day of the twenty-fourth month    
from the date of purchase will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 1% of 
the Net Asset Value of a Unit on the Redemption Date. Units redeemed after the  
last day of the twenty-fourth month from the date of purchase will not be       
subject to a redemption charge. The foregoing redemption charges are paid to    
Morgan Stanley DW.                                                              

EXCHANGES.  On the last day of the first month which occurs more than six       
months after a person first becomes a limited partner in any of the             
Partnerships, and at the end of each month thereafter, limited partners may     
transfer their investment among the Partnerships (subject to certain            
restrictions outlined in the Limited Partnership Agreements) without paying     
additional charges.                                                             

DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTNERSHIPS.  Charter MSFCM will terminate on December 31,
2025 and Charter Campbell, Charter Graham, and Charter Millburn will terminate  
on December 31, 2035 or at an earlier date if certain conditions occur as       
defined in each Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
(concluded)                                                                     

Compensation to the trading advisors by the Partnerships consists of a          
management fee and an incentive fee as follows:                                 

MANAGEMENT FEE.  Charter MSFCM, Charter Graham and Charter Millburn each pays   
its trading advisor a flat-rate monthly fee equal to  1/12 of 2% (a 2% annual   
rate) of the Partnership's Net Assets under management by each trading advisor  
as of the first day of each month.                                              
Charter Campbell pays its trading advisor a flat-rate monthly fee equal to  
1/12 of 2.65% (a 2.65% annual rate) of the Partnership's Net Assets under       
management as of the first day of each month.                                   

INCENTIVE FEE.  Each Partnership's incentive fee is equal to 20% of trading     
profits, paid on a quarterly basis for Charter MSFCM, and paid on a monthly     
basis for Charter Campbell, Charter Graham, and Charter Millburn.               
 Trading profits represent the amount by which profits from futures, forwards,
and options trading exceed losses after brokerage and management fees are       
deducted. When a trading advisor experiences losses with respect to Net Assets  
as of the end of a calendar month, or calendar quarter with respect to Charter  
MSFCM, the trading advisor must recover such losses before that trading advisor 
is eligible for an incentive fee in the future.
