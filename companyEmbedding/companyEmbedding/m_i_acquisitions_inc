(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received as loans from our insiders described below. These funds will be
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    a deferred underwriting commission payable to the underwriters in an amount
    equal to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering described
    below. We will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to
    consummate our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that
    we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 18
    months, we may extend the period of time to consummate a business
    combination up to three times, each by an additional month (for a total of
    up to 21 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms
    of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and the trust
    agreement to be entered into between us and American Stock Transfer & Trust
    Company, LLC on the date of this prospectus, in order to extend the time
    available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our
    insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice
    prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account
    $125,000, or $143,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full ($0.025 per unit in either case), up to an aggregate of
    $375,000 (or $431,250 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full), or $0.075 per unit, on or prior to the date of the
    applicable deadline, for each one month extension.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    approximately $525,000 even if the over-allotment option is exercised.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our
    intended use of proceeds. 

Our insiders (and/or their designees) have committed that they will purchase the
private units (for an aggregate purchase price of $4,025,000) from us on a
private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering.
Our insiders have also agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by
the underwriters in full or in part, they (and/or their designees) will purchase
from us at a price of $10.00 per unit the number of private units (up to a
maximum of 45,000 private units) that is necessary to maintain in the trust
account an amount equal to $10.30 per share of common stock sold to the public
in this offering. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

$51,500,000, or $59,225,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at JP Morgan Chase, maintained by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee. The funds held in the
trust account will be invested only in United States government treasury bills,
bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations,
the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our
initial business combination to the extent not used to pay converting
stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Magna Management LLC, a company owned by our insiders, of a
monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. However, pursuant to the terms
of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination
by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to
pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with our initial business
combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and
payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business
combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by Magna Management LLC for our
benefit. We believe that the fee charged by Magna Management LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination
or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than
the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s fees,
consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our insiders,
members of our management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our
initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $525,000.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to the underwriters in an amount equal
to 2% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon consummation of
our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of June 30, 2016, M SPAC LLC, an entity controlled by Joshua Sason, our Chief
Executive Officer, had loaned to us $131,720 to be used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses. In
addition, an unrelated party had loaned to us $55,000 to cover expenses related
to this offering. The loans are payable without interest on the earlier of (i)
the consummation of the Proposed Public Offering or (ii) the date on which the
Company determines not to proceed with the Proposed Public Offering.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for up to the next 21 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $200,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to
so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business
combination. If we do not complete a business combination, any loans and
advances from our insiders, officers and directors or their affiliates, will be
repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could complete a business combination with
utilizing the net proceeds of this offering, our ability to compete in
completing a business combination with certain sizable target businesses may be
limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

• our obligation to seek stockholder approval of our initial business
  combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a
  transaction;

• our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public
  stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business
  combination;

• our outstanding warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future
  dilution they represent;

• our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commission to the underwriters
  upon consummation of our initial business combination;

• our obligation to either repay working capital loans that may be made to us by
  our insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates;

• our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the
  private units (and underlying securities) and any shares issued to our
  insiders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working
  capital loans; and

• the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities
  under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us
  prior to the consummation of a business combination.

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however,
that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States
public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held
entities having a similar business objective as ours in connection with an
initial business combination with a target business with significant growth
potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in
all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business.
Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or
ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on
April 23, 2015. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar business combination, which we refer to


 throughout this prospectus
as our initial business combination, with one or more businesses or entities,
which we refer to throughout this prospectus as a target business. To date, our
efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities
related to this offering. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business
will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we
intend to focus our search on target businesses operating in the technology,
media and telecommunications industries. We have not selected any target
business for our initial business combination and we have not (nor has anyone on
our behalf), directly or indirectly, engaged in any substantive discussions with
a target business with respect to a business combination transaction with us.

Our executive officers and directors have extensive experience in technology,
media and telecommunications industries as managers, principals, advisors or
directors of companies operating in those industries. In addition, our
management has longstanding relationships and affiliations with key companies
operating in our target industries, including Sony Entertainment, Miramax Films,
Dimension Films, Open Roads Films, Columbia Records, and London Records
(acquired by Universal Music Group). They also have extensive experience in
identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on companies targeted
for acquisition and consummating acquisitions in the technology, media and
telecommunications industries. Prior to the consummation of our initial business
combination, we will seek to capitalize on management’s experience in the
technology, media and telecommunications industries. Led by our Chief Executive
Officer, Joshua Sason, we believe that we are in a position to bring substantial
value to any relevant potential target company. Joshua Sason, through Magna
Entertainment, has produced four feature films, including the latest feature
film, “Bleed for This”, which was a collaboration with Open Road Films in the
United States and Sony Entertainment internationally that launched marketing in
July and is scheduled for release in late 2016.

Our management team, however, does not have prior experience in pursuing
acquisitions on behalf of blank check companies and past performance by our
management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to locating a target
business to acquire.

Subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination, we believe
that the strengths of our management team, particularly their extensive
operations experience in the technology, media and telecommunications
industries, will be valuable to any business in the technology, media and
telecommunications industry with which we consummate our initial business
combination, although the specific roles, if any, they may have following our
initial business combination cannot be determined at this time.

We will have until 18 months from the closing of this offering to consummate our
initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able
to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months, we may extend
the period of time to consummate a business combination up to three times, each
by an additional month (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business
combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated articles of
incorporation and the trust agreement to be entered into between us and American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC on the date of this prospectus, in order to
extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination,
our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice
prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $125,000,
or $143,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full
($0.025 per unit in either case), up to an aggregate of $375,000 (or $431,250 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), or $0.075 per
unit, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each one month
extension. The insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured
promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid
in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are
funds available outside the trust account to do so. In the event that we receive
notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their
intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing
such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In
addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable
deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our
insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust
account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination.
To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the
period of time to consummate our initial business combinations, such insiders
(or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire $375,000 (or
$431,250). If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination
within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten
business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro
rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata
portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not
previously released to us for tax purposes or necessary to pay our taxes, and
then seek to dissolve and liquidate. However, we may not be able to distribute
such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the
claims of our public stockholders. In the event of our dissolution and
liquidation, the public warrants will expire and will be worthless.

We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination
at a meeting called for such purpose, at which stockholders may seek to convert
their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed
business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on
deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our
stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a
tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount
equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the
trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations
described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval
of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares
to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will
be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and
whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek
stockholder approval. Any tender offer documents used in connection with a
business combination will contain substantially the same financial and other
information about the initial business combination as is required under the
SEC’s proxy rules.

The initial per public share redemption or conversion price will be $10.30 per
share, regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised. However, we
may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors
which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.

Pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, our initial business
combination must occur with one or more target businesses having an aggregate
fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding
any deferred underwriter’s fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the
trust account), which we refer to as the 80% test, at the time of the agreement
to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to
independently determine the fair market value of the target business or
businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking
firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will also obtain a
fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm before consummating
a business combination with an entity affiliated with any of our officers,
directors or insiders. If we are no longer listed on Nasdaq, we will not be
required to satisfy the 80% test.

We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the
post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or
acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or
businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such
that the post-transaction company owns less than 100% of such interests or
assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target
management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete
such business combination if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of
the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise owns a controlling
interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the
Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of
the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business
combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction
company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business
combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we
issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling
interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial
number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business
combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent
to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests
or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the
post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is
owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% test.

If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination
opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or
she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be
required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior
to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. All of our officers,
directors and director nominees currently have certain relevant pre-existing
fiduciary duties or contractual obligations.

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
Who’s ready for a wardrobe refresh? Shop men’s clothing, shoes, accessories and more at Macy’s.Looking for huge savings? Shop our Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Holiday Gift Guide!
