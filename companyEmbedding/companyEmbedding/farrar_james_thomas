Back to Surnames Page


Meaning:  (British) From Ferrier (Old French), "horse-shoer and iron worker".

The Farrar name has been pronounced several different ways.  Some pronounce it as "far' uhr".  Some pronounce it as " fuh- rahr' ".  This family pronounces it "fairer".

From the beginning, the Farrar family name has had many variations:  Ferris, Ferrer, Farrer, Ferrier, Farris, Farrar, and Faries.  All these families claim to be from the same family, and therefore must be variations of the same name.  All are descended from the deFerriers who came to England with William Conqueror in 1066, and then from the Ferris family of Leicestershire, England, descended from Henri deFerriers, son of Gwalchalme deFerriers, who was Master of Horse to the Duke of Normandy.  His name is found "upon the Battle Abbey Roll".  We do know that there was a Henry Ferriers who came with William the Conqueror to England from a town named Ferriers or Ferrieres in France.  His descendants continue to possess the estate of Baddlesley Clinton, Warwickshire, England.  The Ferriers were a distinguished family in England and France.  The surname is originally Norman and means "one who works in iron", which could have been in any country.


*****  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT SOME OF THESE EARLIER GENERATIONS MAY NOT BE CORRECT.  AS ALWAYS, ON ANYBODY'S WEB PAGES, PLEASE USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT.     WHAT I AM VERY SURE OF BEGINS WITH GENERATION #5.     ******


Descendants of George Farrar, Sr.

Generation No. 1

1.  GEORGE8 FARRAR, SR.  (WILLIAM7, WILLIAM6, WILLIAM5, JOHN4, WILLIAM3, HENRIE2, HENRY1) was born 1692 in Farrar's Island, Henrico County, Va, and died 16 Mar 1772 in St. James Parish, Mecklenburg, Va.  He married JUDITH JEFFERSON 1717 in Henrico County, Va, daughter of THOMAS JEFFERSON and VIRGINIA FIELD.  She was born 30 Aug 1698 in Monticello, Henrico County, Va, and died Nov 1786 in St. James Parish, Mecklenburg County, Va.

Notes for GEORGE FARRAR, SR.:  He and his wife owned and lived on Gilly's Mill Plantation for about 30 years.  Judith's father deeded the land to George about 1729.  It was located in the neighborhood of the Jefferson plantation.

From the beginning, the family name has had many variations:  Ferris, Ferrer, Farrer, Ferrier, Farris, Farrar, and Faries.  All these families claim to be from the same family, and therefore must be variations of the same name.  All are descended from the deFerriers who came to England with William Conqueror in 1066, and then from the Ferris family of Leicestershire, England, descended from Henri deFerriers, son of Gwalchalme deFerriers, who was Master of Horse to the Duke of Normandy.  His name is found "upon the Battle Abbey Roll".  We do know that there was a Henry Ferriers who came with William the Conqueror to England from a town named Ferriers or Ferrieres in France.  His descendants continue to possess the estate of Baddlesley Clinton, Warwickshire, England.  The Ferriers were a distinguished family in England and France.  The surname is originally Norman and means "one who works in iron", which could have been in any country.  It originates from the word "farrier", which is by definition, one who "specializes in hoof care of the horse, including trimming and balancing the hoof to fit shoes."  A farrier uses the blacksmithing skill of metal fabrication, combined with veterinary medicine and knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the horses' legs and hooves to address the care of the feet.  At one time, the farrier and blacksmith were the same.  In colonial times, the farrier would have performed horseshoeing in addition to fabrication and repair of tools, forging of architectural pieces, etc.

Notes for JUDITH JEFFERSON:  If you follow her Jefferson line, you see that she is the aunt of President Thomas Jefferson.

I am so sorry to hear of Jim's passing. It seams like yesterday hearing him tell me how my feet look like duck feet because I wore pantyhose duck hunting with Ricky. We got stuck in the mud and Jim came pulled us out. He was a proud father, grandpa. He always picked on me and was my friend. You will be missed. May you rest in peace.

Your Search returned zero good matches
Why?

            Although there may be many good matches for your ancestor in our content, we can't
            return good matches without more information.
        
What should you do?

            Add details about your ancestor - even an educated guess can increase your chances
            of getting a high-quality match.
