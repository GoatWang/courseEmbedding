History[edit]
The company was founded in 1941 in Weatherford, Texas as the Weatherford Spring Company by Jesse E. Hall Sr.[3][4] In 1948, the company was renamed Weatherford Oil Tool Company (WOTCO) with ownership by Jesse Hall, his son, Elmer, James E. Berry, and Juan A. Perea.[5] From its inception, the company pioneered an innovative technique and equipment for the cementing of cased-hole oil wells.[5] Originally marketed to U.S. well owners, Weatherford drilling and casing equipment was soon being used in the oil fields of Venezuela by the Gulf Oil Company.[5]
In 1972, the separate company of Energy Ventures, Inc. was founded as an offshore gas and oil exploration and production company.[6] In 1987, Energy Ventures was liquidated and re-established, and by 1990, had acquired Grant Oil Country Tubular Company.[7]
In 1991, Weatherford acquired Petroleum Equipment Tools Company (PETCO).[7] Weatherford and HOMCO later merged operations to create Weatherford Services, the largest oil fishing/rental company in the world. In 1995, Weatherford merged with Enterra, becoming Weatherford Enterra Inc.[7]
In May 1998 Energy Ventures, since renamed EVI, Inc. and Weatherford Enterra, Inc. merged, creating the current company now known as Weatherford.[7][8] In the next two years, Weatherford added a number of well-organized brands to its expertise, including Dailey, Orwell, Energy Rentals, Whiting, Williams, BBL and ECD Northwest. Weatherford also created a stronger completion competence with the addition of well-known brands in the sector such as Petroline, Cardium, Nodeco, McAllister, Johnson Screens, Houston Well Screens, Arrow, and CIDRA.
In 2005, Weatherford acquired Precision Drilling Corporation’s Precision Energy Services and International Contract Drilling divisions.
In July 2007, the company was featured in news media reports questioning operations of the company's foreign subsidiary, Weatherford Oil Tool Middle East, which had offices and equipment in the nation of Sudan.[9] Since 1997, U.S. companies were forbidden by law to operate in Sudan, though foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies could still legally operate in that country if there was no involvement by the U.S. parent or any other U.S. person.[10] Nevertheless, in response to media and investor criticism, the company announced that it would divest itself of any foreign subsidiary operations in countries sanctioned by the United States.[10][11][11] The next year, Weatherford withdrew from activities in Sudan and donated its in-country equipment as well as providing additional equipment, supplies, and funding to Thirst No More, a humanitarian organization operating in Sudan.[12][13]
In 2008, the company announced that it was shifting its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland.[14] That same year, Weatherford completed its acquisition of V-Tech International, a pioneer in the development of mechanical power tong systems in the North Sea to improve rig safety.[15]
In May 2010, Weatherford's Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, facility accidentally released a cloud of ammonium persulfate that resulted in the evacuation of 500 workers from the surrounding industrial park.[16] In April 2014, Weatherford announced that its board of directors approved the relocation of its legal domicile to Ireland from Switzerland. The company will continue to maintain its operational office in Houston, Texas. [17]
On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]
Company focus[edit]
As an oil and natural gas drilling services company, Weatherford produces a variety of products and services for the oil and gas industry. These include drilling services, electronic well measurement and monitoring, completion, production, and evaluation products and services. In particular, the company has developed directional drilling services that can extend through miles of bedrock with great precision, and tubular running services that are used on almost half of the world’s deepwater drilling projects. The company has more sand screen systems installed worldwide than any other company, and production optimization systems in more than 100,000 wells around the world. Weatherford also offers intervention, completion, and decommissioning services for well owners, in addition to pipeline precommissioning, commissioning operations, and one of the world's most diverse fleets of inline inspection tools.[20][21]

 * Revenues and Segment Operating Loss in the second quarter of 2017 include a $42 million reduction in revenue and operating income for the change in revenue recognition in Venezuela. Excluding this adjustment, the second quarter 2017 total results would have been $1.405 billion in Revenues and $3 million in Segment Operating Income. 


 ** Adjusted Segment Operating Loss and Margin here and elsewhere in this filing are non-GAAP measures and exclude the first quarter 2016 charges and second quarter 2016 income on the Zubair contract. 


 *** Adjusted Segment Incrementals here and elsewhere in this press release are calculated by taking the change in adjusted segment operating loss over the change in revenues. 




"We believe our industry will remain range bound within this 'medium-for-longer' price level for some time, until production growth is moderated. In the interim, we expect continuous short-term cyclical fluctuations. Adapting to this likely new paradigm, our industry must transform itself. We will continue to push innovation, both from a technical and a business model perspective, and we will deliver operational excellence to bring the cost of production down to a point at which all participants can make a decent return.
To improve our position and drive better results, there are plenty of things well within our ability to execute. We will accelerate our mission to become a more focused and efficient company, and we are committed to a path of greater profitability, reliability and consistency within our organization. Ensuring flawless execution, discipline and accountability will be at the center of what we do. As we move forward toward reliable and sustainable performance, Weatherford will achieve new levels of success for our employees, customers and shareholders."
Second Quarter 2017 Results
Revenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.36 billion compared with $1.39 billion in the first quarter of 2017, or a 2% decrease, and was 3% lower than the $1.40 billion of revenue reported in the second quarter of 2016. Sequentially, North America revenue decreased 3% due to the seasonal slowdown in Canada, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. International revenue declined 2% sequentially, led by a previously disclosed change in accounting for revenue in Venezuela, which was almost entirely offset by improved results and activity in the Middle East and Russia. Land Drilling Rigs revenue improved 13% sequentially.
During the second quarter, Weatherford determined that the expected duration to collect revenue from its largest customer in Venezuela significantly exceeded the contractual payment terms and represents an implied financing arrangement. Accordingly, the Company modified its revenue recognition with this customer in the second quarter to record a discount reflecting the time value of money and accreting the discount as interest income over the expected collection period using the effective interest method. The impact of this change on the second quarter reduced revenue and increased operating loss by $42 million and reduced net income by $35 million  ($0.04 diluted net loss per share). Absent this adjustment, sequential revenue improved 1% and International revenue improved 3%. 
Net loss for the second quarter of 2017 was $171 million (diluted net loss of $0.17 per share), compared to a $448 million loss in the first quarter of 2017 (diluted net loss of $0.45 per share), and a $565 million loss in the second quarter of the prior year (diluted net loss of $0.63 per share). 
Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter of 2017 was $282 million (non-GAAP diluted net loss of $0.28 per share), compared to a non-GAAP $318 million loss in the first quarter of 2017 (non-GAAP diluted net loss of $0.32 per share) and a non-GAAP $253 million loss in the second quarter of the prior year (non-GAAP diluted net loss of $0.28 per share). Excluding the impact of the Venezuela revenue recognition adjustment, non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the second quarter was $0.24 per share.
Non-GAAP adjustments, net of tax, of $111 million of income for the second quarter include:

$127 million in income related to the fair value adjustment of the outstanding warrant; 
$29 million in severance and restructuring charges; and 
$13 million of income from other charges and credits.

Segment operating margins improved 95 basis points sequentially and 400 basis points excluding the impact of the change in Venezuela revenue recognition due to activity increases in the U.S., Middle East and Russia. On a product line basis, Artificial Lift, Reservoir Solutions, Land Drilling Rigs and Drilling Services drove the margin improvements. Year-on-year segment operating margin improved 185 basis points due to reduced operating expenses from the shutdown of Pressure Pumping operations in North America, realization of savings from cost reduction measures, and increased activity in the U.S. and Russia. Excluding the second quarter 2016 income on the Zubair contract, adjusted segment operating margin improved 548 basis points.
Cash Flow and Financial Covenants
Net cash used in operating activities was $62 million for the second quarter of 2017, including $107 million of debt interest payments, $40 million of cash severance and restructuring costs, and $30 million of SEC legal settlement costs, partially offset by $93 million of positive cash inflows from collection of other receivables, insurance proceeds and favorable legal settlements. Capital expenditures of $42 million increased slightly by $2 million or 5% sequentially, and increased $11 million or 35% from the same quarter in the prior year. We remain in compliance with our financial covenants as defined in our revolving and secured term loan credit facilities as of June 30, 2017. Based on our current financial projections, we believe we will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants for the remainder of 2017.
Technology Highlights
Weatherford announced the commercial release of the following technologies during the quarter:

The ForeSite™ production optimization platform combines physics-based models with advanced data analytics to improve performance across wells, reservoirs and surface facilities. This release is the first in a series of integrated software offerings that will combine proven Weatherford production optimization technologies with the Internet of Things, cloud computing and advanced analytics to enable complete asset management. 
The Raptor™ 2.0 cased-hole evaluation system, which has been tested and proven in more than 200 field runs, combines a pulsed-neutron wireline logging device with advanced petrophysical workflows. The system provides enhanced actionable reservoir data and enables operators to identify and quantify reserves in conventional and tight-gas reservoirs during completion, production and rejuvenation operations. 
A premium version of the RipTide® RFID drilling reamer incorporates advanced cutter technology developed through collaborative efforts between Weatherford and US Synthetic, a leading provider of polycrystalline diamond cutters for the oil and gas industry. As part of the collaborative project, Weatherford developed the ReamSync™ borehole enlargement performance system, which includes a predictive cutter and formation interaction software used in the design of cutter blocks. 
The WFX0 system is the industry's first fully integrated gravel-pack system to achieve an API/ISO V0 rating, which validates that it has been tested to the industry's highest standards with zero gas leakage. By leveraging several V0-rated Weatherford technologies including the TerraForm® packer, the system enables gravel-pack completion of multiple openhole zones in a single trip and achieves cased-hole functionality in an openhole environment.

Second quarter revenues of $475 million were down $15 million or 3% sequentially, and up $74 million, or 18%, over the same period last year. Sequential revenues decreased primarily due to the seasonal spring break-up in Canada offset by an increase in revenue across all product lines in the U.S. as a result of the increased drilling and completion activity. Excluding the impact of the U.S. Pressure Pumping operations that shut down during the fourth quarter 2016, year-on-year revenues improved 37%. 
Second quarter segment operating income of $2 million (0.5% margin) improved by $20 million sequentially from a loss of $18 million (-3.7% margin). Sequential margin improvement was driven by a lower cost structure in the U.S. associated with a favorable product mix and partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in Canada. Compared to the same period last year, second quarter segment operating income improved by $103 million or 103% due to increased activity levels, a significantly lower loss in Pressure Pumping following the shut-down of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the realization of significant savings from cost cutting measures taken over the past quarters. 
Operational highlights in North America during the second quarter include:

In the Permian Basin, Weatherford is increasingly installing Rotaflex® long-stroke pumping units as an alternative to or replacement for electric submersible pump (ESP) systems. Rotaflex units are especially well suited to unconventional applications, have a much longer run life and can reduce energy costs by 30% to 50% compared to ESP systems. 
Contracts for Artificial Lift systems remained strong in Western Canada. In addition to the contract for more than 40 pumping units reported in Q1, Weatherford was awarded 76 more units to be deployed in the second half of 2017. 
The new Raptor™ 2.0 cased-hole evaluation system was deployed to assess the remaining production potential of three shut-in unconventional wells in Western Canada. Data from the Raptor 2.0 system identified untapped oil- and gas-producing zones in two of the three wells. Using this data, the operator has established initial production and is planning additional recompletion campaigns in the reservoir.

 * Revenues and Segment Operating Loss in the second quarter of 2017 include a $42 million reduction in revenue and operating income for the change in revenue recognition in Venezuela. Excluding this adjustment, the second quarter 2017 International results would have been $829 million in Revenues and $21 million in Segment Operating Income. 


 ** Adjusted Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Margin here and elsewhere in this filing are non-GAAP measures and exclude the first quarter 2016 charges and second quarter 2016 income on the Zubair contract. 




Second quarter revenues of $787 million were down 2% sequentially and down 12% year-on-year. Second quarter segment operating loss of $21 million (-2.6% margin) deteriorated $17 million from an operating loss of $4 million (-0.5% margin) in the prior quarter. Second quarter operating loss deteriorated $73 million year-on-year, and second quarter adjusted segment operating loss, which excluded the effect from the Zubair contract in 2016, deteriorated by $23 million year-on-year. 

Latin America

Second quarter revenues of $203 million were down $39 million, or 16% sequentially, and down $46 million, or 18% compared to the same quarter last year. Second quarter operating loss of $35 million (-16.9% margin) was down $44 million sequentially from operating income of $9 million (3.8% margin) and down  $36 million from operating income of $1 million (0.6% margin) compared to the same period last year. 
The sequential and year-on-year declines in second quarter revenues and operating income were almost entirely due to the $42 million change in our accounting for revenue in Venezuela. Excluding this negative impact, second quarter revenues of $245 million were up $3 million, or 1% sequentially, and down $4 million, or 2% compared to the same quarter last year, and second quarter operating income of $7 million (2.9% margin) was down $2 million sequentially, and up $6 million compared to the same period last year. Sequentially, the improvements in revenue were primarily driven by activity increases in Argentina.
Operational highlights in Latin America during the second quarter include:

In a shallow-water integrated services project in the Gulf of Mexico, Weatherford set a new field record in the first well by drilling a directional offshore well to total depth 7 days faster than the previous field record. 
Weatherford was awarded a 5-year contract for the provision of Pressure Pumping services in Chile, with a total value of over $150 million. 
In Colombia, Weatherford won a contract with a major customer for solids control and waste management services in drilling and completion operations. Work is expected to start in August. 
In Argentina, Weatherford won two sizable contracts for hydraulic fracturing services that will increase the utilization of existing pressure pumping fleets in the country and will create further opportunities to provide integrated completions services to the unconventional Argentina market.

 

Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia

Second quarter revenues of $244 million were flat sequentially and compared to the same quarter last year. Second quarter operating income of $5 million (2.0% margin) increased from operating loss of $10 million (-4.1% margin) sequentially, and increased from operating income of $1 million (0.3% margin) year-on-year. Sequential revenues remained steady due to recovery from the seasonal decline in Russia, partially offset by a decrease in Secure Drilling product sales in Europe while activity in Sub-Sahara Africa remained flat in a challenged market. Operating income improved primarily on the higher activity in Russia and further cost reduction measures in Sub-Sahara Africa.
Operational highlights in Europe/Sub-Sahara Africa/Russia during the second quarter include:

After demonstrating high levels of service quality and efficiency on a one-well project in the North Sea, Weatherford replaced the incumbent on a 5-year, logging-while-drilling contract with options for extension. 
Weatherford and Gazprom Neft signed a technology cooperation agreement at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. The agreement is valid for five years and is intended to further develop current business relationships and collaborations between the two companies. Under the signed document, the parties agree to exchange operational and technological information for analysis, with the aim of identifying innovative solutions that will improve the efficiency and operational performance of both companies.

 

Middle East/North Africa/Asia Pacific

Second quarter revenues of $340 million were up 6% sequentially and down 15% from the same quarter in the prior year. Excluding the revenue related to the Zubair contract, second quarter revenue of $331 million was up 4% sequentially and flat compared to the same period last year. Second quarter segment operating income of $9 million (2.8% margin) improved from an operating loss of $3 million (-1.1% margin) in the prior quarter and deteriorated from an operating income of $50 million (12.5% margin) year-on-year. Excluding the income on the Zubair contract, second quarter 2016 adjusted segment operating income was nil (-0.1% margin), resulting in a year-on-year increase of $9 million compared to the current quarter adjusted segment operating income of $9 million (2.8% margin). The increase in sequential revenue and operating results was primarily due to higher activity in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Thailand.
Operational highlights in the Middle East/North Africa/Asia Pacific during the second quarter include:

Weatherford won a turnkey project related to rigless well testing operations and mobilized operations in June 2017. In addition Weatherford was invited to participate in large turnkey well construction projects for a major Middle Eastern NOC. 
Using technologies such as the Revolution® rotary-steerable system (RSS), the hostile-environment-logging (HEL) system and logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools, Weatherford delivered record-setting Directional Drilling results in five different wells for an operator in the Middle East. In one well, Weatherford achieved a rate of penetration 80% higher than the field average. 
In a Gulf Cooperation Council country, Weatherford provided complete characterization of a challenging well in a prolific field. By deploying Compact™ logging and formation testing tools on drillpipe, Weatherford saved the operator approximately 60 hours of rig time compared to conventional pipe-conveyed logging operations. The Compact tools acquired high-quality nuclear, gamma, dual-neutron and array-induction logs, as well as more than 25 pressure points throughout the formation.

 Land Drilling Rigs
Second quarter revenues of $101 million were up $12 million, or 13% sequentially and down $8 million, or 7% compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Second quarter operating loss of $20 million (-20.7% margin) improved sequentially by $10 million from an operating loss of $30 million (-33.3% margin) and deteriorated year-on-year by $3 million from an operating loss of $17 million (-15.7%). The sequential improvement in revenues and operating results was due to improved operational efficiency, and from Algeria and Kuwait being fully operational during the quarter. During the second quarter of 2017, the Land Drilling Rigs segment returned to positive EBITDA (segment operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) with improved rig utilization and lower cost structure. The structural changes to operational processes and efficiencies implemented in the first half of this year, as well as potential opportunities to restart operations in multiple geographies should allow for continued improvement and sustained returns throughout the second half of 2017 and beyond.
Operational highlights in the Land Drilling Rigs business during the second quarter include:

Weatherford Land Drilling Rigs achieved zero lost-time incidents globally in Q2 2017. The business also celebrated safety milestones on a number of individual rigs, including 16 years without a lost-time incident on a rig in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, Weatherford rig operations in Oman and Kuwait received ISO 9001 certification in recognition of quality management systems. 
Weatherford won a 2-year contract for a major NOC with the option to extend for one more year for two 1,500 HP drilling rigs. Over the initial 2-year period the total contract value is estimated at $72 million and the 1-year extension is valued at $35 million. 
An operator in Algeria recognized Weatherford Land Drilling Rigs for achieving a new drilling record. The team reached a total depth of 2,150 meters in 20 days, more than 9 days ahead of plan.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1941 in Weatherford, Texas as the Weatherford Spring Company by Jesse E. Hall Sr.[3][4] In 1948, the company was renamed Weatherford Oil Tool Company (WOTCO) with ownership by Jesse Hall, his son, Elmer, James E. Berry, and Juan A. Perea.[5] From its inception, the company pioneered an innovative technique and equipment for the cementing of cased-hole oil wells.[5] Originally marketed to U.S. well owners, Weatherford drilling and casing equipment was soon being used in the oil fields of Venezuela by the Gulf Oil Company.[5]
In 1972, the separate company of Energy Ventures, Inc. was founded as an offshore gas and oil exploration and production company.[6] In 1987, Energy Ventures was liquidated and re-established, and by 1990, had acquired Grant Oil Country Tubular Company.[7]
In 1991, Weatherford acquired Petroleum Equipment Tools Company (PETCO).[7] Weatherford and HOMCO later merged operations to create Weatherford Services, the largest oil fishing/rental company in the world. In 1995, Weatherford merged with Enterra, becoming Weatherford Enterra Inc.[7]
In May 1998 Energy Ventures, since renamed EVI, Inc. and Weatherford Enterra, Inc. merged, creating the current company now known as Weatherford.[7][8] In the next two years, Weatherford added a number of well-organized brands to its expertise, including Dailey, Orwell, Energy Rentals, Whiting, Williams, BBL and ECD Northwest. Weatherford also created a stronger completion competence with the addition of well-known brands in the sector such as Petroline, Cardium, Nodeco, McAllister, Johnson Screens, Houston Well Screens, Arrow, and CIDRA.
In 2005, Weatherford acquired Precision Drilling Corporation’s Precision Energy Services and International Contract Drilling divisions.
In July 2007, the company was featured in news media reports questioning operations of the company's foreign subsidiary, Weatherford Oil Tool Middle East, which had offices and equipment in the nation of Sudan.[9] Since 1997, U.S. companies were forbidden by law to operate in Sudan, though foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies could still legally operate in that country if there was no involvement by the U.S. parent or any other U.S. person.[10] Nevertheless, in response to media and investor criticism, the company announced that it would divest itself of any foreign subsidiary operations in countries sanctioned by the United States.[10][11][11] The next year, Weatherford withdrew from activities in Sudan and donated its in-country equipment as well as providing additional equipment, supplies, and funding to Thirst No More, a humanitarian organization operating in Sudan.[12][13]
In 2008, the company announced that it was shifting its place of incorporation from Bermuda to Switzerland.[14] That same year, Weatherford completed its acquisition of V-Tech International, a pioneer in the development of mechanical power tong systems in the North Sea to improve rig safety.[15]
In May 2010, Weatherford's Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, facility accidentally released a cloud of ammonium persulfate that resulted in the evacuation of 500 workers from the surrounding industrial park.[16] In April 2014, Weatherford announced that its board of directors approved the relocation of its legal domicile to Ireland from Switzerland. The company will continue to maintain its operational office in Houston, Texas. [17]
On November 9, 2016, Weatherford announced the departure of Bernard J. Duroc-Danner, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO. It also announced the appointment of Robert Rayne as Chairman of the Board and Krishna Shivram as Chief Executive Officer.[18]
On March 6, 2017, Weatherford announced the appointment of Mark A. McCollum as President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Weatherford. In addition, the Company announced that Mr. William E. Macaulay has been appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors.[19]

Schlumberger and Weatherford to Form OneStim Joint Venture
New company targets North America unconventional resource development
HOUSTON, March 24, 2017—Schlumberger and Weatherford today announced an agreement to create OneStimSM, a joint venture to deliver completions products and services for the development of unconventional resource plays in the United States and Canada land markets. The joint venture will offer one of the broadest multistage completions portfolios in the market combined with one of the largest hydraulic fracturing fleets in the industry.
Weatherford will contribute its leading multistage completions portfolio, cost-effective regional manufacturing capability, and supply chain. Schlumberger will provide the joint venture with access to its industry-leading surface and downhole technologies, efficient operational processes and advanced geo-engineered workflows. 
Schlumberger and Weatherford will have 70/30 ownership of the joint venture, respectively. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2017, and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Under the terms of the formation agreement, Schlumberger and Weatherford will contribute all their respective North America land hydraulic fracturing pressure pumping assets, multistage completions, and pump-down perforating businesses. Weatherford will also receive a one-time $535 million cash payment from Schlumberger.
Schlumberger will manage the joint venture and consolidate it for financial reporting purposes.
Schlumberger Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard commented, “The joint-venture creates a new industry leader in terms of hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions technologies in North America land, which through its scale offers a cost-effective and highly competitive service delivery platform. OneStimSM is uniquely positioned to provide customers with leading operational efficiency and best-in-class hydraulic fracturing and completions technologies, while at the same time significantly improving full-cycle shareholder returns from this market.”
Weatherford Chairman William E. Macaulay said, “The OneStimSM joint venture creates a leading unconventional products and services provider in North America land. This transaction will allow Weatherford to deleverage its balance sheet while retaining a significant exposure to the unconventional market. This transaction was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors and will create significant value for both parties.”

Weatherford International Press Release
WEATHERFORD AND CURTRAN SIGN LONG-TERM CONTRACT FOR NEW LITEWIRE™  NANOTECHNOLOGY 
Weatherford Gains Exclusivity of Nanotube Wire and Cable Products in the Oil and Gas Industry
HOUSTON – April 08, 2014 – Weatherford International Ltd. today announced that it has entered into an agreement with CurTran LLC to use, sell, and distribute LiteWire, the first commercial scale production of a carbon nanotube technology in wire and cable form. 
“With LiteWire products, we gain exclusivity to a revolutionary technology that will greatly add value to our business,” said Dharmesh Mehta, chief operating officer for Weatherford. “The use of LiteWire products allows us to provide safer, faster, and more economic solutions for our customers.”
In addition to using LiteWire in its global operations, Weatherford will be the exclusive distributor of this product in the oil and gas industry. 
“Weatherford is an ideal first customer for LiteWire because the oil and gas industry is the most demanding arena for any cable product,” said Gary Rome, chief executive officer and president of CurTran. “It is a long-term contract with a forecasted average value of more than $350 million per year.”
 
CurTran manufactures LiteWire, carbon nanotube conductors in wire form that are now becoming available to the commercial market for the first time. LiteWire can be utilized anywhere a metallic conductor is used, and in places where metals cannot go.  
“There hasn’t been any real innovation to replace copper wire in the last hundred years until now,” added Rome. “LiteWire is a sustainable, lighter and stronger technology that combines the electrical and mechanical aspects of wire and cable into one product.”

Weatherford is one of the largest multinational oilfield services companies. Weatherford’s product and service portfolio spans the life cycle of the well, and includes capability in drilling and formation evaluation, well construction, completion and production.

Claws: All New Sundays at 9/8c | TNT


Play all


        Claws is a midnight-dark, wickedly funny meditation on female badness set in a South Florida nail salon. It follows the rise of five diverse and treacherous manicurists working at the Nail Artisan of Manatee County salon, where there is a lot more going on than silk wraps and pedicures. Claws is about good women caught in bad places with worse men. It's the story of hardworking women trying to get by in this economy, set against the surreal, bright, gritty landscape of Florida and the luscious, absurd, extreme excesses of the crime world.

Weatherford Customer Stories










PLM has enabled the world’s oil and gas-producing giants to increase their well productivity.













Design anywhere, build anywhere is an ambitious goal for any global manufacturer, but especially so for Weatherford, one of the world's largest providers of oilfield equipment and services.
"Wherever there is oil, Weatherford is represented," says Bill Droke, an IT director responsible for the company's integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) and product lifecycle management (PLM) systems. Weatherford is a multi-national organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland with operations in over 100 countries. The company operates 16 technology and training centers, approximately 1,000 service and manufacturing facilities. Over 59,000 Weatherford employees are dedicated to helping the world's oil and gas-producing giants increase their well productivity.
Oil and gas companies apply Weatherford's technology across the span of a well's lifecycle – from drilling and evaluation through completion and production. Intervention systems are another Weatherford specialty; they help oil and gas producers remedy problems and optimize yields from underperforming wells worldwide.
About a decade ago, Weatherford committed to taking the "design anywhere, build anywhere" concept from an industry ideal to a company imperative. They resolved to reorganize their operations around a global ERP platform, with integrated PLM as a mission-critical component. 
Why PLM? "Simple," says Droke. "We needed to get control over our product data. More than ever, we began to think of our parts designs as critical company assets. Our investments in ERP and PLM are entirely aimed at improving inventory and asset management throughout our global supply chain." 
Layers of complexity
From the ERP/PLM initiative's start, Weatherford set out to build a single, centralized database of their product information. They envisioned the system to be comprehensive in scope, with parts consistently identified and extensively attributed. Users should be able to access the data quickly and easily – at any time, from any place.
Given the company's worldwide operations, delivering these capabilities would be no simple task. But that was only one complicating factor. 
"Product engineering in the oilfield industry may be like nowhere else," says Lewis Lawrence, Weatherford's PLM process owner. "While there are standard products that we design and manufacture, there are critical products we provide that are specifically engineered to the well conditions they will be used in. They're designed, configured, and built to order."
Weatherford's parts – especially those for downhole uses – are generally machined from raw bar stock, and they may use materials that other industries would view as exotic. An example is inconel, a super-alloy primarily based on nickel and chromium. 
Production is limited, but a product's lifecycle may be very long. "Repeat orders are often 10 years or more apart," Lawrence says. "With designs for parts coming from so many sources, it can be easy to lose track. The original data may be hard to find."
What Weatherford has especially aimed to avoid, notes Lawrence, is the need to re-engineer parts that already exist. This adds time and cost to product development. 
Bottom-line impact
Another PLM challenge has been organizational. Over the years, Weatherford has grown through acquisitions. The firm is today a melding of more than 250 acquired companies. "And for every new engineering team we've brought on board," says Lawrence, "we've taken on another set of legacy systems for numbering and describing parts."
The supply chain adds layers of complexity. "Weatherford's biggest customer," Lawrence notes, "is Weatherford." That is, most production in the company's plants is to fulfill internal sales to their own service organization. Weatherford's service sites then rent and operate the equipment when performing services for the oil and gas companies under service contracts.
Weatherford also relies on thousands of third-party manufacturers to produce short runs of specialized parts. The company's suppliers are mostly small companies. "Many," says Lawrence, "are in way-out-of-the-way places close to our customers' wells. This makes for a lot of additional – and a lot of different – product data to coordinate."
On top of all that, delivery deadlines are tight. If Weatherford delays getting equipment to a site, the customer may waste precious drilling time and fall behind on production.
"There's a huge bottom-line impact from being on time," says Lawrence. "We can't be held up by problems with product data. For our customers, it's a matter of productivity. For us, it can be the difference between getting the next service contract – or not." 
Quality in, quality out
Weatherford uses an Oracle ERP system, with PTC's Windchill system as the PLM front end. Users create parts with computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and Weatherford's PLM-driven Release To Production (RTP) process tightly controls approvals before transferring the parts information to ERP.
Key engineering and manufacturing personnel automatically receive notification when a new or updated part design reaches "released" status. "The systems are so intertwined," says Droke, "that ERP users interact with our PLM tools and data without really knowing it."
Weatherford's ongoing acquisition of companies means that adoption of the integrated ERP/PLM systems remains a work in process. Yet there is no doubt it has firmly taken hold. There are now more than 2,000 day-to-day PLM users at Weatherford. The product database holds nearly a million part masters and over a million secondary part numbers.
Each month Weatherford users add nearly 6,000 new part numbers, nearly 2,000 part revisions, and over 1,000 engineering change requests to the system. By Droke's estimate, approximately 85% of Weatherford's business transactions now occur through the ERP/PLM systems. As he puts it: "If Windchill is unavailable, our ability to respond to business demand is severely impacted."
Quality of product data is all-important, says Lawrence. "Here's my philosophy: Live like there is no tomorrow; manage data like it will live forever." He elaborates: "I may be stating the obvious here, but the information contained in PLM is what gives the system value. Bad data is worse than no data. Inconsistent data is bad data. The system doesn't create data, nor does it fix data. Quality in, quality out."
Lawrence adds, "With apologies to the credit card commercials – good data: priceless."
Classification is crucial
Careful parts classification helps to eliminate duplicate part designs and ensure the high quality of Weatherford's product data. The company's classification team engages with subject matter experts to comb data throughout the many legacy systems and find equivalences in part designs. They then create "new" part numbers and where possible map the existing legacy number to existing parts in the system, with descriptions in standard formats for consistent use in bills of materials and other applications.
Up to 40 attributes per part aid in distinguishing items. Geometrically identical parts can be described from the same drawing. This attribute-driven approach, says Lawrence, helps to "de-skill" part variant creation. "Often, generating a new repeated part from different materials can be a clerical function. No CAD license is required."
Classification helps Weatherford's users quickly search for and retrieve required parts. "In an organization as widespread and diverse as ours," Droke says, "just having a PLM system isn't enough. It's the classification of data that truly breaks down the silos of information. It's what makes easy search and retrieval a part of our everyday work life."
Parts classification also enhances cross-team collaboration. Asserts Lawrence: "It gets everyone on the same page, both internally and throughout the supply chain. Our teams work better and faster when they can have confidence that their product data is complete, accurate, and up to date. We can meet our customers' needs more efficiently."
Classification even creates synergies across business disciplines. "Our integration of classified data structures, product templates, attributes and allowed values is interwoven into all aspects of our business process and supply chain," says Droke.
With engineering, finance, marketing, and other Weatherford departments sharing consistent product data, they can perform sophisticated business analyses to find new opportunities for growth.
Having classification and attribute data available in reports linked to ERP data has enabled some groups to perform detailed business analysis looking at revenues for certain product lines or specific product models by geographic region, customer and well types. This type of reporting has sometimes led to more targeted marketing, internally to Weatherford staff and externally to customers.
Data analysis showed, for example, that Weatherford customers commonly needed certain sets of peripheral equipment. This led the company to create companion parts kits linked to main assemblies – a valuable new tool for customer services helping ensure that orders contain everything the customer needs to use equipment. Prior to this capability customer services would often have to consult engineering directly, or rely on product catalogues to ensure the required accessories were available to the customer.
"The data thus helped us anticipate our customers' needs and meet them innovatively," says Droke.
The Trade Compliance organization also depends heavily on product classification to make license and customs determinations for the company's international shipments.
Droke points to Weatherford's upfront commitment to classification launched as a "phase-one task" in their ERP/PLM initiative – as a key to successful implementation. Yet, as he makes clear, companies must approach classification fully aware of its challenges. "It's not a magic wand you can simply wave over your data and get everyone right in line," he says. "Classification is hard work. It's a major investment." 
Resistance overcome
PLM, per Lawrence, makes engineering change management a "closed-loop process" at Weatherford. "The system strictly enforces what users need to do," he says.
Access controls prevent unauthorized design changes. Yet the system also steadily advances the process. "The whole purpose of engineering change management is to make the change," says Lawrence. "Our customers can't put their oil rigs on hold waiting for an approved design change to be implemented."
Lawrence notes that Weatherford's PLM system met some internal resistance at first. "Some in the company," he says, "were inclined to view it as a nuisance – something 'the man' was forcing them to do. But as good data was added, and users began to access it regularly, they saw the value and became champions of the system."
Droke adds, "Today 'design anywhere, build anywhere' is more than just a slogan at Weatherford. It's reality. The quality of our product data helps to make it so."
