History[edit]
Blind[edit]

In late-1989, Mark Gonzales approached Rocco with the desire to be involved in his own company. Gonzales was riding for Vision which was the largest skateboard company at the time. Gonzales and Rocco decided to name the company Blind, in contrast to Gonzales' former sponsor. Jason Lee, who was, at the time, a World Industries team member, assisted with the development of the brand.
Plan B[edit]
In 1991, wanting to break from H-Street, co-founder Mike Ternasky formed the company Plan B with an exclusive production and distribution alliance with World Industries. In the deal, Plan B marketed itself from San Diego while World Industries did the rest, paying a royalty fee to Plan B.[citation needed]} Mike Ternasky was able to convince perennial freestyle world champion[citation needed] Rodney Mullen to switch to street skating thus becoming a member of the Plan B team.[citation needed]
In September 1993, Rick Howard defected with seven other riders from the fold of World Industries and started Girl. Mike Ternasky was killed in a car accident in 1994.[citation needed] Plan B and World Industries parted ways in 1997, and was run by Danny Way and Colin McKay, closing its doors shortly thereafter in 1998. In March 2005, Plan B was resurrected by team member and part-owner, Danny Way.
A-Team[edit]
As a direct response to Plan B's departure, Rodney Mullen created A-Team along with Marc Johnson, Gershon Mosley, Dave Mayhew, and Chet Thomas.
Restructure and growth[edit]
The years of 1996 to 1999 were years of significant restructuring and explosive growth for the company, led by the newly appointed executives, and subsequent shareholders, CEO Frank Messman and CFO Scott Drouillard. By the end of 1998, World Industries and Blind had achieved the status of number one and number two brands in skateboard hardgoods.[citation needed] This was in large part due to the re-positioning of the brands with Marc McKee's hugely popular cartoon characters of Devilman, Flame Boy and Wet Willy for World Industries, and the "Blind Reaper" for Blind.[citation needed].
Kubic Marketing[edit]
In October 1998, Steve Rocco and his then five other shareholder partners (including Rodney Mullen, Frank Messmann, and Scott Drouillard), sold a 70% majority interest of the company to an outside private equity group, SPC, while maintaining all key management and employees.[citation needed] The company was valued at $29 million at the point of sale. A parent company emerged by the name of Kubic Marketing ("Kubic") which owned World Industries and Dwindle Distribution.[citation needed]
In 1999, the parent company Kubic, bought the then-largest retailer (catalog and internet) CCS in the skateboard industry for $21 million. In 2000, due to financial issues, the company sold CCS to Alloy, a publicly listed company for approximately $50 million.
Globe International[edit]
In 2002, Globe International Limited, an Australian public company, purchased all companies of Kubic, including World Industries.[2]
i.e. Distribution[edit]
On June 25, 2007, Globe International Limited sold the World Industries brand to i.e. distribution.[1]
As of February 2014, World Industries continues to sponsor a team of skateboarders; however, an official promotional flyer appeared on February 6, 2014 following the addition of a skateboard deck line to team rider Anthony Shetler's clothing brand "All I Need" (AIN). The flyer states: "Shetler and Timmy Knuth will have pro models," but as of February 20, 2014, both Shetler and Knuth remain on the World Industries website as team members, and no further information has been released.[3][4]

Documentary[edit]
In 2007, Whyte House Productions released The Man Who Souled the World, a documentary about Steve Rocco and the creation of World Industries, as well as his other skateboard related companies and ventures.[5] The film release was accompanied by a skateboard art exhibition (featuring Marc McKee's art) titled, "Censorship is Weak as F##k."

MullenLowe WS

MullenLowe Winston Salem helps the NC Education Lottery celebrate 10 years of proud moments












Work




Pep Boys

Motor Oil Masterpiece



X


 


Pep Boys

Motor Oil Masterpiece
It’s nearly impossible to find dad a unique gift for Father’s Day. So we invented one using a little motor oil and a lot of ingenuity. We realized it’s OK to give dad a sentimental gift as long as it has a manly 5w-30 smell to it.






Ulta Beauty

First Haircut



X


 


Ulta Beauty

First Haircut
Every two minutes, a woman in the United States is diagnosed with breast cancer. She begins treatment. There is fear. There is doubt. There is loss of physical identity. And hopefully, thanks to advances in both research and medicine, there is recovery and a return to self. Ulta Beauty and MullenLowe U.S. revealed just how important breast cancer research is by documenting something most people take for granted: a haircut.






Ulta Beauty

Lose Yourself



X


 


Ulta Beauty

Lose Yourself
ULTA Beauty is the only retailer that puts all things beauty, from mass to prestige, across every category, under one roof. To help build awareness for this 25-year-old unknown brand, we partnered with surrealist photographer and director David LaChapelle. The campaign’s feminine yet disruptive nature breaks through the beauty clutter. The campaign has gained 10 points in awareness for ULTA Beauty and a 65% bump in brand consideration, resulting in a 25% increase in net new users.






Triad Dog Games





X


 


Triad Dog Games


The Sergei foundation, a nonprofit that provides financial aid to families unable to afford emergency care for their pets, sponsors The Triad Dog Games. The event, which features dogs running, jumping and weaving in a variety of competitions, raises money for the foundation. So when the Sergei Foundation came to us for help, we just couldn’t say no.







ADP

First Year



X


 


ADP

First Year
ADP, a leading global provider of Human Capital Management solutions, was looking to communicate to the world that it was about much more than just payroll. In fact, it’s actually a company that’s about building a better, happier and more efficient workplace. And ADP does this because it understands every company’s greatest asset: its people. This reality led to the new tag line, “A more human resource,” along with a :60 launch Web video that celebrates the human element in the workplace, as told through the eyes of a young woman starting a new job.






McGraw Hill Financial

Life's Unfair



X


 


McGraw Hill Financial

Life's Unfair
For the global launch of the S&P Capital IQ brand, we created a rich-media, brand-essence piece that tapped into the mindset of the highly competitive, shark-tank-worthy target audience. The message was simple: While we can all admit that life is unfair, S&P Capital IQ makes the tools to drastically tilt the playing field — in your favor.






Small Batch





X


 


Small Batch


Small Batch Beer Company had a vision to brew unique and creative beers using only a one-barrel system. Since Small Batch beers are brewed only 30 gallons at a time, they sell out fast, so we developed a website that would, in real time, display exactly how much of each specialty beer was on tap.






CSX

The Intermodals



X


 


CSX

The Intermodals
CSX’s intermodal business unit has become an increasingly important part of driving CSX sales and profit. We were tasked with creating social content that educated key logistics industry influencers and decision-makers on intermodal shipping. To do so, we developed a cast of characters called “The Intermodals” in a series of short Web videos that followed a group of trains, trucks and ships at an intermodal shipping facility. The stories were human, funny and insightful.







NC Education Lottery





X


 


NC Education Lottery


The North Carolina Education Lottery recently introduced Ultimate Millions, a scratch-off game that could pay 10 million dollars to a single winner. With the highest top prize in state history, this game’s sure to attract the high rollers of the scratch-off world, who’ve come to expect a little more from the clerk behind the counter.






Ulta Beauty

My Beautiful Mom



X


 


Ulta Beauty

My Beautiful Mom
What started as a digital campaign for Mother’s Day soon became Ulta Beauty’s most engaging activation to date. With their second-largest selling season right around the corner, the time felt right to engage with an already active social following. We kicked the campaign off with a video that asked civilians on the street, “When was the last time you told your mom she was beautiful?” That simple question led to a much larger conversation in the social space around #MyBeautifulMom, inviting viewers to finally tell their mom she was beautiful.






Food Lion

Best Day Ever



X


 


Food Lion

Best Day Ever
Food Lion is a grocery store chain in the Mid- and South Atlantic states with a history of being an integral part of people’s lives. In an effort to create a more emotional connection with shoppers, we wanted to portray how Food Lion makes life better beyond helping you save money on groceries. This spot introduces the lion as someone you can count on to be by your family’s side and make life better all day, every day.






McGladrey

Caddie for Love



X


 


McGladrey

Caddie for Love
Caddie for Love was an integrated communications initiative that engaged McGladrey’s key C-suite targets by tapping into their passion for golf. Traditional media drove our target to CaddieForLove.com, where they were invited to submit essays, pictures and videos expressing how they would bring McGladrey’s positioning, “the power of being understood,” to the business of caddying for Davis Love III, Captain of the 2012 Ryder Cup team. The audience stayed engaged through several rounds of voting, and the winner was on the bag with Davis for The McGladrey Classic Pro-Am.







L'eggs

Catch Me If You Can



X


 


L'eggs

Catch Me If You Can
To promote the L’eggs Energy line, we created the largest game of virtual catch the digital world has ever seen. To engage, reward and increase social followers, an Instagram activation asked viewers to catch a screenshot of legs in motion and include #PlayCatch for a chance to win L’eggs product and cash prizes. With a 436% increase in Instagram followers, we’d say it was a game well-played.






Pep Boys

Car Problems are People Problems



X


 


Pep Boys

Car Problems are People Problems
Due to years of heavy promotional support, Pep Boys stood for nothing more than a discount. So we wanted to re-establish why an authentic brand like Pep Boys exists — to make sure car owners' lives run as smoothly as humanly possible. To shed light on this in an unexpected and memorable way, we showed people in everyday situations whose appearance and actions mirror the way their failing vehicles act. We then demonstrated how Pep Boys gets these people and their vehicles back to functioning normally. After all, car problems don’t just affect your vehicle — they affect your life.






American Signature

Lebron James



X


 


American Signature

Lebron James
LeBron James is known the world over for his unearthly basketball skills. When presented with creating a line of children’s furniture from American Signature, it was an opportunity for MullenLowe to expand LeBron’s brand beyond athletics. Combining research and parental intuition, we determined that there is one room in the house where a child calls all the shots — his bedroom. And LeBron James, regardless of his superstar status, will have to earn his way into that room. After all, the kid is going to have to live with the furniture for a long time, so it better be up to standard.






CSX

How Tomorrow Moves



X


 


CSX

How Tomorrow Moves
When most people think of freight rail, they think of an old, outdated mode of transportation that has virtually no relevance to them. And when most people thought of CSX, they thought of, well, nothing at all. We needed to get people to understand that CSX freight trains have a very real and positive impact on their lives.







Sprout

A Lot Happens When You Sprout



X


 


Sprout

A Lot Happens When You Sprout
As the 24-hour preschool channel filled with shows, activities and adventure for both preschoolers and parents to view and do together, Sprout packs a pretty full day. Which led us to a unique brand positioning: A lot happens when you Sprout. After all, it’s those real, everyday moments that matter most.






CSX

Drop & Give Them 10



X


 


CSX

Drop & Give Them 10
While a source of internal pride, it’s a little-known fact that close to one quarter of the entire CSX workforce has served in the military. To humbly share this fact and to raise money and awareness for those who serve their country, we leveraged the one thing all soldiers have in common - the pushup. It’s the universal military drill. Taking it one step further, pushups were turned into currency, which in turn became a donation to Wounded Warrior Project®. The insight blossomed into an integrated communication initiative that raised money for a good cause and developed a bond among soldiers, citizens and CSX.






Tresemme

Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week



X


 


Tresemme

Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week
How do you get a peek into the guarded tents of New York's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week? You rely on the official hair care sponsor, TRESemmé. For fashion’s biggest week, Mullen created a branded out-of-home campaign that drove passersby to an interactive mobile site that featured exclusive behind-the-scenes content and a glimpse of all the TRESemmé hairstyles strutting the runway.





Clients





























































A Different Kind of Beast 
We are a different kind of company.
We’re a global boutique.
We have to punch above our weight.
We listen harder and fight smarter.
We’re publicly held but independently minded.
We don’t aspire to have great meetings.
We aspire to have great outcomes.
We don’t have layers of managers.
We all roll up our sleeves.
We choose our partners:
Bold and brave marketers who will challenge
And respect us as much as we challenge and respect them.
We hire people who scare us.
Because mediocrity scares us more.
We don’t innovate because it’s trendy; we do it because it works.
We believe technology can foster great ideas.
And that diversity inspires originality.
This philosophy gets our clients more than their fair share of attention.
And it’s these contradictions that make us
The truly unique global challenger we are today.
6,400 people with the same purpose:
To challenge all norms.
90 offices with one mission:
To work with the world’s most innovative companies.
We’re a madly creative,
Fiercely competitive,
Hyperbundled beast.





Hyper Bundled 
We believe that smashing together our
creative, strategic planning, technology,
media, social marketing and analytics
talent generates the best ideas to propel
our clients.
We call it “hyperbundling.” In keeping with
the agency’s entrepreneurial spirit, we’ve built
all of our capabilities organically, not through
acquisition, and developed an organizational
model that fosters constant collaboration
between and within disciplines for higher
value ideas and optimal client benefit.
