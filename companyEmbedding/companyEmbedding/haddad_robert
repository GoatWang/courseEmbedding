I am always 'farmed out' to his medical assistant. They require visits every 6 months and when I come in I still never see the Doctor.  They seem unware of why I am coming in, even when it is to followup on test results.  They never seem to look at my file until they sit down with me and then often seem in a hurry or are running late.55-Jeanne Pelletz  in Estero FL  | Jun 06, 2017Brilliant.  Very busy office but staff are warm and friendly. Has opened up the practice to interns doing rotations which is an added plus I feel since training hospitals are limited in this area. 15-Katie Gutmann in Ft Myers, FL | Jan 23, 2017Terrrible experience.Scared me without explaining reason for ordering echocardiogram/heart monitor. I was told by office staff that I would receive call regarding where I would go for heart monitor to be placed. No call. Heart monitor showed up at my home door. When I called the office to inquire if this is the monitor that would be covered by my insurance I was told to call my insurance company because it wasn't their responsibility. Office manager (wife) rude and mean. MD does not return calls55-Lara Daoud in Naples, FL | Jul 20, 2016Dr. Haddad is exactly what I expect in a physician. He is thorough, kind & always professional. He listens & allocates an adequate amount of time to answer all of your questions. He is an excellent doctor & I feel fortunate to have him as my physician. I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone & I have referred several friends, co-workers & neighbors to him.  I unequivocally trust him with my life & health. I've witnessed other MD'a in town misdiagnose people be careful who you trust!55-JTT in Cape Coral, FL | Feb 21, 2016Extremely knowledgeable, great communicator with the patient; caring and personable;  really listens and takes a lot of time with you; has a great staff; all are nice, professional and caring; he immediately saw me, diagnosed pneumonia and helped me to recover quickly and took care to monitor me every 2-3 days.  I am so grateful to have him as our Internist!  He is a one of a kind.15-William Peyron Jr in Naples, FL | Jan 23, 2016Compared to my other Internal Medicine doctors he was extremely substandard.  Never offered to provide copies of lab tests and left most of his patient contact with his ARNP.
Do not go to him.  There are better Internal Medicine doctors out there.55-Amy E in Lehigh Acres, FL | Dec 29, 2015Dr. Haddad is the best primary care provider I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.  He takes the time to listen to his patients and he also is a hands on doctor and wants to make sure he is following every aspect of his individual patients health.  He has a office staff that is top notch in my book.More CommentsHave you seen Dr. Robert Haddad, MD?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Haddad?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Haddad has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Florida.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Haddad's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Haddad's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.Dr. Haddad is Board Certified in:Internal MedicineAccrediting Board: American Board of Internal Medicine ** This information is proprietary data maintained in a copyrighted database compilation owned by the American Board of Medical Specialties.
