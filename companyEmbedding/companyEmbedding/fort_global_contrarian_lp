SummaryGlobal Diversified has evolved since FORT’s inception in 1993. Originally composed entirely of the Trend strategy, Contrarian was added as approximately 50% of the portfolio in 2002. In 2009, Short-Term Mean Reversion was added as approximately 10% (Contrarian and Trend both approximately 45%), and in August, 2014, Equity Market Neutral was added. The Equity Market Neutral strategy was traded with proprietary capital for 5 ½ years before being added to Global Diversified.  Currently, Global Diversified is made up of approximately 29% Trend, 29% Contrarian, 9% Short-Term Mean Reversion, and 33% Equity Market Neutral. Investment StrategyThis product is a combination of the four strategies that the firm has ever developed and they are uncorrelated to each other and the equity markets.  There are 3 futures strategies (trend, Contrarian, and short term mean reversion) and an equity market neutral strategy.Risk ManagementThe model employs the Bayesian process of shifting risk from underperforming to outperforming asset classes.  The four underlying strategies have little correlation and individual contract exposure is capped.  The maximum marging to equity it 12% but the average is around 7-9%.
