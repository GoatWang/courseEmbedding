Limited liability company (LLC)
Mergers and acquisitionsCity and stateWhat a Business lawyer can do for youA business lawyer will advise you on many different aspects relating to business, such as regulation compliance, business incorporation, and legal liability.

The sooner you retain a business attorney, the better. Your lawyer will make sure that you set up your business properly, create contracts for you, make sure you're hiring legal workers, file patents, buy and sell businesses, and more.What does a business lawyer do?
Many business owners, especially small business owners, think of contacting a lawyer or law firm only when there's an urgent problem that needs to be handled. This approach can be short-sighted. Developing a relationship with a business lawyer you trust can help prevent problems that may arise as your business grows and new legal issues arise.
Choose a legal structure
You may be tempted to organize your business as a simple sole proprietorship. For some business owners, this choice may make sense. However, each situation is different, and your interests may be better served with an LLC or S-corp. If you are starting a business with another person, you should know the difference between a limited liability partnership and other legal entities. If you plan to form an incorporation in the future or stay a small LLC forever are also questions which need to be asked. A small business lawyer can advise you on the right structure for you and draft the proper paperwork.
Corporate governance
If you organize your business as a corporation, you will need to comply with the legal requirements to keep your status, such as holding shareholder or partner meetings, recording minutes, creating bylaws, and electing officers. A lawyer can keep you stay up-to-date with these functions, fees and policy needed. 
Intellectual property
If your business is developing proprietary products or processes that need to be protected, a lawyer can help you with contracts and copyright and patent applications, such as nondisclosure agreements, that protect your intangible assets. If your company is going to be creating a lot of intellectual property which could become sued over in the future it is especially important that a lawyer look over all paperwork before it is submitted. 
Litigation
If you are ever the subject of a lawsuit, such as a discrimination or harassment suit from an employee, or an action by a customer,company or vendor, you should consult with an attorney immediately. If a state or federal agency, such as OSHA, investigates you, a lawyer can be your advocate and adviser since they are versed in business law. At this point privacy of information may also come into play so a lawyer should be able to walk you through a standard NDA or privacy agreement. 
Exit strategies
Many entrepreneurs are eager to start a new business, but they may not think about the possibility that a principal or major stakeholder wants to stop running the business and  leave. A business attorney will help you determine the value of your business, should your plans ever change.
How much does a business lawyer cost?
Experienced corporate lawyers can cost between $300 and $600 per hour, depending on a variety of factors, such as the following:

Geographic location. Lawyers in major cities may charge more money than those in smaller communities.
Level of experience. A partner will cost more per hour than an associate in a firm.
Firm size. Lawyers with large, national law firms may charge more than those in smaller firms.

In some cases, a lawyer will charge a flat fee for performing a specific task, such as drafting employment contracts and nondisclosure agreements or setting up an LLC.
5 questions to ask during your initial consultation
Once you've narrowed down your options to a few potential attorneys based on credentials and costs, consider asking them these questions to help you decide which lawyer to contact and ultimately hire:

How many clients do you have in my business niche and are you familiar with my industry or field?
Will you personally handle my legal paperwork or assign it to an associate or team?
Can an associate or paralegal handle some of my legal tasks at a lower rate to keep my costs down?
Do you work on a retainer, charge an hourly rate, or assess a fixed rate for a product?
Will you or your firm be able to handle all of my business needs, such as tax law or litigation?

Not all business owners will need an attorney when they start a business, but most will benefit from the advice and guidance of a practiced business lawyer at some point in the process. Many new business owners do not regret when they hire an attorney.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
