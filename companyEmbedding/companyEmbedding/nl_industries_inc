NL Industries

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

NL Industries (NYSE: NL), formerly known as the National Lead Company, is a lead smelting company currently based in Houston, Texas. National Lead was one of the 12 original stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the time of its creation on May 26, 1896.[1]

History[edit]
It began business in Philadelphia in 1772.[2] The name "National Lead Company" was used since 1891 after a series of mergers. National Lead changed its name to NL Industries in 1971.
California lead paint liability case[edit]
NL Industries has encountered legal problems based on their long history of selling lead paint. Exposure to lead paint can cause numerous health and developmental problems in children and adults, and its use has been banned or restricted in many countries.
In January 2014, the Santa Clara County Superior Court ruled that NL Industries, along with Sherwin-Williams and ConAgra were jointly and severally liable for $1.15 billion, to be paid into a lead paint abatement fund to be used to remove lead paint from older housing.[3][4] The judge ruled that the paint companies manufactured, marketed, and sold lead paint without disclosing the health risks to the consumers in spite of "actual and constructive knowledge that it was harmful."[5][6]
National Lead and Dutch Boy Paints[edit]
in 1907, National Lead entered the consumer market for titanium paints, creating a product line under the name "Dutch Boy". Dutch Boy paints competed with other brands that contained mineral products supplied by National Lead. The "Dutch Boy Painter", which was created by Lawrence Carmichael Earle, became National Lead's symbol for many years.
NL Industries sold off the Dutch Boy brand in 1980 to Sherwin-Williams, two years after the CPSC's directive banning on the manufacturing of lead housepaint went into effect.

NL Industries (NYSE: NL), formerly known as the National Lead Company, is a lead smelting company currently based in Houston, Texas. National Lead was one of the 12 original stocks included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the time of its creation on May 26, 1896.[1]

History[edit]
It began business in Philadelphia in 1772.[2] The name "National Lead Company" was used since 1891 after a series of mergers. National Lead changed its name to NL Industries in 1971.
California lead paint liability case[edit]
NL Industries has encountered legal problems based on their long history of selling lead paint. Exposure to lead paint can cause numerous health and developmental problems in children and adults, and its use has been banned or restricted in many countries.
In January 2014, the Santa Clara County Superior Court ruled that NL Industries, along with Sherwin-Williams and ConAgra were jointly and severally liable for $1.15 billion, to be paid into a lead paint abatement fund to be used to remove lead paint from older housing.[3][4] The judge ruled that the paint companies manufactured, marketed, and sold lead paint without disclosing the health risks to the consumers in spite of "actual and constructive knowledge that it was harmful."[5][6]
National Lead and Dutch Boy Paints[edit]
in 1907, National Lead entered the consumer market for titanium paints, creating a product line under the name "Dutch Boy". Dutch Boy paints competed with other brands that contained mineral products supplied by National Lead. The "Dutch Boy Painter", which was created by Lawrence Carmichael Earle, became National Lead's symbol for many years.
NL Industries sold off the Dutch Boy brand in 1980 to Sherwin-Williams, two years after the CPSC's directive banning on the manufacturing of lead housepaint went into effect.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE



	 



	NL REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2017 RESULTS





	DALLAS, TEXAS – May 8, 2017 - NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL) today reported a net income attributable to NL stockholders of $8.4 million, or $.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2017 compared to net loss attributable to NL stockholders of $2.5 million, or $.05 per share, in the first quarter of 2016.





	Net sales increased $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher Security Products sales volumes to existing government security customers, partially offset by a decrease in sales of security products to an original equipment manufacturer of recreational transportation products.  CompX's Marine Components business also contributed higher sales in the 2017 period.  Income from operations attributable to CompX increased to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017 from $3.4 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to higher sales and manufacturing efficiencies facilitated by higher production volumes at CompX's Security Products business.





	Kronos' net sales of $369.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 were $51.4 million, or 16%, higher than in the first quarter of 2016.  Kronos' net sales increased in the first quarter 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher average TiO

	2

	selling prices and higher sales volumes.  Kronos' average TiO

	2

	selling prices were 17% higher in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016, and Kronos' average selling prices at the end of the first quarter of 2017 were 4% higher than at the end of 2016, with higher prices in all major markets.  TiO

	2

	sales volumes in the first quarter of 2017 were 3% higher as compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to higher sales in the North American and export markets, partially offset by lower sales in the European market.  Kronos' sales volumes in the first quarter of 2017 set a new overall record for a first quarter period.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (primarily the euro) also affected net sales comparisons, decreasing net sales by approximately $7 million in the first quarter 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  The table at the end of this press release shows how each of these items impacted the overall increase in Kronos' sales.





	Kronos' income from operations in the first quarter of 2017 was $52.3 million as compared to a loss from operations of $.3 million in the first quarter of 2016.

	 

	Kronos' income from operations increased in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher average TiO

	2

	selling prices, higher sales and production volumes and lower raw materials and other production costs.  Kronos' TiO

	2

	production volumes were 10% higher in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016.  Kronos operated its production facilities at an overall average capacity utilization rate of 100% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to approximately 97% in the first quarter of 2016.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates also affected Kronos' income from operations comparisons, which decreased income from operations by approximately $8 million.





	Kronos' other operating income, net in the first quarter of 2016 includes an insurance settlement gain of $2.0 million (NL's equity interest was $.3 million, or $.01 per share, net of income tax expense) related to a 2014 business interruption claim.





	Kronos' income tax expense in 2017 includes a $5.0 million (NL's equity interest was $1.0 million, or $0.2 per share) non-cash deferred income tax benefit as a result of a net decrease in its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to its German and Belgian operations.





	Corporate expenses decreased $.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower litigation fees and related costs offset partially by higher environmental remediation and related costs.  Interest and dividend income increased $.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to interest earned on CompX's loan to an affiliate which was entered into in August 2016.











	The statements in this release relating to matters that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that represent management's beliefs and assumptions based on currently available information.  Although NL believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot give any assurances that these expectations will prove to be correct.  Such statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results, and actual future results could differ materially from those described in such forward-looking statements.  While it is not possible to identify all factors, we continue to face many risks and uncertainties.  Among the factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially include, but are not limited to:


	 







	·




	Future supply and demand for our products










	·




	The extent of the dependence of certain of our businesses on certain market sectors

	·




	Changes in the availability of raw material (such as ore)










	·




	General global economic and political conditions (such as changes in the level of gross domestic product in various regions of the world and the impact of such changes on demand for, among other things, TiO

	2

	and component products)










	·




	Competitive products and substitute products










	·




	Price and product competition from low-cost manufacturing sources (such as China)

	·




	The introduction of trade barriers










	·




	Possible disruption of Kronos' or CompX's business, or increases in our  cost of doing business resulting from terrorist activities or global conflicts










	·




	The impact of current or future government regulations (including employee healthcare benefit related regulations)










	·




	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates (such as changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and each of the euro, the Norwegian krone and the Canadian dollar), or possible disruptions to our business resulting from potential instability resulting from uncertainties associated with the euro or other currencies










	·




	Operating interruptions (including, but not limited to, labor disputes, leaks, natural disasters, fires, explosions, unscheduled or unplanned downtime, transportation interruptions and cyber attacks)










	·




	Decisions to sell operating assets other than in the ordinary course of business










	·




	Kronos' ability to renew or refinance credit facilities










	·




	Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity










	·




	The timing and amounts of insurance recoveries










	·




	The extent to which our subsidiaries or affiliates were to become unable to pay us dividends










	·




	The ultimate outcome of income tax audits, tax settlement initiatives or other tax matters










	·




	Uncertainties associated with CompX's development of new product features










	·




	Our ability to utilize income tax attributes or changes in income tax rates related to such attributes, the benefits of which may not have been recognized under the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria








	- 2 -


















	·




	Environmental matters (such as those requiring compliance with emission and discharge standards for existing and new facilities or new developments regarding environmental remediation at sites related to our former operations)










	·




	Government laws and regulations and possible changes therein (such as changes in government regulations which might impose various obligations on former manufacturers of lead pigment and lead-based paint, including us, with respect to asserted health concerns associated with the use of such products)










	·




	The ultimate resolution of pending litigation (such as our lead pigment and environmental matters)










	·




	Possible future litigation.






	 



	Should one or more of these risks materialize (or the consequences of such a development worsen), or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from those currently forecasted or expected.  We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of changes in information, future events or otherwise.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
