Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Home Depot, Best Buy stocks suffer from Amazon effect
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    10:21 AM ET 07/20/2017
                                                


Home Depot Inc.' s stock tumbled 4.2% in morning trade Thursday toward a three-month low, enough to be the Dow Jones Industrial Average's biggest loser, in the wake of Sears Holdings Corp.' s announcement that it will sell appliances through Amazon.com Inc.. Appliances have been among the best performing categories for Home Depot (HD). The stock's selloff was the main reason for Dow's price decline.

















                                                    J.C. Penney is right to try new things, but it needs to do more to compete with Amazon, analysts say
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    2:42 PM ET 07/19/2017
                                                


Penney taken a scattershot approach to adding new product lines, including toys, cosmetics and hotel furnishings. Penney Co. Inc. has made a series of moves in the past year to mix up its product offer and entice shoppers back into its stores, but the retailer has more to do to stave off the threat from Amazon.com Inc.. That's according to analysts and experts, who commend the company for at least trying something new, even if it has taken a rather scattershot approach.

















                                                    Apparel retailer shares rise after analyst comment on improved traffic
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch –
