UAE, in order to best fit with the needs of its clients in the Middle
East.


                                        BlueLine considers in fact its mission as being to build a bridge
between Middle Eastern and Western countries or companies
in the frame of a respectful relation and reciprocal interest. 



 BlueLine concentrates therefore its efforts on trade and financial
operations, with the objective to offer its services to companies
aiming at being active in the Middle East and looking for new
opportunities (for instance in Iran) while letting them take
benefit from its network and know how as well as applying the
methodical and neutral Swiss way of doing. 
 What else? 
 BlueLine is able to provide to companies and entities in Iran
any Swiss product at very favourable conditions.
