MEET OUR CLINICAL EXPERT 
Dr. Steve Cataldo, co-inventor of the SuperNO2VA™, is a physician anesthesiologist based out of New York City, and the Director of Medical Sciences at RMD.  Early in his career, Dr. Cataldo recognized the increasing impact that upper airway obstruction and hypoventilation are having on high-risk patients undergoing anesthesia. Specifically focused on maintaining airway patency and providing ventilatory support throughout a patient’s stay in the perioperative surgical home, he has employed his knowledge of cardiorespiratory physiology, years of clinical research experience, and advice from an extensive network of key opinion leaders to develop the SuperNO2VA™ platform and foster its evolution over time.  Dr. Cataldo enjoys being “in the field,” giving presentations at multiple institutions for Grand Rounds as well as at national conferences, including the World Airway Management Meeting in 2015 and the American Dental Society of Anesthesiologists in 2016.  Dr. Cataldo earned his M.D. and completed his residency training in anesthesia at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY and is an active member of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, New York State Society of Anesthesiologists, and Society for Airway Management.

European CE Marking Strategy for Medical Devices 


ANSWERED ON THIS PAGE:
What is the CE Mark and what does it mean?
What is the CE Marking process for medical devices?
Who is responsible for maintaining regulatory compliance?
To sell medical devices in the European Union (EU), you must obtain or apply CE Marking for your product. CE Marking indicates a product’s compliance with the applicable EU regulations and enables the commercialization of your products in 32 European countries. As a legal medical device manufacturer, you are responsible for maintaining regulatory compliance and securing CE marking for your product, regardless of whether you outsource any or all components of your manufacturing operation. IVD? See this page.
How to obtain CE marking for your medical device
CE is not a quality mark, but compliance with EU Directives requires you to meet specific standards of performance, quality, safety, and efficacy for your product type. We have a detailed chart explaining the current European CE approval process here. However, the basic process follows these steps:
Determine which EU Directive applies to your device: Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC), In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive (98/79/EC) or Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (90/385/EEC) 
Determine the classification of your device. See our chart.
Implement a Quality Management System, if applicable to your device. Most companies use ISO 13485 to meet the requirements.
Prepare a CE Marking Technical File or a Design Dossier
Select and appoint a European Authorized Representative to act on your behalf within the EU if you have no physical location in Europe.
Have your QMS and Technical File/Design Dossier audited by a Notified Body, unless your device is Class I, is not sterile and has no measuring function.
Obtain CE Marking and ISO 13485 certificates from your Notified Body.
Prepare a Declaration of Conformity (DoC), which states that your device complies with the appropriate Directive.
NOTE: The CE Marking process will change as Europe’s new Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) comes into force in May 2020. Download our MDR white paper to learn what will change.
Let Emergo assist you with CE compliance
Emergo has a well-established presence in the EU with offices in the UK, Germany, France, and The Netherlands. We have assisted hundreds of medical device manufacturers with CE compliance for Europe. Our services include:
Assistance with product classification
Verify applicable standards and testing requirements
Technical File or Design Dossier compilation, or review of your files

Frequently Asked Questions
How long is a CE certificate valid?
Under the current system, CE certificates issued by Notified Bodies are generally valid for three years. The validity period may only be one year for some high risk devices. However, the status of your CE certification is dependent on maintaining your quality system certification.
Our device already has CE Marking. How will MDR 2017/745 affect our status?
The MDR is expected to come into effect in May 2020. Certificates issued prior to final implementation of the MDR will have a maximum validity of five years. However, all CE Mark certifications issued before implementation of the new regulations will automatically expire four years after the new regulations come into force.
Who will issue my CE Marking certificate?
If your medical device is Class I (provided sterile or has a measuring function), Class IIa, IIb, or III, or if your IVD falls under Annex II, List A; Annex II, List B, or is self-testing, you will receive a CE certificate from a Notified Body. Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices and general/other IVDs may be self-certified and do not require a CE certificate from a Notified Body.
Does the Notified Body name appear on my product labeling?
Their name will not appear but their four-digit NB number will appear under the CE Mark symbol on your labeling.
Will changing a contract manufacturer impact my CE certification?
Yes, because this is a change in critical suppliers. In this situation, Legal Manufacturers (i.e., "owners" of the CE marking) will select a new contract manufacturer based on criteria outlined in their quality system, which should describe how to qualify and continually assess their suppliers.
The Legal Manufacturer must notify their Notified Body of this change and request an updated CE certificate. The Notified Body may require an onsite audit of the new contract manufacturer to issue an updated CE Certificate.

US FDA 510(k) Consulting for Medical Devices and IVDs


ANSWERED ON THIS PAGE:
Which medical device classifications require an FDA 510(k)?
What are the phases of the 510(k) preparation process?
How long is our 510(k) clearance valid?
One of the first steps toward selling a Class II medical device or IVD in the United States is to file a Premarket Notification with the FDA, also known as an FDA 510(k) submission. Technically, the FDA does not "approve" medical devices or IVDs for sale under the 510(k) process; the agency gives "clearance" for them to be sold in the U.S. We use the term "FDA approval" and "FDA clearance interchangably.
Free whitepaper: Overview of the US FDA 510(k) medical device process.
Who must submit an FDA 510(k) premarket notification?
In general, manufacturers wishing to introduce Class II medical devices (and a small number of Class I and III devices) or IVDs to the US market must submit a 510(k) to the FDA. A 510(k) premarket notification is also required for manufacturers changing the intended use of their medical device, or changing the technology of a cleared device in such a way that it may significantly affect the device's safety or effectiveness.
We can help with US FDA 510(k) submissions
To ensure a successful 510(k) submission, we take a two-step approach. Over the years, we have found this approach is cost-effective for our clients, and it dramatically reduces the probability of failure to receive FDA clearance of a 510(k) submission.
Step 1: Pre 510(k) submission gap analysis and requirements evaluation
The proposed intended use and design of your device help us determine the proper FDA product code and regulation number, which may point to device-specific guidance documents or required standards.
We evaluate similar devices that already have FDA 510(k) clearance to determine whether any are suitable for use to determine substantial equivalence for your device. These are referred to as predicate devices.
We provide a product-specific list of documents and information needed for the 510(k) submission.
An assigned U.S. regulatory consultant will review the information to determine its suitability for the 510(k) submission.
After evaluating this documentation, we prepare a detailed gap analysis report identifying incomplete or missing information required for a complete 510(k) submission.
Once you receive the comprehensive gap analysis, Emergo can help you close these "gaps" and will review additional information.
Step 2: Dossier compilation and FDA 510(k) submission
When all required documents and information have been received, Emergo will prepare your final 510(k) submission. We will:
Prepare a technical comparison of your medical device to the predicate device(s).
Prepare all 21 sections of the FDA 510(k) application.
Submit the hard copy and eCopy of the 510(k) to the CDRH division within the FDA and be the correspondent for further communications with the FDA.
Coordinate payment of FDA 510(k) submission fees on your behalf.
Immediately communicate with you regarding all information received from the FDA following the 510(k) submission, and assist in addressing their requests for additional information, if applicable.
Learn more about what happens after 510(k) regulatory clearance.
We want you to be successful introducing your device to the US market. As a FDA consulting firm for medical devices and IVD, we have successfully prepared and submitted FDA 510(k) submissions for medical device and IVD companies from around the world seeking to sell in the United States.

Common Questions
Will I receive a registration certificate after 510(k) clearance?
No. You will not receive a registration certificate after 510(k) clearance but the FDA will issue a 510(k) clearance letter and post it on their website. The website posting is your official proof that your device was cleared by the FDA.
How long is my 510(k) approval valid?
The 510(k) regulatory clearance is valid until you implement changes to the product, intended use, or indications for use. Changes must be assessed to determine if they warrant a new submission to the FDA.
If there is a predicate, do I have to do the same testing?
In general, you are required to do performance testing on your device, preferably as comparative testing with the known predicate. The test results must support the substantial equivalence of your product to the predicate.
Can a 510(k) be transferred to another company? Who owns it?
The company submitting the 510(k) is considered the owner of the 510(k). In some cases this may not be the manufacturer of the device. If the "owner" of the 510(k) is acquired, the the purchaser will list the device as part of their updated establishment registration, and that is considered sufficient to notify the FDA of a new owner and complete the transfer. If the manufacturing site changes, the company must validate the processes at the new site under the QMS and the new facility must be registered with the FDA.
What is considered a device family? What products can be in a single submission?
Devices that share the same FDA classification regulation/product code can often be “bundled” into a single submission. There are also times that devices with different product codes may be submitted in a single 510(k), if they are intended to be used together to perform the intended use of the 'family.'
For devices made outside the U.S., is home country approval required?
Home country approval is not required to receive FDA clearance.

PMDA Medical Device Registration and Approval in Japan


ANSWERED ON THIS PAGE:
What is the classification scheme for medical devices?
What are the registration procedures in Japan?
How do regulatory requirements differ for domestic vs. foreign manufacturers?
Japan is considered one of the more challenging markets for foreign medical device manufacturers due its complex registration process and language barriers. But once you understand the device registration process, you will see it is actually not complicated and the rewards are worth the effort. Japan's lucrative medical device market is still the second largest in the world, ahead of China and Germany.
The Japanese regulation and approval process
Medical device companies interested in offering their products in Japan must comply with Japan's Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act (PMD Act). Complying with the PMD Act can be challenging for foreign manufacturers, as very few regulatory documents are published in English.
As part of the approval process, medical device manufacturers must:
Comply with MHLW Ordinance No. 169 related to quality management systems
Appoint an in-country representative (MAH/D-MAH)
Register design and manufacturing facilities, among other requirements
Registration procedures for medical devices sold in Japan
The registration pathway for your device is determined by its classification and associated Japan Medical Device Nomenclature (JMDN). For a detailed explanation of the process, download our Japan regulatory process chart (English) or watch this video.
To market medical devices in Japan, your Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) must register your device through one of the following procedures. Emergo can assist you with any medical device approval in Japan, regardless of classification or JMDN code.
Pre-market submission (Todokede)
Emergo can help register General Medical Devices (Class I) and file a pre-market submission to the PMDA. This is a notification and no review/assessment by the PMDA will be conducted.
Pre-market certification (Ninsho)
Class II (and a limited number of Class III) devices which have an associated certification standard (JIS), are subject to pre-market certification. Many, but not all, Japan Industrial Standards are based on existing ISO/IEC standards. Your MAH will file your application with a Registered Certification Body (RCB). The process is similar to the European CE Marking process where reviews are outsourced to a third party similar to a Notified Body.
Pre-market approval (Shonin)
Class II and III devices without a specific certification standard, are subject to the pre-market approval process. This also applies to all Class IV devices. In this case your MAH will file a pre-market approval application with the PMDA and ultimately obtain approval from the MHLW.
Let Emergo assist you with PMDA medical device registration
With an experienced team in Tokyo, Emergo can assist your company with all aspects of the medical device registration process in Japan. Here's how we can help:
Device classification: We will assess the classification for your medical device.
In-country representation: If you select Emergo as your Designated Marketing Authorization Holder (D-MAH), we will be able to communicate with Japanese authorities on your behalf and give you more control over your registrations.
Documentation preparation: Emergo can prepare all necessary documentation for pre-market submission, certification, and approval, and coordinate the submission to the PMDA or the RCB.
QMS consulting and implementation: Our quality consultants are experts in Ministerial Ordinance #169 and ISO 13485. We can help you comply with QMS regulations in Japan.
Clinical consulting: Emergo can assist with the PMDA pre-submission consultation process if you need to confirm the necessity of clinical data, additional clinical trials, or the validity of your protocol for clinical trials and/or other testing.
Emergo's team in Tokyo has worked on hundreds of PMDA medical device and IVD submissions so we fully understand the process and how to get your device approved as efficiently as possible. Please contact us for more information on obtaining medical device approval in Japan.

Frequently Asked Questions about PMDA Registration in Japan
How are devices classified in Japan?
Medical devices in Japan are classified using a coded predicate system combined with a rule-based risk assessment based on GHTF classification rules. Japan Medical Device Nomenclature (JMDN) codes identify the device classification and registration pathway. Devices are segmented into General Class I, Specified Controlled Class II, Controlled Class II, Specified Highly Controlled Class III, Highly Controlled Class III, or Highly Controlled Class IV.
How long does it take to register devices in Japan?
Timelines for medical device registration in Japan vary considerably depending on your device classification. Download our informative PDF chart (English) for details on the process and timelines.
Will our clinical studies and testing conducted outside Japan be accepted?
The PMDA often accepts the results of clinical trials conducted outside Japan if the investigation conforms to Japan's Good Clinical Practices. We can provide you with the support necessary to take a pre-submission consultation meeting with the PMDA to determine acceptability of the foreign clinical data. If the PMDA requires additional clinical investigations, Emergo can assist you with contracts, GCP documentation, clinical investigation document review, and more.
Can we "own" our Japanese device registration?
The MHLW permits manufacturers with no location in Japan to register their own Class II, III, and IV devices through the Foreign Special Approval System (FSAS). This registration route allows you to own your device registrations in your own name and take on some of the responsibilities of the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH). However, because you have no Japanese office, you still need to appoint a licensed Designated Marketing Authorization Holder (D-MAH) in Japan that will coordinate shipment releases to your distributor and handle complaints and vigilance.
Manufacturing establishment registration for domestic manufacturers vs. foreign manufacturers
The PMD Act defined a new registration system for manufacturers. The registration system requires domestic manufacturers to register their manufacturing establishments with their local prefectural government and obtain Manufacturer Registration (MR). Foreign manufacturers, on the other hand, must register their manufacturing establishments with the PMDA and obtain a Foreign Manufacturer Registration (FMR) certificate. The MR and FMR is a requirement of the application of medical device registration and needs to be obtained prior to the filing.

ABOUT NASAL VENTILATION
THE PROBLEM

When a patient receives sedation, it causes the muscles of the airway to relax leading to a collapsed airway and shallow breathing, which result in oxygen desaturation, pneumonia, and a potentially life threatening complication known as respiratory compromise.
THE SOLUTION

When the SuperNO2VA™  device is placed over the patient’s nose and connected to a gas source positive pressure builds up inside the mask. This pressure helps separate the soft palate from the posterior pharygeal wall and forces oxygen to flow from the nose to the lungs. The SuperNO2VA™  device was designed to create a seal, deliver gas, and generate positive pressure allowing for continuous nasal oxygenation and ventilation during sedation.

APPLICATIONS





Ideal for clinical use in: EGD/TEE; Colonoscopy, Bronchoscopy, Fiberoptic Intubation, Laryngoscopy, MRI


The SuperNO2VA™ device is designed to:

Provide a superior seal, maintain upper airway patency, and provide ventilatory support to all sedation cases, particularly intra-oral procedures (e.g. Upper Endoscopy, TEE, Bronchoscopy, etc.)
Provide supplemental oxygen and positive pressure to patients both inside and outside an operating room, including during transport while using the secondary oxygen port
Deliver higher FiO2 during oxygen supplementation compared to nasal cannula & oxygen facemasks

Supports the benefits of nasal ventilation compared to full face mask ventilation1:

Lower peak airway pressures
Higher tidal volumes (up to 4 times)
Uninterrupted oxygenation & ventilation
