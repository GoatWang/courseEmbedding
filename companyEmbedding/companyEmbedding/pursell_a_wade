                    Wade Pursell is currently the executive vice president and chief financial officer of SM Energy Company. Mr. Pursell joined SM Energy in September 2008. Prior to joining SM Energy, Mr. Pursell was recruited to Helix Energy Solutions in 1997 (formerly Cal Dive International), as vice president and treasurer to understudy and eventually succeed Mr. Jim Nelson, the incumbent chief financial officer. In addition to his transitioning activities, his primary duty was to lead Cal Dive�s IPOs. In November of 2000, he was promoted to chief financial officer, reporting to the chief executive officer. During his tenure, he built and supervised a staff of 120 from the vice presidents of Finance, Accounting (CAO), Tax, Internal Audit, and IT (CIO). During his time with Helix, the company rose from $100 million in revenues and $200 million in EV with two locations to its current status of revenues of more than $2 billion and EV of $5 billion and nine locations and 2,000 employees around the world. To accomplish this, the company needed to execute several complex transactions, which Mr. Pursell orchestrated. Mr. Pursell spent his first ten years following graduation in Arthur Andersen�s Energy Audit Practice. He rose from the position of accountant to senior accountant manager, and eventually to senior manager in the Oilfield Services Industry. Mr. Pursell graduated from the University of Central Arkansas, Conway, Arkansas, with a bachelor of arts in 1987.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
