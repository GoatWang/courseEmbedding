Sam Waksal, Part of the Martha Stewart Insider Trading Scandal, Exits Kadmon as Company Files for $115 Million IPO

June 13, 2016

By Mark Terry, BioSpace.com Breaking News Staff

Kadmon Corporation, headquartered in New York, filed on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise $115 million. Kadmon with list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KDMN.
 

Kadmon focuses on developing products for unmet medical needs. Its produce pipeline focuses on autoimmune and fibrotic diseases, oncology and genetic diseases. On June 3, Kadmon announced that its first patient had been dosed in a Phase II clinical trial of KD025 for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a chronic, ultimately fatal disease that causes lung tissue scarring. KD025 is a rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2) inhibitor.
 

“This study marks Kadmon’s entry into the field of fibrosis, a disease area where we believe ROCK2 inhibition represents a promising new therapeutic approach,” ‘said Harlan Waksal, president and chief executive officer of Kadmon, in a statement. “Based on our preclinical studies demonstrating the potential anti-fibrotic effects of KD025, we believe our drug may have clinical utility in IPF, a significant unmet medical need.”
 

On April 14, the company released preclinical data regarding its anti-PD-L1/IL-15 bi-functional fusion protein, KD033, which stimulates long-lasting and persistent immunity to tumors. The data showed that KD033 suppressed tumor growth in various in vivo models, effectively blocked the PD-L1 pathway, and targeted IL-15 cytokine activity, activating natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells.
 

The company also markets Ribasphere, for hepatitis C infection, Qsymia for weight loss, and Tetrabenazine for movement disorders caused by Huntington’s disease.
 

The S-1 filing also indicated that the company’s founder, Sam Waksal, resigned from the company. Sam Waksal’s brother, Harlan, is the head of the company. Sam Waksal is famous, or perhaps infamous, for being involved in the insider trading case that sent Martha Stewart to prison. Along with Sam Waksal’s own prison sentence, the SEC barred him from serving as an officer in a public company, which is likely why he left Kadmon.
 

According to the filings, Sam Waksal will receive $3 million in severance, up to $6.75 million in various milestone payments, and up to $15 million as part of various development deals.

Basically what happened LINK http://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/13/martha-stewart-ordeal-changed-me-sam-waksal.html was that Sam Waksal, founder and chief executive officer of ImClone Systems just days before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was to reject its application for cancer drug Erbitux in 2001, attempted to unload company stock and told various family members and friends that they should, too. When news of the rejection was released, the shares plummeted.
 

In the case of Martha Stewart, she had unloaded ImClone shares based on illegally obtained information from her broker. Stewart served five months in federal prison and some time on house arrest.


Waksal, sentenced in 2003, didn’t get out of prison until 2009, a year after Eli Lilly acquired ImClone for $6.5 billion. Erbitux also was approved by the FDA in 2004.
 

Sam Waksal founded Kadmon, and brought in Harlan to act as chief executive officer. Harlan Waksal was also a co-founder of ImClone.

Convicted ImClone Systems (LLY) Boss Becomes Chief Of Innovation At Kadmon Corporation While Brother Harlan W. Waksal, M.D Takes CEO Post  











Tweet








9/24/2014 8:16:08 PM












September 25, 2014

By Jessica Wilson, BioSpace.com Breaking News Staff


Kadmon Corporation, LLC, the New York, NY-based biopharmaceutical company, announced yesterday that Samuel Waksal has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer and will be replaced by Harlan Waksal, his brother, who has served on the board since April 2014. Samuel Waksal will remain with Kadmon as Chief of Innovation, Science and Strategy.

The Waksal brothers have had a long career in the biotech space, which included founding ImClone Systems Incorporated, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company. The career has been marked with scandal, however, for Samuel Waksal, who was convicted on charges of insider trading, and served a five-year sentence. (To put this in context, he was involved in the same scandal that put Martha Stewart in federal prison.) As part of his 2003 settlement with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, Samuel Waksal agreed to a lifetime ban on helming a publicly traded company.

The change in leadership at Kadmon Corporation could be a step to prepare the company for an IPO, which could not take place with Samuel Waksal as CEO. In the press release announcing the leadership change, Kadmon stated, “While the company is continuing to explore its strategic and financial opportunities, including an initial public offering, no specific timelines have been set.”

Despite the coy statement, Samuel Waksal has not been shy about stating his determination for a Kadmon IPO. In fact, yesterday, he said in an interview with CNBC that the company plans to file a form S-1 with the SEC by the end of 2014, which is a preparatory step in an IPO.

In addition, as early as September 2013, he told Bloomberg, “We haven’t seen a biotech market like this since 2000. You get these windows, you get companies funded, you get shareholders that are interested in an approach, a strategy, a technology, a management team, and often, you really get big winners."


In the press release, Harlan Waksal expressed his enthusiasm for, “building on the foundation of forward-thinking science, clinical research, and product pipeline, including our current clinical candidates, envisioned and put together by Sam and our management team.”

Kadmon currently offers treatments for liver diseases, with a pipeline that includes novel medicines in the areas of oncology, immunology and infectious, neurodegenerative and ophthalmic diseases. The company’s research targets the metabolomics and signaling pathways associated with disease.

Kadmon Corporation (originally Kadmon Pharmaceuticals) is a biopharmaceutical company based in New York City. It also has operations in Warrendale, PA and Brighton, MA. The company was founded in 2009 by Samuel D. Waksal,[2][3] founder and former CEO of ImClone Systems, now fully merged into Eli Lilly and Company. Waksal had served a federal prison sentence stemming from his fiduciary role as CEO in the 2001 ImClone stock trading case. When released in 2009 he was barred from serving as an officer for any publicly traded company but Kadmon was privately financed.[4][5]
In September 2014, amid plans to take the company to an IPO Harlan W. Waksal, brother of Samuel Waksal, became President and Chief Executive Officer while Samuel Waksal remained on with the title Chief of Innovation, Science and Strategy.[6] In early 2016 Sam Waksal left Kadmon and in June the company filed paperwork for its IPO.[7][8] On July 27, 2016 the company's stock began trading on the NYSE under the symbol KDMN.[9]
Product Acquisitions[edit]
During Waksal's leadership of ImClone the company was engaged in early stage research projects for 15 years before filing its first drug application.[10] Kadmon however immediately began acquiring drugs further advanced - either already marketed in the US or in the later stages of clinical development.[11] It acquired the Warrendale, PA-based company Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals and their Ribasphere and topotecan products.[12] It also signed an agreement with Ontario, Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals for their Hepatitis C drugs ribavirin and taribavirin (now KD024).[13] Cancer drugs XL647[10] and XL844[11] were acquired from Exelixis. An inhibitor of several protein kinases, XL647 (KD019) entered Phase II clinical trial for certain indications of non-small cell lung cancer.[14][15] and in polycystic kidney disease.[16] XL844 is an inhibitor of protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2 and may increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to radiation therapy.[17]
In an acquisition atypical for a biotechnology company, an 1800-year-old Chinese herbal formula was added to Kadmon's portfolio. PhytoCeutica's PHY906 (KD018) is a formula of four botanical products that had long been used for the treatment of gastrointestinal distress. Preclinical studies have shown it to enhance the therapeutic activity of several anticancer agents.[18] In 2014 KD018 was in a Phase II trial in combination with irinotecan in metastatic colon cancer.[19]
In 2011 the company acquired rights from Brighton, MA-based Nano Terra Inc.[20] for their Pharmacomer Technology research platform and three drug candidates in clinical development.[21] These compounds include SLx-2119 (KD025), an inhibitor to Rho kinase 2 (ROCK2) with possible potential in fibrotic disease[22] and focal cerebral ischemia.[23] SLx-4090 (KD026) is a triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitor being explored for metabolic disorders.[24] SLx-2101 (KD027) is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, a class of drug used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.[25]
In 2012 the rights to salirasib (KD032), a Ras antagonist in development for cancer therapy,[26] were acquired from Concordia Pharmaceuticals of Fort Lauderdale, FL.[27] It also acquired the rights from Burlington, MA-based Dyax Corp. for DX-2400,[28] a Matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MPP-14) tarageted monoclonal antibody intended to inhibit tumor blood vessel formation and metastasis.[29]
As of December 2012 Kadmon was developing a drug for gastric cancer[30]
Products[edit]
As of 2012 Kadmon produces four drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States:

RIBISPHERE (ribavirin, USP) tablets for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C[31]
INFERGEN (interferon alfacon-1) injection for the treatment of hepatitis C[32]
AMPHOTEC (amphotericin b), an injectable anti-fungal drug[33]
Topotecan Hydrochloride for Injection, approved for certain indications of small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer.[34]

Kadmon Corporation Announces the Appointment of Dr. Harlan W. Waksal as President and Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Samuel Waksal as Chief of Innovation, Science and Strategy



NEW YORK, September 24, 2014 – Kadmon Corporation, LLC announces today that Harlan W. Waksal, M.D., has joined the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer after serving as a member of the Company’s Board of Managers since April 2014. Dr. Harlan Waksal replaces Samuel D. Waksal, Ph.D., one of the founders of Kadmon, in the Chief Executive role. Dr. Samuel Waksal remains with the Company as Chief of Innovation, Science and Strategy.
Dr. Harlan Waksal brings over 30 years of executive and governance leadership in the life sciences to Kadmon, a tenure which includes the co-founding, with Dr. Samuel Waksal, of ImClone Systems Incorporated, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company. “I look forward to continuing my work with Kadmon in my new role as President and Chief Executive Officer, and building on the foundation of forward-thinking science, clinical research, and product pipeline, including our current clinical candidates, envisioned and put together by Sam and our management team,” said Dr. Harlan Waksal. “As we look to the future, it is my goal to ensure that the Company is well-positioned to take advantage of value-building corporate, strategic and financial options.”
Dr. Samuel Waksal remains with the Company as Chief of Innovation, Science and Strategy and is now responsible for oversight of Kadmon’s clinical development, research, treatment innovation and scientific strategies. “I look forward to continuing Kadmon’s scientific and clinical work in my new role, and to pioneering new medicines addressing areas of serious unmet medical need,” said Dr. Samuel Waksal.
While the Company is continuing to explore its strategic and financial opportunities, including an initial public offering, no specific timelines have been set. Dr. Samuel Waksal remains Chairman of the Company and will transition from that role in the event that the Company elects to pursue an initial public offering.
