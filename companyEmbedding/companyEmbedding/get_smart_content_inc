                      Default                    

                      Non-Targeted Content                    

                      Prior to using Get Smart Content, all of Thunderbird's website visitors were served a generic slider with five distinct messages on the homepage. 

From brand messaging to investor relations, Thunderbird struggled with serving relevant, targeted content and was forced to create a one-size-fits-all experience.                     



                      Annie                    

                      Apparel Manufacturer                    

                      Annie works for an apparel company and is researching precision weavers in anticipation of a new line. She reaches Thunderbird’s site and firmographic data identifies her as part of the apparel industry. 

As a first time visitor to the site, Annie sees content and products relevant to her industry before she’s identified herself.                     



                      Andrew                    

                      Automotive Executive                    

                      Andrew has worked in automotive manufacturing for years and recently had some of his equipment break. Since it’s a substantial expense, he’s concerned about buying something flimsy that will land him in the same position. 

When he hit Thunderbird’s site, he sees relevant messaging for his exact needs because firmographic data identifies him as part of the automotive industry.                      



                      Billy                    

                      Beverage Packaging Supplier                    

                      Billy manufactures an array of packaging, but aluminum cans are the bulk of his work since he’s in the beverage industry. He knows more precise cutters will mean less leftovers and increase his margins. 

As he’s researching alternatives, he finds Thunderbird’s site and sees prominent messaging about their precision. Through the integration with Demandbase, Thunderbird was able to serve him the right content for his industry.

                      Non-Targeted Content                    

                      Prior to using Get Smart Content, all of VidMedia's website visitors were messaged the same, regardless of where they were in the buyer’s journey. 

First time site visitors received a “Free Trial” message before even knowing the platforms key value propositions, while late stage visitors in an active trial still received the same untargeted message. 

This one-size-fits-all experience put the burden on the visitor to find the information they were looking for.                     



                      Alex                    

                      Anonymous Visitor                    

                      Alex’s company is considering a bigger investment in video content, but they’re concerned about having the right tool to manage it all. He conducts a few searches online and lands on VidMedia’s homepage. 

Since he has not visited the site before, Alex sees an offer for a webinar to help him start his research. This content offer also prompts Alex to identify himself early in his search.                     



                      Wanda                    

                      Webinar Registrant                    

                      Wanda’s firm is considering moving to VidMedia but she’s not too familiar with how the tool has been used in her industry before. She registered for a webinar with VidMedia last week to learn more, and now she’s back on the site looking for some technical details. 

Through our integration with Marketing Automation, Wanda is identified as a known contact that has already registered for the upcoming webinar, so she is reminded about the webinar and offered additional resources in the meantime.




                      Sally                    

                      Sales Qualified Lead                    

                      Sally has had multiple conversations with VidMedia’s sales team, but others in her department aren’t sure about it yet so she’s doing some final research to get a few technical details right. 

When she comes back to the VidMedia site, she is identified as a sales qualified lead and sees a compelling, relevant use case to pass to her team and messaging consistent with what she’s hearing from the sales team.

                      Non-Targeted Content                    

                      Prior to using Get Smart Content, Visit Liberty struggled with creating meaningful connections with website visitors looking to get more information about the city. 

With so many desirable qualities to brag about and partners to showcase, Visit Liberty’s site was overflowing with content and filled with competing messaging.                     



                      Frank                    

                      Outdoor Enthusiast                    

                      Frank loves camping - he goes out into the woods a couple of times each month. To get ideas for new spots, he’s an avid reader of adventure and nature blogs, which is how he stumbled on the website for the small town of Liberty. 

Since he clicked through a link on a nature blog, the site identifies him as someone interested in the outdoors and shows him relevant messaging about Liberty’s diverse outdoor adventures.                     



                      Felicity                    

                      Foodie                    

                      A lifelong foodie, Felicity has recently started exploring new ways to cook seafood and is eager to try some fresh faire on her upcoming vacation. She’s been searching for inspiring foodie blogs and restaurant recommendations , which led her to the website for Liberty. 

When she gets to the Visit Liberty site, she is identified as a food fan because she is coming from a food-related search and sees messaging about the town’s fresh seafood.                     



                      Claire and Teddy                    

                      Engaged Couple                    

                      Claire and Teddy have just started planning their upcoming nuptials and are looking for a location that’s out-of-the-way but can still host their large families. While visiting a wedding blog, they see a reference to Liberty and click through to the website.  

Since they’re coming from a wedding site, they see messaging about the city’s wedding amenities right on the home page.

                      Non-Targeted Content                    

                      Alfheim Lodges is known worldwide for its personalized service, but prior to using Get Smart Content, it was unable to showcase this attention to detail on its website. 

Upon returning to the website, all visitors were greeted with generic, untargeted messaging.                    



                      Andrew                    

                      Extreme Skier                     

                      Andrew is planning an adventurous ski weekend with his buddies, and they’ve finally agreed on a location and dates. He’s been to the Alfheim Lodges site before to look for amenities, but now he’s looking to book and wants to make sure the hotel has what he needs.

Based on his previous on-site behavior, the site identifies his interest in skiing amenities and prioritizes that messaging, so Andrew knows this is the hotel for him.                     



                      Elliot                    

                      Executive Event Manager                    

                      Elliot is planning his team’s annual retreat. He wants to give his team a unique experience but is also concerned about cost, so he’s been on the Alfheim Lodges site before searching online for group offers. 

When he returns, the site presents him with relevant messaging about the hotel’s affordable rates based on his previous engagement with group packages and discounts.                     



                      Savannah                    

                      Social Media Fan                    

                      Savannah is a huge fan of Alfheim Lodges - she loves their luxurious accommodations and enjoys seeing posts about their new locations on Facebook. A few times, she’s clicked through those posts to get a sneak peek at their upcoming locations. 

When she visits the site now, she’s identified as a social fan and sees messaging encouraging her to share her experience and join the loyalty program.
